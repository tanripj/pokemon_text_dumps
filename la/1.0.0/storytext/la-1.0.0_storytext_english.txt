Looks like he finally found his courage...[VAR 0114(0013)]
The late lord’s child... He’s evolved![VAR 0114(0014)]
His true bravery lay not in crossing the sea, but in\nfinding the strength to face hardship head-on.[VAR 0114(0014)]
You gotta be joking me! Why’d the puny\none evolve?![VAR 0114(0023)]
Uh...sisters? Something’s not right...[VAR 0114(0024)]

You need to gather all the wisps that were\nscattered across Hisui...[VAR 0114(0056)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]If you don’t, something horrible will happen...\nPlease, [VAR 0100(0000)]! You have to\r\ndo this![VAR 0114(0056)]

“Once there were two.\nAnd one looked upon time’s steady pace.\r\nAnd one looked upon the expanse of space.\c\n“And the two set out:\nthe fullness of future did they seek,\r\nthe world’s far end would they greet.\c\n“Two different paths—\neach walking alone a path their own,\r\nthough they walk with almighty Sinnoh.”\c
“O you, who at the world’s far-off end dwell,\nI know your wish—it is my wish as well.\c\n“My own beloved is now gone from me,\ndeparted to a place I cannot reach.\c\n“My old companions have left me behind,\ntheir faces faded into days gone by.\c\n“Still to my breast I clutch this hopeless dream,\na futile wish for us once more to meet.\c\n“O you, who at the world’s far-off end dwell,\nI know your wish—it is my wish as well.\c\n“But ours are cold and endless winter days,\nwarmed only by memories locked away.”\c
“No claws nor fangs, no strength to claim—\nno man could hope to hold his own\r\nto mighty Pokémon.\c\n“But bolts of light rained down one day,\nten times they fell, ten times struck true\r\nupon ten Pokémon.\c\n“Then to weak man did these ten turn,\nhis strength to be, and all were blessed\r\nby loyal Pokémon.\c\n“Were not these bolts a gift to man?\nWere they not your almighty grace,\r\ngreat Sinnoh, paragon?”\c
“Ten Pokémon, the ancient hero’s\nloyal retinue—\r\nthough these companions now are gone,\r\ntheir noble duty passes on\r\nto generations new.\c\n“The people thank the ten descendants\nfor their gen’rous toil\r\nby lining vessels built to last\r\nwith water clear and choice repast\r\nbefore the arenas’ soil.”\c
“Long and longer yet ago,\nCelestica was here.\r\nBut folk and town alike,\r\nboth did disappear.\c\n“In time, came new folk sailing,\nsailing ’cross the sea,\r\ncalled by their love for Sinnoh,\r\ngreat and almighty.\c\n“But diff’rent were the Sinnoh\nthat each folk did hold dear,\r\nAnd bitter strife and angry war\r\nwere always at the near.\c\n“’Celestica’ they called themselves,\nthe name not theirs to take.\r\nYet claim it from the past they did,\r\nfor tragic quarrel’s sake.\c\n“So once again did our name live,\nthough all our people gone.\r\nBut even if the name endures,\r\nits heart does not live on.”\c
“When that Pokémon was born,\nintelligence bloomed among us,\r\nenriching all our morrows.\c\n“When that Pokémon was born,\nemotions bloomed among us,\r\ngiving us joy and sorrows.\c\n“When that Pokémon was born,\nwillpower bloomed among us\r\nto act and not to wallow.”\c
“O, lake in alabaster lands of ice,\nlake brimming o’er with rich acuity...\c\n“How many seek the Pokémon that shows\nitself there, out to answer its words true\r\nand earn its boon through ingenuity?\c\n“But should they fail to understand its words\nand let its questions meet with no reply,\r\ntheir minds will be wiped clean of memory...\c\n“O, lake in alabaster lands of ice,\ndepths where rich acuity goes to sink.”\c
“Throughout Hisui, plates lie scattered—\nplates with powers all diverse.\c\n“Forever lasting, each inscribed\nwith eternal prayer’s verse.\c\n“Through space and time will they bear\nsecret wishes for the universe.”\c
“I set the bones of Pokémon\nadrift upon the river.\c\n“I let my memories flow on,\nadrift upon the river.\c\n“And to the ocean they will flow,\nperhaps around the world to go.\c\n“How many bones in days now gone\nhave I now set adrift from me?\c\n“How many bones in days to come\nwill I yet set adrift to sea?\c\n“While every gift with which I part\ntakes a sliver of my heart.”\c
“’Twas long ago he earned the name ’hero’...\c\n“He led his retinue, ten Pokémon,\nagainst the almighty unknowable.\c\n“In battle did his valiance proclaim\nat last the strength of humble humankind.\c\n“The great unknowable approved this feat,\nand to its domain of no place returned.”\c
“’Let our wishes reach heaven’s crown,’\nthe people together vowed.\c\n“So they and their Pokémon bore stone\nto the peak of heaven’s mount.\c\n“The people carved the gathered stones\nin shapes of Pokémon—\c\n“the ten Pokémon that Sinnoh shone\nits almighty light upon.”\c
“Wintry... Austere...\nBrimming with strange power...\c\n“Certainly the land of Hisui\nbears some resemblance to Sinjoh.\c\n“Here, where the ancient Sinnoh people\nwere born, I will spend an eternity...\r\nuntil the one with the mission appears.”\c
“Sootfoot, humble root—\nharvest it, and peel it.\c\n“Broiled, baked, or steamed will do,\njust let nobody steal it.\c\n“Mash the root, then knead the mash,\nthen once more heat it over—\c\n“Grill it only till it browns—\nuse Ember, not Flamethrower.\c\n“Now harken well, and listen closely:\nthe wise adore potato mochi.\c\n“A day spent eating all in reach,\nis no day wasted, if you ask me.”\c
“The fieldlands rush by underhoof\nas Wyrdeer carries me astride—\c\n“Companions of mine run with us\nand Pokémon dash alongside.\c\n“We come to stand where wind had swept\nand old days play before my eyes...\c\n“The memories come running through,\nlinking this place to times gone by.\c\n“Time and space here blend together\nand enfold my heart as I remember.”\c
“The flow of time never stops...\nThe past, future, and present...\c\n“Space is ever-expanding dimensions...\nOur spirits, too, are as space...”\c
“Heaven’s crown,\nnearest to almighty Sinnoh...\c\n“Power of almighty Sinnoh,\ngather as stone at heaven’s mount.\c\n“Stone, let your power flow—\ndistort and bend the world around you.”\c
“Once there was a god of field,\nand once there was a god of spring.\c\n“Upon Hisui’s winds it wheeled,\nbrought life to every growing thing.\c\n“’Where go you when you are not here?’\nasked I one day the god of spring.\c\n“No answer would it give me clear,\nbut still did I have an inkling.\c\n“There is no great dark truth untold—\nit simply does not like the cold.”\c
“Offer only friendship to those around you.\c\n“Angering ??? in turn confounds you.\c\n“Sorrowing ??? will in woe drown you.\c\n“A land, once riven, cannot become new.\c\n“Let only peace and amity surround you.”\c
“When first this land was formed,\nman and ’mon lived happily,\r\nsharing all that they could see,\r\nby kind acts born and warmed.\c\n“One Pokémon then proposed\nthat they should always ready be\r\nto help the humans should they need,\r\nand let their presence be disclosed.\c\n“And that is why, to this day,\nnot all Pokémon do flee\r\nwhen a human they do see—\r\nthey leap out where tall grasses sway.”\c
“Once it shone upon us all,\nwith all the warmth of welcome sun.\c\n“But now we weep, to grief we fall,\nstarved of light now it has gone.\c\n“And some they go, despair withal,\nin search of it they reel and run.\c\n“They quit their hearths, abandon hall,\nand leave our lands to be undone.\c\n“And when they’re gone beyond recall,\nthis land will be a home to none.\r\nThis land will only ever be a home to Pokémon.”\c
“The power of defeated giants infuses this Plate.”\c
“The rightful bearer of a Plate draws from the\nPlate it holds.”\c
“The third being raged, raining down bolts\nof anger.”\c
“The powers of Plates are shared\namong Pokémon.”\c
“Two beings of time and space set free from the\nOriginal One.”\c
“The rift is born of disorder on the other side of\nthis world.”\c
“The rules of time and space change within the\nopposite world.”\c
“When the universe was created, its shards\nbecame this Plate.”\c
“The being poured the remains of its power into\nstone and buried it deep.”\c
“The Original One breathed alone before the\nuniverse came.”\c
“Where all creation was born, that is the being’s\nplace of origin.”\c
“It gathers power from the Plates, listening for\nthe flute’s song.”\c
“The other side of this world was given by the\nOriginal One to its raging third.”\c
“Three beings were born to bind time\nand space.”\c
“Two make matter, and three make spirit, shaping\nthe world.”\c
“That which fills the other side of the world can\nshape the rage and mold it.”\c
“The Original One is in all things.\nThe Original One is nowhere at all.”\c
“Three beings whose power can hold both time\nand space fixed.”\c
“From all creations, over all creations, does the\nOriginal One watch over all.”\c

I’m here to give thanks to the guardian of this\nshrine, who watches over all in Jubilife Village.[VAR 0114(005D)]
And you, child? If you’re here with a prayer for\nthe shrine, perhaps my charms can help.\c\nTell me—what is your wish?[VAR 0114(005D)]
Lose fewer items
Faint less frequently
Stay in good health
No wishes for me!
What do the charms do?
Oh, I have just the charm for that, my dear.\nIt’s yours for [VAR 0204(0001,002C)]. How does that sound?[VAR 0114(005D)]
Oh my, was one charm not enough?\c\nWell, if you want to be extra safe, how about\nanother for [VAR 0204(0001,002C)]?[VAR 0114(005D)]
You’re carrying two of these charms, yet you wish\nfor another? Goodness me.\c\nI suppose I can offer you a third for [VAR 0204(0001,002C)].\nDo we have a deal?[VAR 0114(005D)]
Three charms in your satchel and you’re still not\nsatisfied, child? A fourth will cost you [VAR 0204(0001,002C)].\r\nDo you truly wish to purchase it?[VAR 0114(005D)]
Your poor satchel must be bursting at the seams!\nBut if four charms haven’t sated you, well...\c\nI can part with a fifth for [VAR 0204(0001,002C)]. Now, think\ncarefully. Is this how you wish to spend your coin?[VAR 0114(005D)]
Greedy child. Any more charms would be nothing\nbut a burden!\c\nShould you lose any of the charms you already\nhave, you can always find me here.[VAR 0114(005D)]
This charm is imbued with the mysterious powers\nof the shrine guardian. May it serve you well![VAR 0114(005D)]
You don’t need it? Well, that’s fine too.\nIt’s good to have faith in one’s own abilities.[VAR 0114(005D)]
Do you have any other wishes?[VAR 0114(005D)]
With charms in your satchel, you can loosen up\nand embrace opportunities that come knocking.\c\nIsn’t that just wonderful?[VAR 0114(005D)]
Come again should you ever wish for another\ncharm. May the shrine guardian watch over you.[VAR 0114(005D)]
Ah. It seems you’ve not enough coin, child.\nAnd I’ve no charm for instant wealth![VAR 0114(005D)]
Very well. There’s much to be said for relying on\none’s own abilities. Good luck out there, child.[VAR 0114(005D)]
I’ll take it
Perhaps not
If it’s lost items you wish to prevent, I would\nsuggest the Tempting Charm for you, my dear.\c\nShould you ever faint, it magically becomes the\nfirst item to vanish from your satchel, taking the\r\nplace of other items that would have been lost.[VAR 0114(005D)]
If you wish to keep yourself from fainting, the\nSurvival Charm is what you need.\c\nSimply possessing this mystical item makes\none less likely to faint while out exploring.[VAR 0114(005D)]
If good health is your greatest wish, the\nWarding Charm is your friend.\c\nIt gives one the mysterious ability to escape\nthe effects of status conditions inflicted by\r\nwild Pokémon’s moves.[VAR 0114(005D)]
I hope you followed all that, child. Now, tell me\nwhat it is you wish for.[VAR 0114(005D)]

You there! Stop where you are.[VAR 0114(0022)]
You don’t appear to be frightened to see me.[VAR 0114(0022)]
How could I be so careless![VAR 0114(0022)]
You let your guard down quite carelessly for\nsomeone out here to observe things with care![VAR 0114(0022)]
Daring to approach me rather than turn tail and\nrun? You’ve got courage—I’ll give you that.[VAR 0114(0022)]
I didn’t think the day would come when I would\nbe caught with my guard down.[VAR 0114(0022)]
Now you face the eldest of the Miss Fortunes!\nThis unlucky Charm will ensure you fall in battle![VAR 0114(0022)]
Krgh! Quite formidable, aren’t you?[VAR 0114(0022)]
But this was only a test. Now I know more about\nhow you fight, and I won’t hold back next time.[VAR 0114(0022)]
Really? Is that all you can do?[VAR 0114(0022)]
Well, I’ll just be taking your things then.\c\nDon’t think too harshly of me. We all do what we\nmust to survive in this life—that’s all this is.[VAR 0114(0022)]
Hey, you! Not one more step![VAR 0114(0023)]
You saw me out here and didn’t even think to\nturn and run?[VAR 0114(0023)]
You got the jump on me?![VAR 0114(0023)]
Seriously? You didn’t even notice someone\nsneaking up on you? What an amateur...[VAR 0114(0023)]
I’ll make you regret that confidence.[VAR 0114(0023)]
Not! As if I’d actually let you catch me off guard.\nIt was all a trap, laid out by yours truly. I swear![VAR 0114(0023)]
Now you face the middle sister of the infamous\nMiss Fortunes! And this Clover plucks you![VAR 0114(0023)]
Rrrghhh! I can’t believe you beat me again![VAR 0114(0023)]
I bet the people in the Galaxy Team actually\ntreat you like you’re worth something...[VAR 0114(0023)]
Over that quick? That wasn’t even a battle...\nMore like a bad joke.[VAR 0114(0023)]
That’s what you get when you face off against\nsomeone with my kind of skill.\c\nNow hand over all your stuff.[VAR 0114(0023)]
Where do you think you’re going?[VAR 0114(0024)]
Think you can defeat me? Too bad. It would’ve\nbeen cute to see you try to run.[VAR 0114(0024)]
What?! I failed to detect an attack?![VAR 0114(0024)]
I was watching for ages as you went about\nplaying at your silly “survey” work.[VAR 0114(0024)]
Now I’m going to make you regret passing up\nyour chance to run![VAR 0114(0024)]
Shameless! Who attacks from behind?! I’ll make\nyou pay for your brazen disrespect![VAR 0114(0024)]
Come on, Toxicroak! Let’s pickle this one\nin poison![VAR 0114(0024)]
I lost? Even with Toxicroak at my side?[VAR 0114(0024)]
You little... You will pay for this embarrassment!\nI swear I will make you pay with interest![VAR 0114(0024)]
That wasn’t even a challenge. I hope this loss\nhaunts your dreams, night after night after night.\c\nOh, but maybe you won’t have to worry about\ntroublesome dreams. I bet the frustration of\r\nlosing to me will keep you up all night![VAR 0114(0024)]
As long as the Miss Fortune sisters have me and\nmy Toxicroak, it’ll only be a matter of time\r\nbefore our name is spoken in terror, far and wide.\c\nI’ll just be taking your things now, to help us on\nour rise to such infamous glory.[VAR 0114(0024)]
It seems she dropped something when she fled...

Welcome to my realm, located beyond both\ntime and space.
It is well that thou art here.
I am that which humans call Arceus.
Now, I wish to know thine appearance.
What is thy name?
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]...
Soon thou shalt find thyself in a world strange\nto thee...
A world inhabited by wondrous creatures that\nhumans call “Pokémon.”
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]...
Seek out all Pokémon, and thou shalt find me\nonce more.
[~ 10]
Wake up!
Ohhh... Do wake up, won’t you?
Are you alive, my [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl?![VAR 0114(0004)]
You gave me quite the shock, falling from the sky\nlike that...\c\nBut thank goodness, you seem unharmed![VAR 0114(0004)]
Who are you...?
Where am I...?
I’d like to ask you the same!\c\nI mean...you fell out of the SKY, you understand.\nCome now—who in the world does that?![VAR 0114(0004)]
Why, this is Prelude Beach, of course.\c\nDear me, did the shock of your fall somehow\naddle your memory?[VAR 0114(0004)]
I must say, your clothing is...unusual.\nYou wouldn’t happen to have an acquaintance in\r\nthese parts, would you?[VAR 0114(0004)]
I doubt it...
I don’t know...
I see... You seem to be in a bit of a pickle.\c\nMight I offer some directions? Do you have\nsomewhere around here you could stay?[VAR 0114(0004)]
No, nowhere
I don’t know...
So you don’t know anyone here, and you don’t\neven know where to spend the night...\c\nWell...this is a proper pickle indeed. Are you\nquite sure you’ll be able to survive?[VAR 0114(0004)]
I don’t know what to do
Somehow, I guess...
I see... Well, no gentleman would abandon\na person in such need![VAR 0114(0004)]
Krooo!
Fooom!
Plish plash!
Oh my, I’d completely forgotten! I had just\ncaught up to these three runaway Pokémon when\r\nyou tumbled out of the sky...\c\nIt’s almost as if they knew you’d appear here![VAR 0114(0004)]
Ah, but do you even know what a Pokémon is?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Of course I do
Not exactly...
My, that’s a relief! Though you fell from the sky,\nit seems we have some common ground, eh?\c\nYes, well, these three Pokémon belong to me,\nmysterious creatures that they are![VAR 0114(0004)]
You...you don’t? You truly have traveled a long\nway, haven’t you?\c\nWell! These three here are what we call Pokémon.\nVery mysterious creatures, you see. Marvelous.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh yes, and...what might your name be?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Oho! So you’re called [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nThat name has quite the ring to it! I imagine it\nmust have some lovely meaning.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh, but I do apologize! I haven’t even\nintroduced myself!\c\nMy name is Laventon. I am something of a\nPokémon Professor.[VAR 0114(0005)]
That is to say, I’m a scholar seeking to deepen\nour understanding of Pokémon.\c\nYes, Pokémon such as these three here, whi—[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, blast and bother! My darling Pokémon!\nWhy must you run from me again?![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m terribly sorry, but do you think you could\nhelp me round them up? I beg you![VAR 0114(0005)]
Wait, you three! Waiiit![VAR 0114(0005)]
Er, I beg your pardon! Please! I’ll be in quite\nsome trouble if we don’t catch these Pokémon![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 46]
There’s a glowing, beeping object over there...
The strange, beeping object is still lying on\nthe ground...
[~ 49]
You found something that resembles a phone!
It’s probably your phone, but it’s changed shape.\nYou feel a strange power emanating from it...
A message appeared on the screen!
“I bestow upon thee this Arc Phone and\nthy mission: seek out all Pokémon.”
[~ 54]
*sigh*\nAlas... Yet another miss![VAR 0114(0005)]
Aha! I’m glad you’ve come to my rescue, my new\nfriend from the sky![VAR 0114(0005)]
I tried catching my little runaways by tossing\nsome Poké Balls their way, but I’m not the best\r\nat this sort of thing, you see...[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’d love to give you a go at it, but perhaps\nI should tell you a bit about these three first?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Krooo!
Now, that one is Rowlet![VAR 0114(0005)]
Rowlet can photosynthesize like a plant, and\napparently it battles using its sharp feathers.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Fooom!
That one over there is Cyndaquil![VAR 0114(0005)]
The fire burning on Cyndaquil’s back will flare\nup whenever it is surprised or irate.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Plish plash!
The Pokémon near the pond is Oshawott.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oshawott naps while floating on the water, and it\ncan battle using the shell-like object on its belly![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh my! I nearly forgot to cover the most crucial\nthing—how to go about catching Pokémon![VAR 0114(0005)]
Here you are, my [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl: Poké Balls! Throw these at\nPokémon to catch them.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Ah, but that won’t do for an explanation, will it?\nI do apologize. Let me be more thorough.\c\nNow, I’ve mentioned already that Pokémon are\nstrange, marvelous creatures.[VAR 0114(0005)]
What’s so strange about them, you ask?\c\nWell, each and every Pokémon is able to shrink\nitself down to minuscule size![VAR 0114(0005)]
And that’s where Poké Balls come in!\c\nPoké Balls are a recent invention, you see.\nThrow one of them at a Pokémon, and...[VAR 0114(0005)]
why, the Pokémon will shrink down and fit inside\nthe ball, comfy as can be. And with that, you’ve\r\ncaught a Pokémon![VAR 0114(0005)]
I know we’ve just met, but I’m afraid I’ve no one\nelse to turn to.\c\nI’d be awfully grateful if you could catch my\nthree runaways![VAR 0114(0005)]
Now, the proper technique is to take aim at the\nPokémon, then let the ball fly—it’s quite simple!\c\nThough far be it from me to say so, I suppose,\ngiven my own dire lack of skill in this area.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m sure you have many questions after your fall\nfrom the sky, but let’s go one step at a time, eh?\c\nBesides, catching those Pokémon is to their\nbenefit, too![VAR 0114(0005)]
Wait! Please, don’t go. I need you to catch my\nrunaway Pokémon![VAR 0114(0005)]
Did...did you just try to throw a Poké Ball at me?\nI’d really rather you not![VAR 0114(0005)]
Now now, please aim carefully before throwing!\nThese Poké Balls are quite valuable, you know.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Ah yes, I’m afraid that can happen...\c\nPoké Balls are hardly 100 percent foolproof.\nGive it another go, old [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 81]
Oh, wonderful! You’ve caught a Pokémon![VAR 0114(0005)]
It seems you’ve quite the knack for this Pokémon-\ncatching business, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\r\nJolly useful skill to have around here.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Only two of my darling runaways left now.\c\nStill, this is most unusual. You don’t seem fearful\nof Pokémon in the slightest...[VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 85]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I can hardly believe it, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nIncredible!\c\nYou know, many people fear to even approach\nPokémon—never mind catch them. Bravo, indeed![VAR 0114(0005)]
Just one more to go. Let’s wrap this up sharpish,\nshall we?[VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 88]
Thank you very much, indeed! Oh, what a relief\nto have them all back.\c\nYou see, the three Pokémon you caught have\nonly just arrived at the village to help with our\r\nresearch. They won’t yet listen to anyone.[VAR 0114(0005)]
And as I mentioned, they bolted from the village\nalmost as if they knew you’d come falling...[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]But I must say, [VAR 0100(0000)],\nI was\r\ntaken\r\naback\r\nby\r\nhow\r\nwell\r\nyou\r\nuse\r\nPoké Balls!\c\nHow is it that you catch Pokémon so ably when\nyou’ve only just arrived here?[VAR 0114(0005)]
One can’t help but think there’s a reason you\nappeared here and now...[VAR 0114(0005)]
“Seek out all Pokémon”...[VAR 0114(0005)]
That object is an “Arc Phone,” you say...?\c\nWhat an odd device. Could it be...guiding\nyou somehow?[VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 95]
If you’ll indulge me for a moment, there’s\nsomething I’d like to share with you.\c\nYou see, I have a dream—to compile this region’s\nfirst complete [VAR FF00(0006)]record of its Pokémon[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
We in the field call such a catalog a [VAR FF00(0006)]Pokédex[VAR FF00(0000)].\c\nYes, a proper Pokédex is a wonderful work of\nresearch, containing detailed records of all\r\nthe Pokémon to be found in a region![VAR 0114(0005)]
But...in order to properly document Pokémon,\none must, of course, catch them.[VAR 0114(0005)]
And therein lies the rub, I’m afraid.\c\nPoké Balls have only just been invented, and not\nmany have mastered the skill of using them.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Enter you—a person with a clear talent for\ncatching Pokémon![VAR 0114(0005)]
Your goal is to seek out every Pokémon, and\nmine is to have all those Pokémon caught.\r\nA situation ripe for teamwork, don’t you agree?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Come now! What do you say? Shall we help one\nanother out, my [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl?[VAR 0114(0005)]
You’ve convinced me!
Well, uh...
Then whoever and from wherever you may be,\nI welcome you with open arms!\c\nWe’ve a Pokédex to complete![VAR 0114(0005)]
First things first—let’s get these Pokémon back\nto the village!\c\nThen we’ll sort out your lodgings and find you\nsome proper clothes and a meal and all that.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Follow me, then! Onward to [VAR FF00(0006)]Jubilife Village[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]

Text File : chap_01
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Thank you for your tireless work keeping us safe,\nmy good guardsmen![VAR 0114(0005)]
This young [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]manlady was of great assistance to me\nand my Pokémon, so I hope you’ll forgive my\r\nbringing h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer into the village for a bit![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 2]
Jubilife Village! It’s come a long way thanks to\nthe fine people of the [VAR FF00(0006)]Galaxy Expedition Team[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
This road we’re on now is known to the locals as\nCanala Avenue.[VAR 0114(0005)]
The village was built scarcely two years ago...\nThere’s much to do yet and not many to do it.[VAR 0114(0005)]
And since we know so little of the local Pokémon,\npeople hesitate to set foot outside the village.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Now, that impressive building up ahead of us is\nGalaxy Hall—headquarters for this entire outfit![VAR 0114(0005)]
This way, if you please![VAR 0114(0005)]
I understand you must be more than a tad curious\nabout the village, but do follow me for now.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Now hold on, my [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl! I’m the one giving the\ntour here![VAR 0114(0005)]
Do stick close—we can’t have you getting lost![VAR 0114(0005)]
Quite the impatient one, aren’t we! Come along\nnow, and I’ll continue the tour.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 13]
Oh botheration! I’d almost forgotten![VAR 0114(0005)]
I need to go and report that we successfully\nrecovered the escaped Pokémon!\c\nMight I ask you to wait for me at the canteen?[VAR 0114(0005)]
It’s just past this bridge here, then to the left.\nThe Wallflower, it’s called![VAR 0114(0005)]
Even if you’re a friend of the professor’s, that\ndoesn’t mean you can go anywhere you please!
Your Arc Phone is beeping...
Somehow, it seems to show where you need to\ngo next.
[~ 20]
Well now, aren’t you awfully suspicious?[VAR 0114(000E)]
The Wallflower’s for Galaxy Team folk only.\nWe don’t have seats for outsiders. Move along![VAR 0114(000E)]
Who in the world are you? And what’s that\nbizarre garb you’re wearing?\c\nA Pokémon could slice right through those flimsy\nexcuses for clothes![VAR 0114(0004)]
Who are you? I’ve never seen anyone dressed\nlike you are.\c\nWhat if you were attacked by a Pokémon?\nYou’d be minced meat in those flimsy clothes![VAR 0114(0004)]
Hm. For you to get in here, someone must’ve\nvouched for you...[VAR 0114(0004)]
If the guard let you through, you must have ties\nwith somebody in the village...[VAR 0114(0004)]
Was it Professor Laventon? Do you two know\neach other? He’s from a region a long way off.\c\nNot the most reliable sort, though—letting\nPokémon run off and give him the slip and all...[VAR 0114(0004)]
Three more of ’em got away just a while ago!\c\nIf I hadn’t been resting up after some Pokémon\ndrubbed me with a move called Thunder Shock,\r\nI’d have corralled ’em for sure.\c\nBut the professor, well...[VAR 0114(0004)]
Perhaps you’ve met Professor Laventon?\nHe’s a scholar from a faraway place.\c\nHis Pokémon do get away from him at times,\nthough. It makes me a bit worried for him...[VAR 0114(0004)]
I suppose I’m hardly one to talk—I’ve had some\ntrouble with Pokémon myself.\c\nI was hit by a Pokémon move called Thunder\nShock not long ago and had to take to my bed.\c\nBut the professor...well... I do wonder how long\nhe’ll last.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Unfortunately it’s just as Akari says... I’m a clumsy\nsort of fellow, to put it mildly![VAR 0114(0005)]
Unfortunately it’s just as Rei says... I’m a clumsy\nsort of fellow, to put it mildly![VAR 0114(0005)]
Ack![VAR 0114(0006)]
Professor![VAR 0114(0007)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]But everything will be quite all right now!\c\n[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)] here has agreed to\nhelp\r\nus\r\nwith\r\nour Pokédex![VAR 0114(0005)]
As in...she’s going to join the Survey Corps?\c\nWhat makes you think that’s a good idea?\nWe can’t just take in any misfit who wanders out\r\nof the wilderness![VAR 0114(0006)]
Excuse me? You plan to appoint him to the\nSurvey Corps?\c\nYou can’t just slap a badge on whoever you like\nwithout Captain Cyllene’s permission![VAR 0114(0007)]
I’ll allow it.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Assuming the individual can contribute to the\nSurvey Corps, that is.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Gah?![VAR 0114(0006)]
Captain Cyllene?![VAR 0114(0007)]
I am the captain of the Galaxy Team’s Survey\nCorps. You may call me Cyllene.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Professor Laventon has told me how you helped\nsecure his Pokémon when they slipped his control.\c\nAnd now it seems he would like us to feed and\nhouse you in exchange for your ongoing labor.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Hmm. You look to be 15 or so.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Quite old enough to work for your keep.\c\nBut we can’t simply take on a stranger who\nwanders in among us, without any idea of their\r\nskills or origins.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Tomorrow we shall see if you can prove\nyourself worthy.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Oho! A most reasonable decision, Captain.\c\nNow, would you care to join us for a meal?\nI’m sure you’ve got plenty of questions for\r\nour visitor![VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s quite all right.\c\nI prefer to eat alone so I might appreciate my\nmeals without distraction.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Aloof as always, I see.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Well, no matter! The rest of us can share a meal\nand some pleasant conversation, then, eh?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Beni, old chum! The usual potato mochi, if you\nplease—but make it for three today![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 52]
Wonderful stuff, Beni! Much obliged.\nYour potato mochi never fail to please![VAR 0114(0005)]
Where’d you find this stranger in the first\nplace, Professor?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Professor Laventon, where exactly did you meet\nour...visitor here?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Ah, well, you know of that great hole in the sky?\nThe one people call the space-time rift?\r\nOur new friend fell right out of it![VAR 0114(0005)]
...Was that a joke?[VAR 0114(0006)]
You can’t be serious.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Come now—I am a scientist!\c\nMy job is to observe and explain any and all\nphenomena. I concern myself only with facts![VAR 0114(0005)]
Now, you already know there are many Pokémon\nhere in the [VAR FF00(0006)]Hisui region[VAR FF00(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Sure, they’re all over the place. In the grass, in\nthe forests, in the ocean...\c\nIt’s up to us in the Survey Corps to study them\nand figure out what kind of creatures they are.[VAR 0114(0006)]
That there are—in the grass, in forests, by water,\nor wherever they like.\c\nOur job as the Survey Corps is to research them\nand find out what kind of creatures they are![VAR 0114(0007)]
Well, we know this much...\c\nPokémon are terrifying creatures![VAR 0114(0005)]
It’s all but impossible to know what kinds of\npowers they might possess or what sorts of\r\nwondrous things they can do![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]But that’s where [VAR 0100(0000)] will\ncome in![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe successfully caught three Pokémon! Three of\nthem in quick order, you understand!\c\nNobody in the Galaxy Team is capable of a feat\nsuch as that. This means we can finally begin our\r\nPokémon research in earnest![VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s really something. We count ourselves lucky\nwhen we manage to catch a single wild Pokémon\r\nwhile fending off their attacks...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Three?! We have a hard enough time catching\neven one when wild Pokémon come after us...[VAR 0114(0007)]
Ah, well, to be perfectly fair, the Pokémon that\nfled to the beach weren’t on the attack.\c\nBut the key to catching Pokémon is getting close\nenough to aim your Poké Ball well. And it seems\r\nour new friend is fearless enough to do just that![VAR 0114(0005)]
Does the Survey Corps really have the leeway\nto be enjoying a leisurely meal with this outsider?[VAR 0114(000E)]
Your captain just ordered 10 whole portions of\npotato mochi, you know. The slow progress on\r\nthat Pokédex of yours clearly has her on edge.[VAR 0114(000E)]
[~ 72]
I’m sure we’ll start to rein in the good captain’s\nstress eating soon enough.\c\nNow, have your fill, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nAnd think! If you make it into the Galaxy Team,\nyou’ll never have to worry about a meal again.\c\nThe team provides for all its members’ needs—\neven if said members fell out of the sky![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 74]
That was quite delicious! Quite delicious indeed![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You’re awfully relaxed about all this.\nYou do know that we won’t get to have\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\njoin\r\nthe\r\nSurvey\r\nCorps\r\nunless\r\nshe\r\npasses\r\na trial?[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Yes, the food was lovely. But more importantly...\nyou do remember that [VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nhas a\r\ntrial to\r\npass\r\nto join\r\nthe Survey Corps,\r\ndon’t you?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Not to worry! I have complete confidence in\n[VAR 0100(0000)]’s skills.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Let’s hope it is not misplaced.[VAR 0114(0008)]
“[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)],” was it?\c\nFor tonight, at least, we will provide you with a\nplace to sleep. You may use our quarters there.[VAR 0114(0008)]
But if you fail to pass the trial we put to you\ntomorrow, you must move on.\c\nYou will be expelled from the village to meet\nyour fate—and perhaps your death—in the wilds.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Captain Cyllene’s like Hisui, in a way—they’re\nboth plenty harsh.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Captain Cyllene’s somewhat like Hisui, in that\nthey’re both quite harsh.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Now now, she simply puts on a stern front to help\nkeep us all safe.[VAR 0114(0005)]
At any rate, I think it’s time we turned in for the\nnight, eh?\c\nIt’s a good thing one can’t fall out of the futons\nwe sleep in here—I imagine our new friend has\r\nhad enough falling for one day!\c\nAnd with that, I bid you both a good night![VAR 0114(0005)]
Yeah, sleep tight![VAR 0114(0006)]
Still...people falling from the sky? That’s some\nkind of story.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Yes, good night.[VAR 0114(0007)]
A rift in the sky... People falling from it...\nThe world is full of mysteries.[VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 90]
The next day...
Hey in there! You awake? That was some wild\nlightning last night, right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Anyway, if you’re up, come on out![VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Good morning, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nAre\r\nyou\r\nup?\r\nQuite\r\nsome\r\nlightning\r\nlast\r\nnight,\r\nwasn’t it?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Today’s the day of your trial. So, er...let’s give it\nour all![VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 96]
Did you sleep all right? I know that’s not easy in\na strange new land.[VAR 0114(0006)]
We’d better not keep Captain Cyllene waiting.\nLet’s hurry to headquarters![VAR 0114(0006)]
What lovely weather we’ve got!\c\nI hope you had a nice sleep, even if this land is\nstrange and new to you.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Let’s get to headquarters. Captain Cyllene\nis waiting.[VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 101]
Here we are—Galaxy Hall! What d’you think?\nEver seen a building this grand before?[VAR 0114(0006)]
The Survey Corps’ offices are here on the\nfirst fl—[VAR 0114(0007)]
Don’t give up! Keep those eyes open![VAR 0114(0020)]
The wild Pokémon, they...they were everywhere.\nAttacking from all sides...\c\nI sent out my partner Pokémon, but...against a\nwhole pack... Outnumbered...[VAR 0114(009C)]
This is what happens when you go so far afield!\nBut the Medical Corps will put you to rights.[VAR 0114(0020)]
You, uh...do realize that if you fail your trial and\nget flung out of the village, you could well die\r\nout there?\c\nWell, you might die even sooner than that if you\nhave to take on this trial without a Pokémon to\r\nbe your partner...[VAR 0114(0006)]
That man’s with the Security Corps...and even\nwith his own partner, he took a beating from\r\nwild Pokémon.\c\nWithout a partner Pokémon of your own, you\nmight find this trial...particularly trying.[VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 109]
Captain Cyllene, ma’am!\nI’ve brought [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Captain Cyllene? [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]\nis here.[VAR 0114(0007)]
You may enter.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 113]
Let us get straight to it.[VAR 0114(0008)]
If you wish to join the Galaxy Expedition Team,\nprove yourself capable by going out into the\r\nObsidian Fieldlands and catching three different\r\nspecies of Pokémon: Bidoof, Starly, and Shinx.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Three species, right away?! But none of us have\never managed that![VAR 0114(0006)]
Catching three Pokémon from the start? No one\nin the Galaxy Team has ever managed that...[VAR 0114(0007)]
Did this stranger not catch three different\nPokémon only yesterday?\c\nMy trial should be simple enough for h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer—if the\nprofessor wasn’t exaggerating things, that is.[VAR 0114(0008)]
The Galaxy Team does not have the means to\nprovide for those who only take without giving.\c\nIf you wish to stay, you must prove beyond any\ndoubt that you’ll be an asset to our cause.[VAR 0114(0008)]
I will lend you one of our Survey Corps satchels\nto carry whatever you may need in the field.[VAR 0114(0008)]
That whatever-it-is you’re wearing doesn’t suit\nour satchels in the least![VAR 0114(0006)]
That satchel doesn’t exactly match your, er,\nmode of dress...[VAR 0114(0007)]
Rei.\c\nI’ll expect you to step in if anything goes awry.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Akari.\c\nI’ll expect you to step in if anything goes awry.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Pardon, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Come with\nme a moment![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 126]
Now then, a jolly good morning to everyone![VAR 0114(0005)]
What did you need, Professor?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Is something the matter, Professor Laventon?[VAR 0114(0007)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]In order to complete our Pokédex and, well,\nsimply survive in this unforgiving land...\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)] absolutely must pass\nthis trial![VAR 0114(0005)]
And as a professor of Pokémon, I’ve got just the\nticket to help accomplish that![VAR 0114(0005)]
Krooo!
Fooom!
Plish plash!
[VAR BD06(0000)]Go on, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Pick the\nPokémon\r\nthat\r\nstrikes\r\nyour fancy!\c\nWith a partner of your own, you’ll be able to\nfight off wild Pokémon outside the village![VAR 0114(0005)]
These little darlings are very dear to me...but it’s\nplain to see they’re rather curious about you![VAR 0114(0005)]
Well, my [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl? Which Pokémon would you like to\nkeep as your very own?[VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 138]
Krooo!
Fooom!
Plish plash!
[VAR BD06(0000)]Do you want [VAR 0101(0001)] as your\nfirst partner?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Why not just choose whichever one your gut tells\nyou to?[VAR 0114(0006)]
They’re all so lovely...[VAR 0114(0007)]
You know what is expected of you. Now it is up\nto you to see things through.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 146]
[VAR BD06(0000)]And with that, one of the Pokémon you caught at\nPrelude Beach for me will now be yours to keep!\c\nGood show! I’ve tucked [VAR 0101(0001)] back\ninside\r\nits\r\nPoké Ball for you, so take it—it’s yours![VAR 0114(0005)]
A word of advice, my [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl—pay close attention\nto which Poké Balls are empty and which ones\r\ncontain a Pokémon when you’re out in the field![VAR 0114(0005)]
Kooo kooo!
Fooom!
Plashhh!
[VAR BD06(0000)]Look at those two cheer on their\npal [VAR 0101(0001)].[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Or maybe they just wanted to help\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nwith\r\nher trial![VAR 0114(0006)]
They look as if they’re cheering on their\nfriend [VAR 0101(0001)].[VAR 0114(0007)]
Or perhaps they’re jealous that it gets to help\nyou with your trial![VAR 0114(0007)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]That could well be... They did go dashing from\nthe village when [VAR 0100(0000)] fell\r\nout\r\nof\r\nthe\r\nsky,\r\nafter all.\c\nWell, not to worry, you two! I’ll have you assist\nme with my research for now![VAR 0114(0005)]
Krooo.
Fooom.
Plish plash.
By the by, what species has Captain Cyllene\ncharged you with catching?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Well, that’s smashing! All three of those species\ncan be found in the Obsidian Fieldlands![VAR 0114(0005)]
Let me give you some Poké Balls to use during\nyour trial, then.[VAR 0114(0005)]
These Poké Balls may be handcrafted, but they\nwork a treat, as you’ve already seen![VAR 0114(0005)]
You’ll have this trial cleared in no time![VAR 0114(0005)]
Let’s be off!\c\nI’ll show you the way to the Obsidian Fieldlands.\nMeet me at the gate to your left as you\r\nleave headquarters.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I guess you’re finally ready!\c\nYou’ll have to leave the village for your trial.\nTurn left after you exit headquarters, then head\r\nfor the gate.[VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 167]
Oh? What a curious getup you have there.\nI can already tell you’re quite the character![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’m Volo of the Ginkgo Guild, the go-to choice\nfor any of your mercantile needs here in Hisui![VAR 0114(000C)]
I’ve heard talk about you. Fell from the sky,\ndidn’t you? Now that’s certainly a tale I’d like\r\nto hear...[VAR 0114(000C)]
Oh, and you’ve a Pokémon!\nYou’re certainly full of interesting surprises...[VAR 0114(000C)]
Investigating the odd and novel is key to any\ngood merchant’s success! So what do you say?\c\nHow about you and I see how our Pokémon\nstand up to one another in battle?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Sounds good
Maybe not...
I like you better and better! What a delightful\nfind![VAR 0114(000C)]
But what’s the point of having a Pokémon, then?\nCome on, now—it’s just a friendly competition![VAR 0114(000C)]
I’ve also heard about this trial you’re to attempt.\c\nLet’s have a quick battle to get your blood\npumping before you head out!\c\nThough I hope you know you’ll lose if your\nPokémon’s HP reaches zero![VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 178]
It’s always good fun to have your Pokémon do\nbattle, don’t you think?\c\nAnd as they gain experience through battle,\nthey’ll learn more moves and grow even stronger![VAR 0114(000C)]
But so few people here have their own Pokémon.\nIf only more knew how to use Poké Balls![VAR 0114(000C)]
At any rate, let me help our two battlers recover\nfrom their little exercise.[VAR 0114(000C)]
And to you, my sky-fallen friend...I present some\nPotions in thanks![VAR 0114(000C)]
You can use them on your Pokémon whenever\nthey might be worn out from battle.\c\nI’ll be hoping that you’re successful on that trial\nof yours.\c\nMore Galaxy Team members means more\ncustomers for yours truly, after all![VAR 0114(000C)]
If you can battle that well, I’ve got a feeling you\nmay have your trial well in hand—even if it’s\r\nmore to do with catching than battling.[VAR 0114(0006)]
That’s really something! Not only can you catch\nPokémon—you can lead them in battle![VAR 0114(0007)]
Now, to the Obsidian Fieldlands![VAR 0114(0006)]
Now, to the Obsidian Fieldlands![VAR 0114(0007)]
Whenever you leave Jubilife Village, you have to\npick a destination from your map and let Ress the\r\nguardsman know where you’re off to.[VAR 0114(0006)]
That way, someone can come collect you if things\ngo wrong.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Hey...I hope you make it through this![VAR 0114(0006)]
When you’re leaving Jubilife Village, make sure\nyou choose a destination from your map and tell\r\nRess the guardsman where you’re going.[VAR 0114(0007)]
That way, someone can come to your aid if\nyou’re knocked out by a Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Your trial begins just a short way past that\nfront gate![VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 194]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You’re [VAR 0100(0000)], correct? I was\ninformed\r\nyou’d\r\nbe\r\npassing through.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Your trial will take place outside the safety of the\nvillage. Please take care to come back alive.[VAR 0114(0030)]
[~ 197]
This is our base camp. It’s where we start and\nfinish our surveys.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Now remember what you’ve got to do.\c\nYou’ve been tasked with catching three species\nof Pokémon: Bidoof, Starly, and Shinx![VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m curious to see if the professor’s stories about\nyou are really true.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh, Professor? Something wrong?[VAR 0114(0006)]
This is our base camp—the last safe haven before\nyou reach the wilds.[VAR 0114(0007)]
For your trial, you must catch three species of\nPokémon: Bidoof, Starly, and Shinx![VAR 0114(0007)]
Are you ready to get started?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Oh, Professor? Is something wrong?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Ah, well, you see...\c\nCaptain Cyllene got hold of me after you left...\c\nShe impressed upon me that I bear full\nresponsibility for whatever happens to\r\n“our sudden guest.”[VAR 0114(0005)]
She doesn’t let up. How exactly are you\nsupposed to help out here, Professor?[VAR 0114(0006)]
That’s our unsparing captain. But what help\nexactly can you offer out here, Professor?[VAR 0114(0007)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]To be honest, my dear [VAR 1100(00FF,0304)]girlboy, I don’t intend to lift\na finger! [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]’s talents are\r\nthe\r\nreal deal.\r\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe’ll pass with flying colors—you’ll see![VAR 0114(0005)]
So in other words, I’m still the one bearing the\nresponsibility here? Not my ideal state of affairs.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Let’s just get started. You’ll be more than equal\nto this, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
Ah. So the responsibility for him still lies, in fact,\nwith me, then.[VAR 0114(0007)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Well, I’m sure [VAR 0100(0000)] will be\nfine.\r\nLet’s\r\nbegin\r\nthe trial![VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 214]
Where are you even going?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Are you sure you know where you’re going?[VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 217]
This is Aspiration Hill.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Look—a Bidoof! We’re finding the Pokémon you\nneed already![VAR 0114(0006)]
You may be some sort of prodigy, but just in\ncase, here’s what Captain Cyllene taught me...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Bidoof is a mellow Pokémon, which means it\ndoesn’t tend to run away when you approach.\c\nAim carefully, let your Poké Ball fly, and you\nought to be all right.[VAR 0114(0006)]
If you want to pass this trial, you’ll have to start\nby throwing a Poké Ball at a Bidoof![VAR 0114(0006)]
What good is it to defeat the Bidoof? You’re\nmeant to catch it![VAR 0114(0006)]
Hey! Wherever you’re trying to go, it can wait till\nyou’ve got a Bidoof![VAR 0114(0006)]
This is Aspiration Hill. The species of Pokémon\nyou’re meant to catch all live here.[VAR 0114(0007)]
And along comes a Bidoof! Time to get ready to\ncatch it.[VAR 0114(0007)]
The key is to aim carefully. Not that you seem to\nneed my advice—I’m just sharing what I know.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Bidoof has a mellow disposition. That means it\ntends not to run from people, so this’ll be easy![VAR 0114(0007)]
You ought to be able to catch a Bidoof with a\nwell-thrown Poké Ball.[VAR 0114(0007)]
I think you were tasked with catching a Bidoof,\nnot defeating it...[VAR 0114(0007)]
Excuse me! You’ve a Bidoof to catch![VAR 0114(0007)]
You’re out of Poké Balls? Come on—aim before\nyou throw![VAR 0114(0006)]
Run dry of Poké Balls? Here, I’ve got some extra.\nGood luck![VAR 0114(0007)]
If Pokémon start launching attacks at you, run to\nsafety as quickly as you can, all right, my [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl?[VAR 0114(0005)]
The point of your trial’s to catch ’em, remember?\nDon’t get too caught up with battling ’em.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Don’t forget that your objective is to catch them.\nLosing battles to them won’t get you anywhere.[VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 237]
One Bidoof—caught! Now, on we march![VAR 0114(0006)]
You caught a Bidoof! Well done! Time to find\nyour next Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 240]
Now, Starly here—it’s the type to run at the drop\nof a hat.[VAR 0114(0006)]
But not to worry! Crouch down in the grass, and\nit won’t spot you. That’s how you can get close![VAR 0114(0006)]
That’s a shame... The Starly got away from\nyou, eh?\c\nThey’re quite skittish. It’s hard to catch one once\nit’s spotted you.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Look, another Starly! You’ll need to crouch so it\ndoesn’t notice you.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Crouching makes it harder for wild Pokémon to\nnotice you, even out in the open![VAR 0114(0006)]
This is supposed to be a trial to CATCH a Starly,\nyou know.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Hey! Wherever you’re trying to go, it can wait till\nyou’ve got a Starly![VAR 0114(0006)]
There’s a Starly. They’re skittish little things—\nthey’ll run if startled.[VAR 0114(0007)]
But you should be able to get close to them if\nyou crouch—you’ll be harder to spot![VAR 0114(0007)]
Well, that’s a shame. Wave good-bye to that\nStarly, I suppose.\c\nAs I said, they’re skittish. If one spots you, you’ll\nhave a tough time catching it.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Look! Another Starly. Crouch down before it\nspots you![VAR 0114(0007)]
Crouching makes it harder for wild Pokémon\nto spot you, even outside tall grass.[VAR 0114(0007)]
I think you were tasked with catching Starly, not\nbattling it...[VAR 0114(0007)]
Excuse me—you’ve a Starly to catch...[VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 255]
And that’s Starly caught, too! I admit, I’m\nimpressed so far.[VAR 0114(0006)]
That’s Starly caught as well! Only one more\nPokémon to go.[VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 258]
I forgot to share another smidgen of wisdom...[VAR 0114(0006)]
How to throw your partner’s Poké Ball![VAR 0114(0006)]
To quote Captain Cyllene’s wise teachings...\c\n“Have an item at the ready but want to send out\na Pokémon? Press X.”\c\n“Have a Pokémon at the ready but want to throw\nan item? Press X.”\c\nThe captain’s a real expert on these things.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Then once you’ve got a Pokémon ready, try\naiming for certain rocks—or trees like this one.\c\nYour Pokémon will hunt for Berries and things,\nand it’ll bring back whatever it finds![VAR 0114(0006)]
Now it’s time for your partner[VAR 1101(00FD,0100)]s to shine.\c\nWe’ve reached your final hurdle: catching\na Shinx.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I forgot—there’s something I ought to teach you,\nsince you’re still new to this![VAR 0114(0007)]
Here’s the proper way to throw your partner’s\nPoké Ball.[VAR 0114(0007)]
As Captain Cyllene tells us...\c\n“Have an item at the ready but want to send out\na Pokémon? Press X.”\c\n“Have a Pokémon at the ready but want to throw\nan item? Press X.”\c\nThe captain’s a real expert on these things.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Try throwing your Pokémon’s ball at rocks—or\ntrees like this one—to have it investigate.\c\nIf your Pokémon finds any Berries or other items,\nit’ll bring them to you![VAR 0114(0007)]
Now it’s time for your partner[VAR 1101(00FD,0100)]s to shine.\c\nWe’ve reached your final hurdle: catching\na Shinx.[VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 269]
There it is. Shinx.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Shinx has an aggressive disposition... Did you\nknow that already?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Yep!
It has what?
That figures! Me, I have to focus on a Pokémon\ncarefully to notice a thing like that.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Don’t worry about it! Just focus on the Pokémon\naround you—you’ll figure it out quick enough.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Once aggressive Pokémon get wound up, they’ll\nknock away any balls you throw.[VAR 0114(0006)]
But not to worry! I’ll teach you the trick to\ncatching them.[VAR 0114(0006)]
You draw them into battle!\c\nOnce it’s caught up in the heat of battle, you can\nthrow a Poké Ball to try and catch it![VAR 0114(0006)]
You’ve got a few Pokémon of your own to use\nnow, don’t you?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Take one of their Poké Balls, and throw it at a\nwild Pokémon you want to battle![VAR 0114(0006)]
Use what you learned in your battle with Volo!\nGet out there, and make your last catch![VAR 0114(0006)]
Don’t get so caught up in battle yourself that you\nforget to throw a Poké Ball and catch it![VAR 0114(0006)]
You can’t knock the Shinx out if you want to\ncatch it.\c\nEven in battle, catching works the same—choose\nan empty Poké Ball from your satchel and throw![VAR 0114(0006)]
Hey! Wherever you’re trying to go, it can wait till\nyou’ve got a Shinx![VAR 0114(0006)]
There. That’s Shinx.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Shinx has an aggressive disposition. Could you\nalready tell that?[VAR 0114(0007)]
More or less[VAR 0114(0007)]
Not at all[VAR 0114(0007)]
I thought you might! I can never tell until I focus\non a Pokémon carefully.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Not to worry! These things become clear once\nyou focus on the Pokémon around you.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Once aggressive Pokémon get irate, they’ll knock\naside any ball you throw at them.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Don’t worry, though! I’ll teach you the trick to\ncatching aggressive Pokémon![VAR 0114(0007)]
You’ve got to battle them!\c\nOnce they’re absorbed with battling, you can\nthrow a Poké Ball at them to try to catch them![VAR 0114(0007)]
By now, you’ve got several Pokémon of your\nown, don’t you?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Take one of their Poké Balls and throw it near a\nwild Pokémon you want to battle.[VAR 0114(0007)]
I’ve got no doubt you’ll hold your own in battle![VAR 0114(0007)]
Just don’t lose yourself in battle and forget to\nthrow a Poké Ball at all![VAR 0114(0007)]
No, no! Don’t knock the Shinx out—catch it!\c\nEven in battle, you can throw an empty Poké Ball\nat it, like you would any other time.[VAR 0114(0007)]
What? No, don’t leave! You have to catch\na Shinx![VAR 0114(0007)]
I know you want to weaken Shinx to catch it, but\ngetting your partner knocked out won’t help![VAR 0114(0006)]
You’re on the right track, using your partner’s\nmoves to weaken Shinx before catching it...but\r\nyou mustn’t let your Pokémon get knocked out![VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 302]
Wait—did you really...? You really did! You did it!\c\nThat’s three species of Pokémon—caught!\nYou really are some kind of prodigy![VAR 0114(0006)]
You approached those Pokémon without a hint\nof fear...and caught each one!\c\nYou’re like a gift the sky dropped to us![VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 305]
You must’ve given Professor Laventon the shock\nof his life.\c\nFirst you fall from the sky, then you go and catch\nall of our escaped Pokémon, one after another![VAR 0114(0006)]
I honestly didn’t believe the professor’s story\nuntil I saw you in action for myself.[VAR 0114(0006)]
And here you are with three Pokémon caught!\nYou’ve completed your trial![VAR 0114(0006)]
With you at our side, I think the Survey Corps\nhas a real chance of compiling a complete\r\nPokédex as we’ve been ordered![VAR 0114(0007)]
This is wonderful!\c\nI’m still curious why on earth you came falling\nfrom the sky like you did...but for now, let’s tell\r\nthe professor we’re ready to head back![VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 311]
Oho! I said you’d pass the trial with flying colors,\nand it seems you went and did just that![VAR 0114(0005)]
Congratulations, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nYou’ve taken your first step toward seeking out\nevery Pokémon!\c\nThis calls for a commemorative photograph.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ve got to admit, it’s true—you’ve got real talent\nfor this![VAR 0114(0006)]
With skills like yours, I suppose this was a\nforegone conclusion![VAR 0114(0007)]
Now then, we’d best report to Captain Cyllene.\nTime to head back to Jubilife Village, eh?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Let’s not keep Professor Laventon waiting![VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m sure the professor will be overjoyed.[VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 319]
Eventually, you should be able to have Pokémon\nyou’ve caught go live in the village pastures.[VAR 0114(0006)]
The most Pokémon a person can have with them\nwhile out exploring is six, apparently... Not that\r\nwe have anyone who can manage that![VAR 0114(0006)]
In time, you’ll be able to send Pokémon you’ve\ncaught to live in the village pastures.[VAR 0114(0007)]
You can bring up to six Pokémon with you into\nthe field, in theory.\c\nThough we’ve never had anyone skilled enough\nto do so![VAR 0114(0007)]
Come now, you two—let’s not dillydally! Captain\nCyllene awaits our report at headquarters.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I can’t wait to see the captain’s reaction.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I bet Captain Cyllene will be very pleased.[VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 327]
It seems we won’t have to leave you to die,\nafter all.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Congratulations.\c\nYou’ve passed your trial. You can hold on to\nthat satchel.[VAR 0114(0008)]
I must admit you’ve impressed me.\c\nI set a high hurdle to judge whether a stranger\nlike yourself could be worthy, but you cleared it.[VAR 0114(0008)]
This is yours—the official uniform of the\nSurvey Corps.[VAR 0114(0008)]
You received a [VAR FF00(0008)]Survey Corps Uniform[VAR FF00(0000)] and a pair\nof [VAR FF00(0008)]Survey Corps Sandals[VAR FF00(0000)]!
Get changed in the room you used last night.\nThen you’re to report at once to the third floor.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Present yourself in uniform to our commander.\nThis is your first official order from your captain![VAR 0114(0008)]
We’ve a great deal of survey work ahead of us,\nmy [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl! I hope you’re ready![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 336]
Look at you, in the Survey Corps uniform. Now it\nfinally feels like you’re one of us!\c\nBut I do wonder when the captain decided to go\nahead and get a uniform ready for you...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Look how well our Survey Corps uniform\nsuits you!\c\nIt’s almost as if the captain had it tailored just\nfor you.[VAR 0114(0007)]
I see you’ve changed.\c\nRegarding your accommodations, you may\ncontinue to use the room you slept in last night.[VAR 0114(0008)]
You may wear this as well.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Now present yourself to the commander![VAR 0114(0008)]
Go change into your uniform. Use the mirror in\nyour quarters to make sure you put it on right![VAR 0114(0006)]
Remember, the commander’s room is on the\nthird floor![VAR 0114(0006)]
If you go up there not in uniform, the commander\nwill send you flying![VAR 0114(0006)]
When you’re ready to get into your uniform,\nmake sure to use the mirror in your quarters.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Our commander’s room is on the third floor\nof headquarters.[VAR 0114(0007)]
You’d better wear your uniform if you don’t want\nthe commander to sumo throw you out the door![VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 348]
Do you want to change your outfit?
Time to put on your [VAR FF00(0008)]Survey Corps Uniform[VAR FF00(0000)] and\nyour [VAR FF00(0008)]Survey Corps Sandals[VAR FF00(0000)].
You need to put on your [VAR FF00(0008)]Survey Corps Uniform[VAR FF00(0000)]\nand your [VAR FF00(0008)]Survey Corps Sandals[VAR FF00(0000)].
You changed into your Survey Corps uniform!
[~ 353]
I have been waiting for you!
I am Kamado, commander of the Galaxy\nExpedition Team![VAR 0114(0009)]
Hrrrm... So, you are [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0009)]
Yes, sir!
It’s an honor
Uh...
Hrrrm![VAR 0114(0009)]
You know your manners, at least.[VAR 0114(0009)]
A simple yes or no will do.[VAR 0114(0009)]
I’ve been briefed on your situation—including\nhow you fell from the rift in the sky.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Now then... Let’s see what you’re made of![VAR 0114(0009)]
Face me in combat![VAR 0114(0009)]
Try to throw him
Charge at him
Hyah![VAR 0114(0009)]
Hrrrm! You’ve got some fight in you!\c\nYour sumo needs work, but I do see\nsome potential...[VAR 0114(0009)]
Hrrrm! You’ve got vigor—I’ll give you that!\c\nYou need to work on your sumo technique, but I\ndo see some potential...[VAR 0114(0009)]
Don’t expect a warm welcome from everyone!\nNaturally, some will be slow to trust an outsider\r\nwho literally fell right out of the blue.\c\nThe superstitious among us might see your arrival\nas a portent of disaster![VAR 0114(0009)]
But you passed the trial that was put to you.\c\nNo matter how odd you may seem, you’re part\nof Jubilife Village now.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Dedicate yourself to the work of the Galaxy\nExpedition Team, and complete the Pokédex![VAR 0114(0009)]
But I warn you, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nPokémon are terrifying creatures. Keep your wits\nabout you as you work![VAR 0114(0009)]
[~ 375]
So the commander has also accepted you.[VAR 0114(0008)]
But understand this... You begin as a [VAR FF00(0006)]No Star[VAR FF00(0000)]\nrecruit among our ranks. In other words, you have\r\nno rank at all.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Perform well as a member of the Survey Corps,\nand you will move up through the ranks.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Indeed! You see, the more you add to the\nPokédex, the higher your rank will become.\c\nAnd working on the Pokédex will also, of course,\nbring you closer toward that goal of yours...\r\nto seek out every last Pokémon![VAR 0114(0005)]
Here. You will need this.[VAR 0114(0008)]
And 3,000 as well. You will have to buy the\nnecessary materials.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Rei. You are an expert at crafting, yourself.\nTeach our new recruit what she needs to know.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Akari. You are an expert at crafting, yourself.\nTeach our new recruit what he needs to know.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Yes, ma’am, Captain.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Of course, Captain Cyllene.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Get ready for a lesson in crafting![VAR 0114(0006)]
Crafting means making items from scratch!\c\nThat’s right—whatever you need in your survey\nwork, you’ll mostly make yourself.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Some things you can buy at the general store.\nBut it’s good to try to be self-sufficient.[VAR 0114(0006)]
This way, we can even catch Pokémon with Poké\nBalls we’ve crafted ourselves![VAR 0114(0006)]
But listen to me prattle on. Let’s go to the\ncraftworks so you can try it yourself![VAR 0114(0006)]
Now, as the experienced craftsperson here,\nlet me explain a bit to start with.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Crafting means making items with your own\ntwo hands.[VAR 0114(0007)]
You can buy some items at the general store,\nbut self-sufficiency is worth striving for![VAR 0114(0007)]
You can even make our most valuable tools: Poké\nBalls. Think where we’d be if we couldn’t do that![VAR 0114(0007)]
Let’s head to the craftworks.[VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 396]
Well done earning a place in our team.\c\nMy name is Anthe. I’m the local clothier.[VAR 0114(001D)]
The professor asked that I ready you a change\nof clothes, so here you go! I do hope they fit.[VAR 0114(001D)]
You received an [VAR FF00(0008)]Everyday Kimono[VAR FF00(0000)] and a pair\nof [VAR FF00(0008)]Everyday Trousers[VAR FF00(0000)]!
I hope you’ll avail yourself of the village’s\nhumble shops![VAR 0114(001D)]
[~ 401]
Hey, hey! This way to the craftworks![VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]This way to the craftworks,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0007)]
This here’s the craftworks, and that there is the\nworkbench. It’s where you craft things.\c\nPretty self-explanatory, right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
When you step up to the workbench, I’ll supply\nyou materials to make some Poké Balls. Call it a\r\npresent to celebrate passing your trial!\c\nAnd as for the money the captain gave you, feel\nfree to spend that however you like.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Any recipes you get should tell you what\nmaterials you need to complete them.[VAR 0114(0006)]
At the workbench, just choose what you want to\nmake, and get crafting. Go on—try it out![VAR 0114(0006)]
You can use the workbench here at the craftworks\nanytime you need to make an item in the village.[VAR 0114(0007)]
And I’ll supply what you need to make your first\nPoké Balls once you’re ready to begin. Call it my\r\nway of saying congratulations on joining us!\c\nJust spend the money you got from the captain\non clothes—or whatever you think is best.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Go up to the workbench, and choose an item\nto craft—in this case, a Poké Ball![VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 411]
Oho! Now that’s some fine craftsmanship! Hard\nto believe this was your first time stepping up to\r\nthe workbench, my [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl![VAR 0114(0005)]
You’ll recall, of course, that Pokémon possess\nthe odd power to shrink themselves down.\c\nWith the Poké Balls we craft, we can make use of\nthat power to catch them![VAR 0114(0005)]
All so that more Pokémon species can be duly\nrecorded in a Pokédex.\c\nAnd on that note, here you are![VAR 0114(0005)]
You received a [VAR FF00(0008)]Pokédex[VAR FF00(0000)]!
I prepared this volume just for you!\c\nI hope it aids you well in your aim to seek out all\nthe Pokémon there are in this grand region![VAR 0114(0005)]
It’ll take plenty of [VAR FF00(0006)]research tasks[VAR FF00(0000)] to help the\nprofessor complete the Pokédex.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ve got to get going on those myself.[VAR 0114(0006)]
You’ll have to complete lots of [VAR FF00(0006)]research tasks[VAR FF00(0000)] to\nhelp the professor fill out the Pokédex.[VAR 0114(0007)]
The same goes for me, of course. I’ve also got\nPokémon to research, as a Survey Corps member.[VAR 0114(0007)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I’d be all too happy to explain more about the\nresearch tasks I could use your assistance with.\c\nCome join me at the Fieldlands Camp whenever\nyou are ready, my good\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hey, excuse me—I couldn’t help but overhear...\c\nIf you’re going to the Fieldlands Camp, would\nyou mind taking care of a request for me?[VAR 0114(002A)]
I’m standing guard, so I can’t leave my post,\nbut I’ll be here at headquarters if you want to\r\ntalk about it.[VAR 0114(002A)]
[~ 424]
Righto. Let’s get to it, then, shall we?\c\nIn order to complete this Pokédex of ours, there\nare a great many research tasks I’ll need your\r\nhelp to carry out, my [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl.[VAR 0114(0005)]
The details of these tasks can be found in the\nPokédex for you to reference anytime.[VAR 0114(0005)]
You must catch and battle diverse Pokémon\nspecies and carry out plenty of research tasks.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Do so, and you’ll gain research points and other\nrewards for your work![VAR 0114(0005)]
Now, there’s one more nugget of wisdom I’ve got\nto share, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nWild Pokémon may attack you at any time. When\nthey do...dodge like your life depends on it![VAR 0114(0006)]
Dodge?
Come again?
Look—just watch me, would you? Then you’ll be\nable to copy what I do![VAR 0114(0006)]
Here I go![VAR 0114(0006)]
See? That’s how you dodge![VAR 0114(0006)]
A timely dodge will keep you from getting hurt\nby the fierce attacks of wild Pokémon!\c\nAnd that’s key if you’d rather not end up blacked\nout in some field like I did...[VAR 0114(0006)]
When those Shinx got me with Thunder Shock,\nI might’ve been done for if the Security Corps\r\nhadn’t come and saved me...[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]One last piece of advice,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nIf you see a wild Pokémon’s attack coming your\nway...dodge like your life depends on it![VAR 0114(0007)]
Dodge?
Say again?
Here—watch closely, and remember what I do so\nyou can do it later.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Hup![VAR 0114(0007)]
That beautiful, flowing bit of gymnastics is what\nwe call a dodge![VAR 0114(0007)]
If you’re light on your feet, you can dodge out\nof the way of wild Pokémon’s attacks.\c\nThat way, hopefully you can avoid taking a\nbeating and blacking out in the wilderness.[VAR 0114(0007)]
The Security Corps had to collect me when I...got\nthe business end of some Shinx’s Thunder Shock.[VAR 0114(0007)]
But hey, no need to worry—you’ve got me here\nto give you tips! I’ll teach you plenty.[VAR 0114(0006)]
But don’t you worry! I’ve got lots of experience\nto draw on, and I’ll teach you plenty![VAR 0114(0007)]
Research tasks aren’t simply about catching\nPokémon—they’ll require you to carry out all\r\nsorts of exciting fieldwork!\c\nFor now, I suggest you listen to Rei’s advice.\nYou’ll find everything much clearer with his help.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Research tasks aren’t simply about catching\nPokémon—they’ll require you to carry out all\r\nsorts of exciting fieldwork!\c\nFor now, I suggest you listen to Akari’s advice.\nYou’ll find everything much clearer with her help.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Or would you rather return to Jubilife Village?[VAR 0114(0005)]
A wise decision, my [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl! One can never be too\nprepared for an expedition outside the village.\r\nGet your affairs sorted and meet us back here.[VAR 0114(0005)]
As you wish. Best of luck carrying out your\nresearch tasks out there![VAR 0114(0005)]
If you want to raise your rank within the Galaxy\nTeam, you’ll need to carry out research tasks.\c\nLook at the Pokédex pages of the Pokémon you\ncatch to check the tasks for their species, then\r\ncross them off the list to earn research points.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 453]
Get ready for some Survey Corps wisdom!\c\n“Focus on a Pokémon with the ZL Button, then\npress the Down Button to open the Pokédex.”\r\nYou’ll see what tasks you have for that Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Did you see that your research tasks for Bidoof\ninclude one about how many you’ve caught?\c\nThat’s right—catching just one won’t do it. You’ve\ngot to get two, then four...then more and more![VAR 0114(0006)]
And when it’s time to battle a Pokémon...\c\nRemember the captain’s switching wisdom! If you\nhave items out, press X to ready your Pokémon!\c\nGive it a try now, if you want. I’ll go on ahead.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Now, let me share some Survey Corps wisdom!\c\n“Focus on a Pokémon with the ZL Button, then\npress the Down Button to open the Pokédex.”\r\nYou’ll see what tasks you have for that Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0007)]
You might’ve noticed that you have a research\ntask to do with how many Bidoof you’ve caught.\c\nThat’s right—catching just one isn’t enough.\nYou need two, then four...then more and more![VAR 0114(0007)]
And when it’s time to battle a Pokémon...\c\nRemember the captain’s switching wisdom! If you\nhave items out, press X to ready your Pokémon!\c\nGive it a try now, if you want. I’ll go on ahead.[VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 460]
I know I’m laying it on thick, but don’t forget to\nopen your Pokédex when you focus on a\r\nPokémon to check your research tasks for it.\c\nYou just hold ZL and press Down! Try checking\nyour tasks for Starly next.[VAR 0114(0006)]
One of your tasks is to catch Starly without being\nspotted, right?\c\nYou can get that done if you hide in some tall\ngrass to catch ’em. Give it a try![VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ll go wait for you up ahead. Come catch up\nonce you’ve finished some tasks.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I think you’ve got it, but as a reminder: don’t\nforget to open your Pokédex when you focus on\r\non a Pokémon to check your research tasks for it!\c\nIt’s just ZL, then Down! Try checking your tasks\nfor Starly next.[VAR 0114(0007)]
One of your tasks is to catch Starly without being\nspotted, right?\c\nFor that task, try catching them while hiding in\nsome tall grass.[VAR 0114(0007)]
I’ll go wait for you up ahead. Come catch up\nonce you’ve finished some tasks.[VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 467]
Around here, you can find a Pokémon called\nBuizel. It’s got an aggressive disposition.[VAR 0114(0006)]
That means it’ll try to hit you with its moves, just\nlike Shinx, and you’ll need to battle it to catch it.[VAR 0114(0006)]
And speaking of which, your research tasks for\nBuizel include seeing it use a certain move.\c\nYou gotta see the move in battle for it to count\ntoward that task. So battling is extra key here![VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m going on ahead. Come catch up once you’ve\nchecked off some of Buizel’s tasks.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Around here, you can find a Pokémon called\nBuizel. It’s got an aggressive disposition.[VAR 0114(0007)]

And speaking of which, your research tasks for\nBuizel include seeing it use a certain move.\c\nTo be precise, you have to see it use the move in\nbattle. That’s right—some tasks require battling![VAR 0114(0007)]
Now, I’ll go on ahead. You take care of some of\nBuizel’s research tasks, then come talk to me.[VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 476]
You’re doing pretty well for a mystery stranger\nfrom the sky.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Here! A little reward for keeping up with me:\nyour own Crafting Kit![VAR 0114(0006)]
And here’s a recipe for Potions, too.[VAR 0114(0006)]
With a Crafting Kit, you can craft items anywhere\nusing whatever materials are in your satchel!\c\nSo long as you’ve got an Apricorn and a\nTumblestone, you can make a Poké Ball anytime.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Or with an Oran Berry and a Medicinal Leek, you\ncan whip up a Potion—so heal up your Pokémon\r\nwhenever they need healing![VAR 0114(0006)]
Research going all right? You can see if you’ve\ngot tasks ready to turn in on the Pokédex’s cover.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Once you’ve got some tasks good and done, go\ncheck in with Professor Laventon! See you soon![VAR 0114(0006)]
You’re really doing quite well for yourself![VAR 0114(0007)]
Here! A little reward for keeping up with me:\nyour own Crafting Kit![VAR 0114(0007)]

How goes your research?\c\nThe cover of your Pokédex will tell you if there\nare tasks you’ve finished and can report.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Please report back to Professor Laventon once\nyou’ve got some research tasks good and done.[VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 491]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You’ve made good progress on these research\ntasks, [VAR 0100(0000)]. I do believe\r\nyou’re\r\nready to\r\nmove up\r\nthe ranks![VAR 0114(0005)]
Let’s head back to the village and report the\ngood news to Captain Cyllene. It’s time you\r\nearned yourself a star![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oho! If it isn’t a Crafting Kit!\c\nYou must have listened attentively to Rei’s\nteachings. Excellent work, dear girl![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oho! If it isn’t a Crafting Kit!\c\nYou must have listened attentively to Akari’s\nteachings. Excellent work, dear boy![VAR 0114(0005)]
This seems a good time to explain to you about\nsurvey reports and the rewards they offer.[VAR 0114(0005)]
On that note, let me check the research tasks\nyou’ve completed thus far.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Ah, not quite there yet, I’m afraid! You’ll need\nto complete a few more research tasks before\r\nyou’re ready to go up a rank.\c\nI’d recommend you work your way through\nBidoof’s and Starly’s tasks first. Hang in there![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 499]
That a stranger like you should fall from the sky\nand yet flourish among us like this is a testament\r\nto your native talent and hard work.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Most people prefer it when things are simple\nenough to be judged on face value alone.\c\nAnd proving your worth by moving up through\nour ranks is something anyone can understand.\c\nKeep at it, and even if you did fall from the sky,\npeople may be more willing to accept you.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Working your way through the ranks will also be\na help if you wish to make a life for yourself here.\c\nA higher rank will grant you access to more types\nof Poké Balls and greater rewards.[VAR 0114(0008)]
You might also want to talk to the man who\nloiters at the stairs about expanding your satchel.
For today, at least, you’ve earned yourself a meal\nat the Wallflower and a good night’s rest.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 505]
So, [VAR 0100(0000)], my [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl![VAR 0114(0005)]
I believe a jolly good congratulations is in order!\nWell done on earning your First Star rank![VAR 0114(0005)]
Our usual order of potato mochi tastes even\nbetter when there’s something to celebrate![VAR 0114(0006)]
Hey, by the way—have you taken on that request\nBeauregard had?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Potato mochi tastes so much better when you\nhave something to be happy about![VAR 0114(0007)]
Still, we’ll be very busy from now on between our\nSurvey Corps duties and requests from folks here.\c\nWhich reminds me—have you already taken on\nthat request from Beauregard?[VAR 0114(0007)]
I sure have
Not yet
Well, most people here don’t know much about\nPokémon. You’ve noticed, right?\c\nSo it’s our job as the Survey Corps to take care\nof any issues that crop up because of that.\r\nWe’re basically Pokémon problem solvers.[VAR 0114(0006)]
The people of Jubilife aren’t too familiar with\nPokémon, you see...\c\nSo if problems arise, the Survey Corps gets\ncalled to help.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Indeed so!\c\nSome people will ask you for help when you talk\nwith them, while other requests will need to be\r\nclaimed from the blackboard I keep in my lab.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Speaking of which, weren’t you approached with\na request recently, Rei? What’s it all about?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Speaking of which, weren’t you approached with\na request recently, Akari? What’s it all about?[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]That one...might be a better fit for\n[VAR 0100(0000)] than me.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I don’t think I’ll be able to pull it off unless I get\nbetter at Pokémon battling first.[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]About that... I was thinking maybe\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\ncould\r\nhandle\r\nit\r\nfor me.[VAR 0114(0007)]
I was told it would require a bit of skill with\nbattling Pokémon, so...[VAR 0114(0007)]
Ah, yes. That request came from Mai of the\nDiamond Clan, if I recall correctly?[VAR 0114(0005)]
The people of the Diamond Clan have lived here\nin Hisui since before the Galaxy Team arrived.\c\nIf we could establish good relations, I’m sure\nthere is much we might learn from them,\r\nincluding more about the local Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0005)]
But we can discuss all that tomorrow! For today,\nwe should eat up and get some rest.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 526]
The next day...
[VAR BD06(0000)]Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]—before I go\nmeet\r\nMai\r\nabout\r\nthat\r\nrequest,\r\nmind\r\nshowing\r\nme\r\nhow\r\nyou\r\ndo\r\nin battle?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Of course
Bit busy here...
Great. I’ll be at the training grounds.\c\nIf you’ve been catching lots of Pokémon, you\ncan change up your team at the pastures, just\r\nso you know.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Please? Just humor me![VAR 0114(0006)]
Listen—do you have a bit of time after this?\nThere’s something I could use your help with.[VAR 0114(0007)]
All right
Wait—now?
Thank you! I’ll be waiting for you at the training\ngrounds, then.\c\nIf you’ve caught a lot of Pokémon, you may want\nto visit the pastures to change up your team.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Come on—please? I need your help. I mean...as\nyour superior, I order you to help me![VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 538]
Thanks for taking a minute for me. I know your\nplate’s full right now.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m going to be straightforward with you\nabout something.[VAR 0114(0006)]
And that is?
Everything all right?
I don’t understand how anyone can handle taking\non Pokémon in battle!\c\nI know I’m a Survey Corps member, and I’ve even\ngot my own partner...but I just can’t do it![VAR 0114(0006)]
Your partner?
You have a Pokémon?
That’s right! Take a look at...my very own partner![VAR 0114(0006)]
Bigaaah!
This is my Pikachu.\c\nDuring that Shinx attack, I should’ve had Pikachu\nfight at my side...but my mind just went blank.[VAR 0114(0006)]
And—and really, when you get right down to it,\nPokémon are terrifying, right? Why should this\r\nthing be able to fire electricity?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Biga!
But watching you at work completing those\nresearch tasks convinced me.\c\nIf I want to do my Survey Corps work well, my\npartner and I have got to be a team.[VAR 0114(0006)]
And our first step toward being a real team...\nis to battle your team![VAR 0114(0006)]
Thanks for coming. I know you’re busy.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Listen—I’ve had an epiphany![VAR 0114(0007)]
And that is?
Everything all right?
You see, I’ve got a partner of my own. We may\nnot get along perfectly, but we’ve got to work\r\ntogether to help complete the Pokédex![VAR 0114(0007)]
Your partner?
You have a Pokémon?
Yes! Here—this is my partner, Pikachu![VAR 0114(0007)]
Bigaaah!
When we were attacked by those Shinx, I got too\nscared to think straight, and...I couldn’t handle\r\nbattling as a team.\c\nEver since then, my partner’s refused to listen to\nanything I tell him...[VAR 0114(0007)]
And if I’m being honest, I’m not even sure how to\norder him—how to guide him in battle.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Biga!
But when I saw how you and your Pokémon work\ntogether, I realized we needed to do more, too...[VAR 0114(0007)]
So please! Have a battle with me. I want to learn\nhow to fight effectively![VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 567]
That was amazing![VAR 0114(0006)]
The way you fight alongside your Pokémon—\nyou don’t seem one bit scared of battling.[VAR 0114(0006)]
We’ll just have to catch up as best we can.\nRight, Pikachu?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Bigaaah!
Ah. Fair enough.\c\nPikachu’s got a bit of a tendency to attack, y’see.\nThat’s why he normally stays in his ball.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I guess the first step for Pikachu and me might be\ngetting a little friendlier with one another...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh, by the way, the professor said Pokémon have\nthese things called “types,” which apparently\r\nmake a big difference in how battles go!\c\nPikachu here seems to be an Electric type,\nfor example.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Phew. Thank you for battling us.[VAR 0114(0007)]
I could be wrong, but...for a moment, I felt like\nPikachu and I finally understood one another.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Let’s keep working at it. OK, Pikachu?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Bigaaah!
G-guess I was wrong, then.\c\nBut I’ll strive to work more as a team with my\npartner, the way you do...[VAR 0114(0007)]
Assuming Pikachu and I can...bridge some gaps.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Oh, by the way—the professor said Pokémon\nhave things called “types,” which apparently\r\nmake a big difference in how battles go!\c\nPikachu seems to be an Electric type,\nfor example.[VAR 0114(0007)]
So you’re the one? That new recruit everyone’s\ntalking about?[VAR 0114(0004)]
The name’s Zisu. Captain of the Security Corps.[VAR 0114(001B)]
I see you’ve got some fight in you. Figured I’d\nstop by and give what advice I could.[VAR 0114(001B)]
Captain Zisu’s a master of an ancient martial art\nwhere you guide Pokémon in battle.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Captain Zisu is a master of an ancient martial\nart—one that specializes in Pokémon battles.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Now listen—if your Pokémon’s truly mastered its\nmoves, it can actually use them in different styles![VAR 0114(001B)]
On the one hand, you can choose to deliver a\nmove in the [VAR FF00(0006)]strong style[VAR FF00(0000)].\c\nThe move will deal more damage, but afterward\nit’ll take longer for your Pokémon to act.[VAR 0114(001B)]
On the other hand, you can choose to unleash\na move in the [VAR FF00(0006)]agile style[VAR FF00(0000)].\c\nSuch a move will have less power behind it, but\nyour Pokémon can act more quickly afterward.\c\nIn truly favorable conditions, it might even get\nout two moves before the opponent can act.[VAR 0114(001B)]
Strong style moves, agile style moves, and of\ncourse, regular moves... Choose which is right for\r\na given situation, and direct your Pokémon with a\r\nlittle nudge.[VAR 0114(001B)]
Oh, one more thing—if you want to teach your\nPokémon some powerful moves, just let me know![VAR 0114(001B)]
Well, that’s certainly handy to find out about\nbefore going to tackle Mai’s request![VAR 0114(0006)]
Zisu’s teachings should serve you well when\nyou’re up against tough Pokémon!\c\nNow I suppose it’s time I went to meet Mai.[VAR 0114(0007)]
You remember? I mentioned it earlier. I’m\nheading down now to see about Mai’s request.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m supposed to meet her down past the foot\nof Aspiration Hill. You should come along, too!\r\nGet ready, then meet us down there, would you?\c\nAnd by “ready,” I mean double-checking what\nPokémon you’ll bring...and maybe even teaching\r\nthem some new moves from Zisu![VAR 0114(0006)]
You remember? I mentioned at the Wallflower\nthat I could use your help with Mai’s request.[VAR 0114(0007)]
I’m to meet her down past the foot of\nAspiration Hill.\c\nYou should come as well—once you’ve readied\nyour Pokémon team and perhaps had them learn\r\nsome new moves from Zisu, if you’d like![VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 598]
There are many strong Pokémon that make their\nhome on the other side of this bridge!\c\nI can’t let you pass unless you’re a First—\nOh, at your rank, you should be fine! Go on, then!
Don’t let your guard down, now. Retreat to safety\nif you find yourself in trouble!
[~ 601]
Boo![VAR 0114(000C)]
Did I surprise you? I bet I did!\c\nI was trying to, anyway.[VAR 0114(000C)]
There’s a secret technique to catching Pokémon,\nyou see.[VAR 0114(000C)]
It’s what I call the Secret Back Strike Technique!\c\nHitting a Pokémon’s back with your Poké Ball will\nsurprise it, making it easier to catch or giving you\r\nan advantage once a battle starts![VAR 0114(000C)]
If you’re part of the Survey Corps now, working\nto create that Pokédex as they all are, you might\r\nend up meeting every last Pokémon here in Hisui.[VAR 0114(000C)]
You should know I’m already looking forward\nto the day you accomplish that![VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 608]
Over here![VAR 0114(0006)]
This here is [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0006)]
Over here![VAR 0114(0007)]
Mai. This is [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0007)]
My, my... A new face in the village?\c\nNot that it matters to me if you’re new. If you’re\nhere, I assume you’re prepared to be of help.[VAR 0114(000F)]
I am one of the wardens of the Diamond Clan.\nYou may call me Mai.[VAR 0114(000F)]
I suppose you might not even know what a\nwarden is, if you’re new to Hisui...[VAR 0114(000F)]
But such talk can wait. Right now, I’d rather we\nget straight to the point.\c\nI have a problem that I need help solving. So the\nmore important question is this...[VAR 0114(000F)]
Do you feel confident that you can lead your\nPokémon in battle?[VAR 0114(000F)]
I do
Not really...
That’s good to hear.\c\nThat Security Corps of yours certainly wasn’t\nup to the task.[VAR 0114(000F)]
This here is my partner, Munchlax. We were\nraised together like siblings.\c\nHe battles at my side by choice, without needing\nany silly little balls like you use. Watch and learn.[VAR 0114(000F)]
How uninspiring... Prepare yourself better, then\nrejoin us.[VAR 0114(000F)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : chap_02
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Muuun...
You really aren’t one of the usual Galaxy\nbuffoons if you could defeat my partner...[VAR 0114(000F)]
Well fought, Munchlax.[VAR 0114(000F)]
I’ll take care of the Pokémon that battled for us.[VAR 0114(000F)]
And I’ll let you have these.\c\nYou people make all kinds of things with your\ncrafting, don’t you? These should prove to be\r\nuseful materials.[VAR 0114(000F)]
You and your Pokémon fought well together!\nYou practically acted as one with [VAR 1101(00FD,0402)]itthem.\c\nRather like the legendary hero of old... The one\nwe tell stories of to our children.[VAR 0114(000F)]
I think you’re indeed the one for the job.\c\nYou see, I need someone to deal with an alpha\nPokémon causing trouble upon Deertrack Heights.[VAR 0114(000F)]
It is a large, fearsome foe—like any alpha—but\nyou’ll come, won’t you?\c\nTo Deertrack Heights?[VAR 0114(000F)]
Your Arc Phone is beeping...
Is that strange thingummy of yours telling you\nwhere to go?[VAR 0114(0006)]
That thing you have... It’s showing you where\nyou’ve got to go, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(0007)]
My, my, that is some curious sort of map.\c\nIs that one of those Galaxy Team inventions\nI keep hearing about?[VAR 0114(000F)]
It certainly does seem to show the way to\nDeertrack Heights, up ahead of us.[VAR 0114(000F)]
I’ll leave this bit to you! You shouldn’t have any\nproblem handling an alpha.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ll leave this in your hands. You’ll do great out\nthere—I know it![VAR 0114(0007)]
It seems you’re quite the asset to the Survey\nCorps, new one.[VAR 0114(000F)]
[~ 16]
Time to go meet Mai![VAR 0114(0006)]
She belongs to the Diamond Clan, like the\nprofessor mentioned.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m told the Diamond Clan folk coexist with\nPokémon here in Hisui, working together with\r\nthem to survive.[VAR 0114(0006)]
And don’t worry about her request—I doubt it’ll\nbe much trouble, knowing you. See you down\r\npast the foot of Aspiration Hill![VAR 0114(0006)]
Good morning! Ready for another day on\nthe job?[VAR 0114(0007)]
About the Diamond Clan, who Mai’s with—\nthey’re an assembly of people living here in\r\nHisui, with the help of Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0007)]
It seems Mai’s got quite the favor to ask you,\nbut I think you’ll have it well in hand.\c\nYou’ll find us down past the foot of\nAspiration Hill![VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 24]
We need to head to the Fieldlands Camp to\nmeet Mai, right? Don’t know why the professor\r\ndecided he should head over there too, but...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I believe Mai will be waiting for us at the\nFieldlands Camp. The professor headed that\r\nway, too—though I couldn’t tell you why.[VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 27]
Though...\c\nBefore we continue, I must ask. Do you already\nknow about almighty Sinnoh?[VAR 0114(000F)]
Of course!
Almighty what, now?
My, my. How about that.\c\nThough I’m not certain you’ve been told the true\nstory. The true story is this...[VAR 0114(000F)]
I suppose that’s to be expected. Allow me to\nsketch out the basics...[VAR 0114(000F)]
Almighty Sinnoh steers all time. It’s said to have\ncreated the very universe using its power over\r\ntime’s flow, and this land of Hisui was born in\r\nthe process.\c\nIt’s by the grace of almighty Sinnoh that Pokémon\ncan live and thrive here.[VAR 0114(000F)]
We of the Diamond Clan are descendants of a\npeople who crossed the sea and settled here in\r\nthe Hisui region to venerate almighty Sinnoh.[VAR 0114(000F)]
However, it stole away from the world long ago,\nhiding itself from our sight...\c\nAlmighty Sinnoh has only rarely been seen by\nany human, if the old tales are to be trusted.[VAR 0114(000F)]
But there are still Pokémon here today in Hisui\nwith a connection to almighty Sinnoh.\c\nAnd it is the duty of wardens like myself to\nattend to their needs.[VAR 0114(000F)]
The Pokémon that graces Deertrack Heights is\none of those honored few. It is directly\r\ndescended from a Pokémon that was blessed\r\nwith almighty Sinnoh’s protection.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Follow me, and you may understand.[VAR 0114(000F)]
[~ 39]
Oh? So even your professor decided to join us?[VAR 0114(000F)]
Whew... Thank goodness... I got here in time...[VAR 0114(0005)]
As a Pokémon researcher, I could hardly miss out\non a chance to observe an alpha, now, could I?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I suppose that is your business... Fine—as long as\nyou stay out of the way.[VAR 0114(000F)]
This is Deertrack Heights...\c\nThis is where I’ve long come to pay tribute to a\nspecial Pokémon—a Pokémon descended from\r\none of those ancients blessed by almighty Sinnoh.[VAR 0114(000F)]
De-le-le wooooooooooop!
That’s not it.\c\nThat’s only a troublemaker, here to disturb the\npeace with its racket.[VAR 0114(000F)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]And that’s what you’re here for,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]:\r\nto drive\r\nthat\r\ninterloper\r\nfrom\r\nthis place.\c\nI’ll ensure your Pokémon are ready for the battle.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Upon my word...what a large specimen!\c\nLittle wonder alpha Pokémon are feared across\nthe land if they’re all as oversized as this one![VAR 0114(0005)]
Exactly. They’re not only big, though.\c\nThey are strong and may know moves that others\nof their kind do not.\c\nThey’re naught to be trifled with, let me tell you.\nNevertheless...[VAR 0114(000F)]
I believe you are stronger still than this alpha.\nSo go show it that, beyond any mistaking![VAR 0114(000F)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Be careful, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Size is a\npotent\r\nweapon\r\nin and\r\nof itself.\r\nNo doubt\r\nthis alpha\r\nis a\r\npowerful and\r\nhardy foe.\c\nIf you must face it, make sure your Pokémon\nha[VAR 1101(00FD,0201)]sve some strong moves at [VAR 1101(00FD,0503)]itstheir disposal.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 52]
De-le-le wooooooooooop!
[~ 54]
You really are an impressive one, aren’t you?\c\nSeeing someone best an alpha like that... It truly\nreminds me of the legendary hero of old![VAR 0114(000F)]
We’d best make sure your Pokémon [VAR 1101(00FD,0302)]isare taken\ncare of after facing off against such a foe.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Wyeeeeeeer!
Wh-what in the world?![VAR 0114(0005)]
It’s the great Wyrdeer![VAR 0114(000F)]
... ... ...\n... ... ...
[VAR BD06(0000)]He looks upon you with kindness,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(000F)]
I’d say the great Wyrdeer has taken a liking to\nyou. That is fortunate.\c\nHe is an esteemed Pokémon that can dash across\nthe expanses of Hisui while bearing a human on\r\nhis back—a human he deems worthy, at least.\c\nHe is a blessing to us all.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Remarkable! Truly outstanding stuff! A Pokémon\nletting someone ride on it... Why, it’s just like the\r\nRide Pokémon of Alola![VAR 0114(0005)]
Professor! I take it things went smoothly?[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I’m here on Captain Cyllene’s orders.\c\nShe said we’d be able to set up a base camp\nhere once [VAR 0100(0000)] took care of\r\nher request.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Professor Laventon! [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0007)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Captain Cyllene sent me.\c\nShe said that once [VAR 0100(0000)]\ncarried\r\nout\r\nthis\r\nrequest,\r\nwe’d\r\nbe\r\nable\r\nto\r\nset up\r\na base camp.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Ah, about that. I know this was a joint decision by\nAdaman and the commander, but still—is it truly\r\nfine for us to set up more base camps like this?[VAR 0114(0005)]
The Hisui region is a land created by almighty\nSinnoh for the sake of its Pokémon.\c\nAs long as your goal is to coexist and thrive\ntogether with the Pokémon, then I imagine you\r\nshould also be allowed to use this land.[VAR 0114(000F)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]The great Wyrdeer has taken a liking to\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nas well.\r\nThis is a good sign.[VAR 0114(000F)]
You have my thanks for what you did today.\nOur clan leader will hear of how you aided us.\c\nI’ll come to show my appreciation with a proper\nreward as soon as I can.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Well, if we’re to “coexist and thrive” with\nPokémon, we’ll need to know them better.\c\nAnd the first step toward that is completing\nthe Pokédex![VAR 0114(0006)]
The Construction Corps should be here soon.\nThey’ll have our new base camp pitched in\r\nno time![VAR 0114(0006)]
If we want to “coexist and thrive” with Pokémon,\nwe’ll need to stop fearing them and start getting\r\nto know them better. That starts with completing\r\nthe Pokédex![VAR 0114(0007)]
Anyway, we should be able to have that base\ncamp set up once the Construction Corps arrives.[VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 76]
Here we have it—our new base camp upon\nDeertrack Heights! I’ll call it...the Heights Camp![VAR 0114(0005)]
From now on, when you set out from the village,\nyou can ask to be escorted to this base camp to\r\nstart your excursions directly from here.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Having more base camps oughta make our survey\nwork easier, huh?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Well, that’s that. How about we head to the\nWallflower like usual?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Having another base camp to start from will be a\ngreat help on our surveys![VAR 0114(0007)]
Nice work today, everyone. What say we all head\nback to the Wallflower?[VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 83]
Beni, old chum, the usual potato mochi, please!\nAnd make it for three today as well![VAR 0114(0005)]
Have you all heard the grave news?\c\nThat frenzied Kleavor from the rumors... It ended\nup mauling some of our Galaxy folks who went\r\nout to investigate it this morning.\c\nThe Medical Corps has had a hard time getting\nall the injured back on their feet...[VAR 0114(000E)]
Ah. This is the Kleavor that was reportedly struck\nby powerful lightning, yes? I did hear he’s been\r\nbehaving most erratically since then...[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Still, if further investigation is in order, the\nSurvey Corps will, of course, step up to the task.\c\nA certain amount of danger is inevitable when\nresearching unfamiliar Pokémon, but I’m sure\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)] here can handle things\r\njust fine![VAR 0114(0005)]
But that Kleavor’s said to be much, much\nstronger than even an alpha Pokémon, isn’t he?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Are you certain? I’ve heard Kleavor’s so mighty,\neven alpha Pokémon don’t compare to him...[VAR 0114(0007)]
Now now! You forget that the strengths of\nPokémon are key items of information that we\r\nof the Survey Corps are duty bound to research!\c\nAnd since this perilous work of ours calls for a\nclear head and fighting-fit physique...\c\nI do believe a good night’s sleep is in order\nafter this fine meal.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 91]
Rise and shine, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
The boss wants you!\c\nKamado, that is. Get yourself to the\ncommander’s office![VAR 0114(0006)]
Good morning, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0007)]
You should hurry to the commander’s office\nbefore he decides to use you for sumo practice![VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 96]
Did you get a good rest?[VAR 0114(0006)]
There you are. Let’s hurry to headquarters.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Look who’s being punctual!\c\nFinally realized you’re wasting almighty Sinnoh’s\nprecious time by bowing to a sham?[VAR 0114(000A)]
There you go again, insisting on your false image\nof almighty Sinnoh as a ruler of time!\c\nMy people follow the true almighty Sinnoh—the\nfont of all creation and ruler of space![VAR 0114(000B)]
Hah! You could have all the space there is and\nstill not know what to do with it.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Excuse me? Are you really suggesting that you\nmake better use of your time than we make of\r\nvast Hisui’s space?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Better than some! It’s a miracle you showed up\non time, oh mighty leader of the Pearl Clan.\c\nI worried you’d get lost in the pointlessly vast\nspace you’re so fond of and never show up.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Me, get lost? In almighty Sinnoh’s great gift to\nthe Pearl Clan—in our world’s very basis?\r\nYou wish![VAR 0114(000B)]
I wish that I hadn’t let myself get dragged into\narguing with you. Almighty Sinnoh forgive me—\r\nwhat a waste of time!\c\nI’m off to Commander Kamado’s office![VAR 0114(000A)]
I believe it was you who started this![VAR 0114(000B)]
Just another day with those two, I see.[VAR 0114(0006)]
That man’s named Adaman. He’s the leader of\nthe Diamond Clan. They put a lot of importance\r\non time, as you could probably tell.[VAR 0114(0006)]
And the girl is Irida, leader of the Pearl Clan.\nThey’re all about space—you heard what she\r\ncalled it, right? “Our world’s very basis.”[VAR 0114(0006)]
Whenever they run into each other, those same\narguments flare up.\c\nSeems like they’ve inherited some bad blood\nfrom their predecessors’ strife.[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Ah well. Not our problem.\c\nBut you’ll have problems if you don’t get yourself\nto the commander’s office,\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
You can feel the tension when those two show up.[VAR 0114(0007)]
You haven’t met them, have you? The woman\nwith the reverence for space is Irida, leader of\r\nthe Pearl Clan.[VAR 0114(0007)]
The man who was going on and on about time,\nAdaman, leads the Diamond Clan.[VAR 0114(0007)]
The Diamond Clan and the Pearl Clan grudgingly\ncoexist at the moment. Apparently, things used to\r\nbe less peaceful.[VAR 0114(0007)]
But the boss—I mean, the commander—is waiting.\c\nWe should save this conversation for after you\nreport to him.[VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 117]
What do you intend to do about that Kleavor,\nCommander Kamado?!\c\nHe may be descended from a warrior of almighty\nSinnoh, but look at the mess he’s causing.\r\nWe can’t sit back and let him rage on![VAR 0114(000A)]
You do get right to the point, Adaman...[VAR 0114(0009)]
Time wasted is lost.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Well, tell me—what would you have us do?\nKleavor is a precious lord of the Pearl Clan,\r\nis he not?[VAR 0114(0009)]
That’s the point. My clan can’t intervene directly\nwhere a lord of the Pearl Clan’s concerned.\c\nIf my people were to do something, our two\nclans might end up back at each other’s throats—\r\njust like we used to be.[VAR 0114(000A)]
But even folk of the Galaxy Team have been\nwounded, haven’t they? Seems someone’s got\r\nto do something here...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Who, then? Would the Diamond Clan have\nthe Pearl Clan bring down one of its own\r\nhonored nobles?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I don’t believe I said that. Thought it, maybe.[VAR 0114(000A)]
You might as well have said it, you fool!\c\nLook—we don’t even know what drove Lord\nKleavor into such a violent frenzy.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’d like to know that myself. This is a first as far as\nmy clan knows, too.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Hrrrm. I see you’ve arrived.[VAR 0114(0009)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]This is [VAR 0100(0000)], the newest\nmember\r\nof our\r\nSurvey Corps.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Aha! I hear from Mai you earned Wyrdeer’s favor.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Good to finally meet you, stranger from the rift![VAR 0114(000A)]
I’m “Adaman, leader of the Diamond Clan,”\nif you want to be formal!\c\nBut that’s a mouthful. Just call me Adaman.[VAR 0114(000A)]
If you came from beyond the space-time rift...\ncould you be from the space where almighty\r\nSinnoh is said to reside?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m Irida, leader of the Pearl Clan! Caution and\nforesight are my watchwords.\c\nWhich is why I have trouble believing such a tale.\nCould you really have passed through that rift?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I have a proposition. Why not send this one to\nstudy Kleavor before deciding what must be done?[VAR 0114(0009)]
You’d send this stranger, who supposedly fell\nfrom the rift, to study Kleavor? This newcomer\r\nwith no experience?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Says the leader with almost no experience.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Being a good leader isn’t a matter of time—it’s a\nmatter of embracing Hisui’s vastness without fear![VAR 0114(000B)]
Well, then, there you have it. If how new you are\ndoesn’t matter, then let’s give the kid h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser chance.\c\nI’m sold, Commander. Let’s try this your way![VAR 0114(000A)]
This should be fun. I’ll get to see how good you\nGalaxy folk really are, with all your weird ways—\r\nputting Pokémon in those strange balls and what\r\nhave you.[VAR 0114(000A)]
That whole practice bothers me!\c\nAlmighty Sinnoh made Hisui vast so Pokémon\ncould live freely throughout.\c\nWe’re meant to stand alongside Pokémon, not\ncount ourselves above them![VAR 0114(000B)]
We do not use Poké Balls from a desire to control\nour Pokémon. Only so that we can live together.\r\nAllow us to show you what we can do![VAR 0114(0009)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]This is your mission now,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nI order you to study Kleavor and help us find the\ntruth of this situation![VAR 0114(0009)]
I accept!
Uh...
Remember that you are a stranger who appeared\none day out of the very sky above us. People are\r\nnaturally suspicious of your presence here.[VAR 0114(0009)]
If you wish to be fully accepted and trusted, you\nmust work hard. Work yourself to the very bone.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Well, that’s settled. And there’s no time like\nthe present![VAR 0114(000A)]
The Lord of the Woods—Kleavor—is descended\nfrom a Pokémon that was blessed with almighty\r\nSinnoh’s own power.\c\nNo other Pokémon you’ve yet encountered can\ncompare to his strength. Be warned.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Listen to me.\c\nThe Galaxy Expedition Team has come to the\nHisui region as a group of outsiders. Some might\r\neven call us interlopers.\c\nWe mustn’t do anything to threaten our relations\nwith the Diamond and Pearl Clans. Understand?[VAR 0114(0009)]
If we’re to survive here in Hisui, we must learn\nabout the Pokémon surrounding us.\c\nIf they stand against us or would do us harm,\nthen we will subdue them...as we must.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Join me downstairs, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nWe’ll cover the details of this new mission.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 153]
Ah, good! You’re already here![VAR 0114(0005)]
Professor Laventon. The briefing, if you please.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Yes, let’s get right to it.\nSo, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nI understand you’ve been requested to find out\nthe cause of Kleavor’s frenzied state.\c\nBut as you’re aware by now, Kleavor is a mighty\nthing. Nigh invincible, even![VAR 0114(0005)]
The Security Corps tried throwing Poké Balls\nat Kleavor when they were attacked, but...[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m afraid they didn’t even come close to\ncatching him!\c\nIt seems he’s a far trickier opponent than even\nthose aggressive species of Pokémon that cannot\r\nbe caught outside of battle once they’re riled.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’d like to be perfectly clear on this point.\c\nThis mission will put you in extreme danger.\nDo you believe you can handle it?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Of course!
Not particularly
Very well. Then let us go over the particulars.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Well, you’ve no choice in the matter.\c\nLet us go over the details you need to know.\nYou have a mission to carry out.[VAR 0114(0008)]
The Diamond and Pearl Clans revere their nobles\nbecause they believe these Pokémon serve their\r\n“almighty Sinnoh.”\c\nThey leave offerings to express their gratitude\nto these Pokémon in locations they call the\r\nnobles’ seats.[VAR 0114(0008)]
So perhaps a good starting point for our research\ncould be to find out what sorts of offerings they\r\nnormally leave for this Kleavor.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! We need to speak\nwith you.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Listen—that rift in space-time seems like it\nconnects this world to a whole other world.\c\nThat world might be where almighty Sinnoh\nitself resides—the true almighty Sinnoh, that is.\r\nThe one that rules over time![VAR 0114(000A)]
So if you fell through the space-time rift, that\nmight mean...you traveled through time—\r\nby almighty Sinnoh’s own power!\c\nThink of it! You must’ve been just swimming in\nits divine might!\c\nWell, I’ve got a favor to ask of you, oh amazing\ntime traveler.\c\nDon’t just study Kleavor. Quell his frenzy![VAR 0114(000A)]
Well, you certainly caught us at a good time,\nyoung Adaman!\c\nWe were just discussing our next steps with\nregard to this whole Kleavor situation.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oho! You must be that Galaxy Team scholar I’ve\nheard about. Good to meet you, Mr. Professor.\r\nShare some of that knowledge with me sometime![VAR 0114(000A)]
Now, let me elaborate a little...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Those Pearl Clan types have a lot of respect for\nKleavor. You heard his title—Lord of the Woods.\c\nI’m sure they’d rather get this under control, too,\nbut it’s hard for them to come right out and ask\r\nthose of the Galaxy Team, of all people, for help.[VAR 0114(000A)]
And the truth is, we in the Diamond Clan have a\nsimilar problem on our hands.\c\nA Pokémon dear to us, off in the mountains, has\nflown into the same type of frenzy as Kleavor.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Now, there’s certainly bad blood between us and\nthe Pearl Clan, but still...\c\nWe’ve all got to share Hisui, and that means we\nought to tackle our problems together.[VAR 0114(000A)]
But there aren’t many capable of standing up\nto such powerful Pokémon. You’re the best\r\nhope we’ve got.[VAR 0114(000F)]
You’ll find Kleavor at Grandtree Arena. That’s in\nthe very heart of the Heartwood. His warden is a\r\nboy named Lian.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Lian is a brilliant child but also a bit... Well.\nSometimes brilliance can be blinding, you know.\c\nHe’ll tell you all about his beloved Kleavor—\nwhether you wish him to or not.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Anyway, I’m sure you’re up to the challenge...so\nwe’ll be counting on you! See you later![VAR 0114(000A)]
Wow. He just said his piece and then vanished.\nHe must just value his time that much...I guess.[VAR 0114(0006)]
He certainly left quickly once he’d finished\ntalking. I suppose he really values his time.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Adaman and Mai weren’t wrong, you know.\nIf you’re to study and perhaps even quell\r\nKleavor, you’d best start by visiting his abode.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Now that we’ve got the Heights Camp, it should\ncome in handy for getting to Grandtree Arena.\c\nAnd don’t forget to visit the pastures! Choosing\nyour Pokémon team carefully makes a difference.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Our new Heights Camp would be a handy place\nfor setting out toward Grandtree Arena.\c\nAnd you should stop by the pastures, too. You’ll\nwant to choose the best Pokémon to bring.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Our investigation for the commander will grind to\na halt if you become incapacitated, recruit.\c\nI should like to avoid that outcome.\c\nI imagine you would as well, since it would mean\nlosing the food and shelter we provide for you.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 185]
Finding yourself unable to pick up the materials\nyou come across? Satchel always seeming full?\c\nIf that sounds like you, it’d be wise to lend me\nyour ear a moment and hear what I have to say.[VAR 0114(009D)]
[~ 187]
How are things, my good friend![VAR 0114(000C)]
I certainly hope you’re putting that Secret Back\nStrike Technique I taught you to good use![VAR 0114(000C)]
Either way, I have some Super Potions here,\njust for you!\c\nOh, think nothing of it! Having the Survey Corps\nout and about studying Pokémon is great for\r\nbusiness, you know.\c\nSupporting you now is actually an investment in\nmy own fortunes![VAR 0114(000C)]
And now I must depart! There are ruins that are\njust calling to me![VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 192]
[~ 193]
[~ 194]
[~ 195]
[~ 196]
[~ 197]
[~ 198]
[~ 199]
You managed to take on a powerful alpha.\nI see promise in you.[VAR 0114(000A)]
If you hope to reach the Grandtree Arena,\nperhaps consult that mystical map of yours?[VAR 0114(000F)]
[~ 202]
I’m Lian of the Pearl Clan. The warden to\nKleavor, Lord of the Woods.[VAR 0114(0010)]
And you—I’ve already deduced that you’ve\ncome here to meet Kleavor. I’m right, aren’t I?[VAR 0114(0010)]
Of course I am! I can see it so clearly.\c\nAfter all, the powerfully awesome Kleavor has\nbecome even more awesomely powerful![VAR 0114(0010)]
Perhaps that strange lightning the other day was\nalmighty Sinnoh’s divine power...\c\nBut whatever it was, it struck my lord and left him\nimbued with awesome might!\c\nSo I must turn you away, even if it pains me. It’s\ntoo dangerous for you to meet Kleavor right now.[VAR 0114(0010)]
I’ll do anything!
That’s that, then
Oh! Such earnest desire to meet mighty Kleavor!\nI have to admit I’m struck by your passion...[VAR 0114(0010)]
Truly? You mean to simply give up?! Is your\npassion for Kleavor so paltry?![VAR 0114(0010)]
But, well...I’m afraid your passion is not the real\nissue here...\c\nI’ve been told in no uncertain terms by Irida that\nI am to let no one near Kleavor![VAR 0114(0010)]
I will fight you off myself if you insist.\c\nIf you wish to avoid battle, withdraw now, while\nyou still can! Or face the wrath of my Goomy![VAR 0114(0010)]
I’ll take you on
I’m going to bow out
You don’t even realize I’m turning you away for\nyour own safety! How sad you are...\c\nGo, Goomy, and see if you can ooze some good\nsense over this foolish troublemaker![VAR 0114(0010)]
[~ 216]
H-how can this be...[VAR 0114(0010)]
I may’ve been defeated, but my point still stands!\nIt’s too dangerous to meet Kleavor now.\c\nThe only welcome you’ll get if you approach him\nis a flurry of devastating blows![VAR 0114(0010)]
Normally, I’d simply try making him an offering...\c\nA nice heaped helping of his two favorite foods,\nserved up with respect by his loyal warden—\r\nthat’s me, o’ course—is usually enough to please\r\nhim and soothe the prickliest of moods...[VAR 0114(0010)]
But even I, Kleavor’s loyal warden, can’t get\nclose enough to give any offerings now—not with\r\nthe way Kleavor is rampaging and running amok.\c\nThere’s nothing that an outsider like you can do.[VAR 0114(0010)]
The ancestors of Kleavor, Wyrdeer, and their\ncohort drew on almighty Sinnoh’s own power to\r\nprotect Pokémon and people alike—so it’s said.\c\nIt’s by their grace that our clan—that any of us—\nstill lives in vast Hisui today![VAR 0114(000B)]
Irida? What are you doing here?[VAR 0114(0010)]
As you say, Kleavor’s grown even stronger, but\nI’m afraid that strength poses a problem for us.\c\nIf he was indeed struck by that lightning...could\nthe bolts have been sent by the false Sinnoh that\r\nthe Diamond Clan bows to?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Kleavor means so much to our clan...\c\nI’d hoped we could bring this situation under\ncontrol ourselves, not throw our hands up and\r\nask some outsider for help...[VAR 0114(000B)]
But we must save Kleavor from this frenzy.\nEvery moment it continues, the danger grows.\c\nIf more people and Pokémon are attacked,\nit will lead to conflict with both the Diamond\r\nClan and the Galaxy Team.[VAR 0114(000B)]
You! Stranger from beyond the sky! Tell me...\nCould you Galaxy people actually fix all this?\c\nCould an outsider actually find a way to quell\nour lord’s frenzy?[VAR 0114(0010)]
I’ll figure something out
I don’t know
Very well!\c\nLian and I will gather foods that please Kleavor,\nin hopes that we might be able to get close\r\nenough to make him a proper offering.\c\nAs for you—find a way to quell his frenzy, even\nif you must search every corner of vast Hisui![VAR 0114(000B)]
Your commander tasked you with investigating\nthis mess, didn’t he?\c\nLian and I will gather foods that please Kleavor,\nin hopes that we might be able to get close\r\nenough to make him a proper offering.\c\nAs for you—find a way to quell his frenzy, even\nif you have to search every corner of vast Hisui![VAR 0114(000B)]
We can’t let Kleavor remain some pariah.\nIt isn’t right![VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m not actually opposed to Kleavor remaining\nas powerful as he is now, but I suppose if Irida is\r\nbothered, then we must do something...[VAR 0114(0010)]
Your Arc Phone is beeping...
A mysterious power now enables you to return\nto base camps in an instant!
[~ 235]
Good to see you, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nAnd how is your research into Kleavor going?\nSwimmingly, I expect?[VAR 0114(0005)]
...Oho, is that so? Now that’s quite the tidbit!\c\nSo a serving of his favorite foods will normally\nmake Kleavor quite agreeable—is that it?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I need to mull this over back at the laboratory.\nYou should come along, too, dear [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], my [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 240]
So according to the information you were able to\nlearn from Irida and Lian of the Pearl Clan...[VAR 0114(0005)]
were this the normal course of events, that\nfrenzied Kleavor would be calmed by a nice\r\nserving of his two favorite foods...[VAR 0114(0005)]
I do wonder...\c\nIs it possible that the aromas or some other\ncomponents of these foods might combine in a\r\nway that could not only calm Kleavor but draw\r\nhim back from this frenzy?[VAR 0114(0005)]
But by your own report, even Kleavor’s warden—\nwho looks after Kleavor and knows him well—\r\ncannot approach him in his current state.\c\nIt would be a fool’s gambit to get close enough\nto offer him food...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hmmm... Give me a moment, if you would.\nI need some time to ponder on this...[VAR 0114(0005)]
There ought to be something in my research\nnotes that can help us...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Eureka![VAR 0114(0005)]
We’ll simply have to throw the food!\c\nYou’ve quite the arm for throwing things, haven’t\nyou, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nMight I suggest you take Kleavor’s favorite foods\nand throw them at the Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Makes sense!
Elaborate, please?
Yes, it’s all coming together! We can use our\nskill in Poké Ball crafting to shape Kleavor’s\r\nbeloved foods into balls, then throw them to\r\nachieve the same calming effect—but from afar!\c\nA brilliant idea, if I do say so myself. As for what\nto call these yummy projectiles...\c\nWell, how about Teatime Balls? Puts one in mind\nof a nice, relaxing afternoon tea, does it not?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Are you...sure, Professor? They’re your own\ninventions—why not call them Laventon Balls?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Why wouldn’t you simply call them Laventon\nBalls, Professor?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Oh my. With that name, it’d sound like I’m the\none being launched at our frenzied friend...[VAR 0114(0005)]
In any case, we can rely on the Pearl Clan to\ngather the necessary foodstuffs, correct?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Then you should hurry back to Grandtree Arena\nand tell the Pearl Clan about our brilliant plan![VAR 0114(0006)]
Then you should get back to Grandtree Arena\nand let the Pearl Clan know our plan![VAR 0114(0007)]
If you’re off to Grandtree Arena, best set out\nfrom the Heights Camp, eh?[VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 259]
My, my, that Galaxy Hall is one fine building,\neven from the outside...\c\nThe Galaxy Team’s certainly got themselves\na grand headquarters—I’ll give them that.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Oh! Yes, I came because I had some news that\nI thought you might be interested in.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Better you actually see what’s going on, though.\nLet’s head to... What did you end up calling it?\r\nThe Heights Camp?[VAR 0114(000F)]
[~ 263]
Wyeeer!
I spoke to Wyrdeer about what’s been going on.\c\nI told him how you’ve been trekking all over the\nfieldlands seeking a way to quell Kleavor’s frenzy.[VAR 0114(000A)]
All this, from someone who’s not even part of our\nclan or the Pearl Clan.\c\nJust some wanderer who fell through a rift into\nthis world.[VAR 0114(000A)]
And hearing that... Well, you can see how\nhe responded![VAR 0114(000A)]
I trust you appreciate it.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Wyrdeer’s found you worthy, you see.\nWhich means you’ll need a flute like we have.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Mind demonstrating for h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer, Mai?[VAR 0114(000A)]
This is very important, so listen well![VAR 0114(000A)]
Wyeeer!
That’s a Celestica Flute that Mai just played.\c\nIt’s a precious tool that can be used to call on\nWyrdeer so you can ride upon him![VAR 0114(000A)]
It’s said the Celestica Flutes were gifts from\nalmighty Sinnoh itself...and now, this one’s yours![VAR 0114(000A)]
It’s not that grand a gesture, really. I can’t play\nthe flute for the life of me.[VAR 0114(000A)]
See if you can play that melody.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Wyrdeer opened his heart and learned well the\nsound of your playing!
You can now call Wyrdeer and gallop across\nthe land!
You received the Mind Plate from Wyrdeer!
Now, use that Celestica Flute wisely and gallop\nacross the land with the great Wyrdeer!\c\nYou’ve got a frenzied Pokémon to quell at\nGrandtree Arena, haven’t you?[VAR 0114(000F)]
With Wyrdeer, you can gallop across the\nfieldlands in no time![VAR 0114(000A)]
[~ 282]
So you say that you Galaxy people came up with\na method to try to quell Lord Kleavor’s frenzy?[VAR 0114(0010)]
What? You’ll mash up Kleavor’s favorite foods\ninto balls so you can THROW offerings at him?!\c\nWell, that’s quite an unorthodox approach...\c\nYou Galaxy people... Your inventiveness just\nblows me away!\c\nI mean, now you can make offerings to Lord\nKleavor...from a safe distance![VAR 0114(0010)]
I’ll lend you my aid if it means we might provide\nKleavor with his offering. Let’s begin at once![VAR 0114(0010)]
Hold on, Lian! Don’t get ahead of yourself.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Whatever the plan is, you’ll need Kleavor’s\nfavorite Plump Beans. I’ve brought them,\r\nas promised.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Gah! That’s right! My apologies, Irida—\nI’d forgotten all about you![VAR 0114(0010)]
I admit, as we haven’t been able to solve this\nourselves, we seem to have little choice but to\r\nturn to the Galaxy Team.[VAR 0114(000B)]
But even I still have my doubts about whether\nwe should entrust such a thing to an outsider.\c\nThese Galaxy Team people don’t share our\ncustoms or our values.[VAR 0114(000B)]
So prove to me you’re worthy to stand in the\npresence of our noble Pokémon!\c\nYou may battle by ordering about the Pokémon\nyou’ve caught in your little Poké Balls...\c\nBut on my side, I have a Pokémon as close to me\nas a sister—as one of my blood![VAR 0114(000B)]
If you can defeat Glaceon and me, I will entrust\nyou with Kleavor’s fate. Will you battle us?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Yes, I will
Hold on...
I’m not surprised that this would be too much to\nask of a strange outsider from the sky.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Then allow Glaceon’s true strength to chill you\nto your depths![VAR 0114(000B)]
I see now... Poké Balls are simply your tools of\nchoice, not products of disregard for Pokémon.\c\nYou still understand the Pokémon that you’ve\ncaught and treat them as partners.\c\nI feel better putting my trust in you now, I think.\nLet me see to your Pokémon’s wounds.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Now, explain the Galaxy Team’s plan. What do\nyou mean to do with these foods?[VAR 0114(000B)]
So because you have to keep your distance,\nyou’ll mash Kleavor’s favorite foods together,\r\nball them up, and try to quell his frenzy by...\r\nthrowing them at him?\c\nInteresting. So you’ve developed soothing [VAR FF00(0006)]balms\n[VAR FF00(0000)]of sorts to calm our lord...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Very well. If it’ll help soothe Kleavor’s frenzy,\nlet’s make these balms with our very hearts\r\nand souls![VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 301]
There! A veritable mountain of balms! This should\nplease Kleavor, if anything can...[VAR 0114(0010)]
Now then...ready yourself! And I will summon our\nmighty Kleavor, Lord of the Woods.[VAR 0114(0010)]
I’m ready!
Let’s not be hasty
Are you serious?!\c\nAfter everything we readied for this moment,\nyou’re simply going to back out?! Outrageous![VAR 0114(0010)]
As am I![VAR 0114(0010)]
Oh mighty Kleavor, Lord of the Woods...\nThough it isn’t yet the time of ceremony, we’ve\r\nprepared an offering of your favorite things.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Benevolent lord who works his might between\nthe heavens and earth, we offer our gratitude.\c\nAnd beseech you—reveal yourself to our eyes...[VAR 0114(0010)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Listen well, [VAR 0100(0000)]—keep\nyour\r\nfocus\r\non Kleavor!\c\nDodging will be vital. Try to avoid his moves as\nyou’re throwing the balms![VAR 0114(000B)]
Graaashaaa!
Oh mighty Kleavor, Lord of the Woods...\nWe beseech you—reveal yourself to our eyes...[VAR 0114(0010)]
Stay focused on Kleavor! And when he tries to\nget you with a move, dodge out of the way![VAR 0114(000B)]
Come on! You’re the one with the best chance of\nusing these balms to the fullest![VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 315]
You received the Insect Plate from Kleavor!
Wh-what happened?![VAR 0114(0010)]
Some kind of light erupted from Kleavor’s body![VAR 0114(0010)]
Has Lord Kleavor’s frenzied mind truly been\nput at ease now?![VAR 0114(0010)]
Does this confirm that the strange lightning was\nto blame for Kleavor’s unnatural power?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Maybe...
I don’t know
Well...this is what I think, after all we’ve seen.[VAR 0114(000B)]
We know strange lightning came from out of the\nspace-time rift the other night...\c\nThose bolts must have struck Kleavor and driven\nhim into his frenzy after all.[VAR 0114(000B)]
The lightning came from the space-time rift?[VAR 0114(0010)]
But if almighty Sinnoh really does dwell beyond\nthat space-time rift, then the strange lightning...\r\nIt indeed was almighty Sinnoh’s power?![VAR 0114(0010)]
Then were we even right to try to interfere?\c\nI happily went along with this plan to create some\nbalms, as if I knew what I was doing—like some\r\nkind of thoughtless fool! Outrageous![VAR 0114(0010)]
Calm yourself, Lian.\c\nRemember that the Lord of the Woods has long\nbeen our protector, keeping the Pearl Clan safe\r\nfrom dangerous Pokémon that might harm us.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Would power sent by the true almighty Sinnoh\nhave driven Kleavor to turn on us and attack\r\npeople and Pokémon indiscriminately? I doubt it.\c\nWhat [VAR 0100(0000)] accomplished\njust\r\nnow...\r\nIt\r\nneeded\r\nto\r\nbe done.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m glad we could settle this without further strife\nwith the Diamond Clan or the Galaxy Team.\c\nIf you come across other Pokémon in the grip of\nthis painful frenzy, please help them.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Hrmmm... Yes. Fine. I suppose I must concur.\c\nI apologize for becoming briefly incomposed.\nI’m grateful for what you’ve done for my lord.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Please, take these—on behalf of the Pearl Clan.\c\nConsider it my apology for having spoken rudely\nto you earlier...and a token of my thanks.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Let me care for your Pokémon as well.\nIn appreciation for fighting on our behalf![VAR 0114(000B)]
I think I’ve finally come to believe that you truly\ndid fall out of the sky...\c\nThough I still cannot imagine the reasons at play.[VAR 0114(000B)]
And it seems we’ve settled things here.\nThough, between you and me...\c\nI wouldn’t mind seeing Lord Kleavor in such a\nfrenzy again. He was fearfully strong, after all![VAR 0114(0010)]
[~ 336]
I saw the light fading into the sky. You must have\nquelled the lord Pokémon![VAR 0114(000C)]
And what do you have there? Could it be...?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Ah! Those are two of the fabled plates of old!\nPlease, let me have a look![VAR 0114(000C)]
I see there are some letters carved into them.\nLet’s see. This one says...\c\n“Where all creation was born, that is the being’s\nplace of origin.”[VAR 0114(000C)]
It seems to be a phrase from a very old myth.\nHow did you come across these?[VAR 0114(000C)]
I see! So you were given the plates when you\nimpressed Wyrdeer and Kleavor?[VAR 0114(000C)]
That is quite something, indeed! My heart is\npractically racing with excitement![VAR 0114(000C)]
It is my guess that you will find more plates like\nthese scattered across Hisui!\c\nIf we were to gather them all and decipher the\nscripts on them, we may uncover something\r\nabsolutely amazing![VAR 0114(000C)]
The mysteries of the past! Oh, how they tickle\nmy curiosity! What a joy to be alive in such times!\r\nWell, I must be on my way. Until next time![VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 346]
Hrrrm. Well done![VAR 0114(0009)]
I have already received the reports of\nyour exploits.\c\nYou successfully quelled Kleavor’s frenzy,\nrestoring peace of mind to Hisui’s people.[VAR 0114(0009)]
You are a stranger to us—one who fell out of\nthe very sky. Yet you have served the Galaxy\r\nTeam admirably.\c\nI admit you have earned yourself some degree\nof recognition.[VAR 0114(0009)]
But things are not settled yet.\c\nI’ve received word that there are other Pokémon\nnobles falling prey to such frenzies elsewhere\r\nin Hisui.[VAR 0114(0009)]
So carry on with your research and survey duties,\nand prove that you truly are an asset to us![VAR 0114(0009)]
That is all. You are dismissed.\c\nYour fellow Survey Corps members are likely at\nthe Wallflower. Go and join them.[VAR 0114(0009)]
[~ 353]
Beni, old chum, the usual order! Three servings of\npotato mochi, please!\c\nOh, and if there’s anything else that you’d\nrecommend, by all means, bring it out![VAR 0114(0005)]
The whole village is gossiping up a storm about\nour young friend here, you know.\c\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe’s got quite some luck to have come back\nunharmed after facing off against that Kleavor.[VAR 0114(000E)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I daresay [VAR 0100(0000)] was\nwell prepared.\c\nAnd [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she was a quick study of how Kleavor moved\nin battle, from what I heard![VAR 0114(0005)]
All in all, it was a very good show! A victory\nwell earned![VAR 0114(0005)]
Going to work in the fieldlands should feel a lot\nsafer now, thanks to you, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
And if you want to feel even safer, try making\nsome of these! Beni taught me how to make ’em,\r\nso I wrote out his directions into a recipe.[VAR 0114(0006)]
We can feel safer going about our Survey Corps\nduties now, thanks to your efforts.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Oh, by the way—why not try crafting some of\nthese? I made the recipe based on directions\r\nBeni gave me.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Lovely!\c\nAnd now that we need not worry about being\nmauled by Kleavor, either...\c\nlet’s take our chance to study all the Pokémon\nthat call the Obsidian Fieldlands their home![VAR 0114(0005)]

The next day...
Wow! The Galaxy Team hairdresser really is...\ndare I say...cutting edge![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh, hey! You’re [VAR 0100(0000)],\nthe [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl\r\nwho\r\nquelled\r\nKleavor,\r\naren’t you?[VAR 0114(0004)]
That’s me!
Who’s to say...
I knew it! You’ve got quite the reputation,\nyou know.\c\nI mean, you quelled one of almighty Sinnoh’s\nchosen ones! Some people are actually kinda\r\nscared of you for doing something so bold.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Heh, you can’t fool me! You’ve got quite the\nreputation, you know.\c\nI mean, you quelled one of almighty Sinnoh’s\nchosen ones! Some people are actually kinda\r\nscared of you for doing something so bold.[VAR 0114(0004)]
I’m Arezu, by the way!\c\nI’m a warden of the Diamond Clan. My special\nskill is giving haircuts. Real nice to meet you![VAR 0114(0012)]
Oh snip! But I came here to talk to your\nMr. Kamado. See you round![VAR 0114(0012)]
[~ 9]
Hrrrm... So it’s come to Ursaluna as well...[VAR 0114(0009)]
This suggests that even Pokémon that are not\nnobles can become frenzied...[VAR 0114(0009)]
I have received no word from Adaman or Irida...\nBut this is not something we can simply ignore.[VAR 0114(0009)]
In any case, you have my thanks, Miss Arezu. You\ndid well to inform us of Ursaluna’s situation.[VAR 0114(0009)]
No problem! Adaman’s got his hands full running\nour clan and all, and Ursaluna’s warden wouldn’t\r\neven give me the time of day...\c\nSo the Galaxy Team are the only ones I could\nturn to about this.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Ursaluna’s warden is Mistress Calaba of the\nPearl Clan, is it not?[VAR 0114(0009)]
Of all the wardens, she is the most narrow-\nminded— Ahem! Bound by tradition.\r\nShe likely does not take kindly to outsiders\r\nmeddling in her affairs.[VAR 0114(0009)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I have a new mission for you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nI order you to study Ursaluna in the Crimson\nMirelands! I permit you to show your strength\r\nif necessary![VAR 0114(0009)]
You just quelled a lord, and they don’t even give\nyou a moment to breathe, huh? Well, I’ll be at\r\nthe hairdresser if you need me.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I trust you are making progress with your work.\nMake sure to report to Cyllene regularly.[VAR 0114(0009)]
[~ 20]
The next area you will be sent to investigate is\nthe Crimson Mirelands.[VAR 0114(0008)]
You will find the Pokémon living there to be more\nfearsome than those in the Obsidian Fieldlands.\c\nEven the landscape itself is harsher, with steep\nravines and seaside cliffs. It is not welcoming.[VAR 0114(0008)]
You must be a Second Star to face the mirelands.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Complete research tasks to help fill in the\nPokédex if you hope to move up in the ranks.\c\nDo so by catching Pokémon and conducting your\nsurvey work in areas you currently have access to.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 25]
Yes? Have you made progress on your\nresearch tasks?[VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 27]
At your current rank, you should be able to\nhandle the Crimson Mirelands on your own.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Here is what you need to know.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Your destination is a place within the mirelands\nknown as the Solaceon Ruins.\c\nThat is where you’ll find Ursaluna’s warden.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 31]
[~ 32]
[~ 33]
[~ 34]
[~ 35]
[~ 36]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Mind helping\nme\r\ntrain\r\na bit?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Sure, why not?
I’ve got a mission
Come on—don’t just hang me out to dry. I’ve got\nno one else to ask![VAR 0114(0006)]
That’s the stuff! I’ll feel a lot better going out\nresearching on my own if I can beat you.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh, hello, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0007)]
I was just getting the itch to battle with you, and\nnow here you are. It must be a sign![VAR 0114(0007)]
You’re right!
I’ve got a mission
Even after all I did to help you acclimate?\nI think you owe me at least this much...[VAR 0114(0007)]
Let’s have a fine battle, so I can grow closer\nwith Pikachu![VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 48]
Seems right that the one who could defeat a lord\nwould beat me, too, I guess![VAR 0114(0006)]
Whoa! Maybe Pikachu and I are getting better![VAR 0114(0006)]
Thanks for that battle. Here—let me give you a\nnew recipe.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Y’know, lately these [VAR FF00(0006)]space-time distortion[VAR FF00(0000)] things\nhave been popping up here and there.\c\nI took a peek into one and saw some tempting\nitems, so I tried ducking in to grab ’em.\c\nBut it turned out there were legions of tough\nPokémon inside. I barely made it out alive...\r\nYou be careful around those distortions, all right?\c\nAnyway! Time to make for the Mirelands Camp.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Pikachu may not be very happy with me\nafter that.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Wow—Pikachu and Mime Jr. did great! I’ll give\nthem some of their favorite Berries later as\r\na reward![VAR 0114(0007)]
Thank you for battling with me. Here—have this\nnew recipe.[VAR 0114(0007)]
So I’ve been working on studying those strange\n[VAR FF00(0006)]space-time distortions[VAR FF00(0000)].\c\nDo you know the ones I mean? They’ve been\nappearing here and there lately.\c\nIt seems like they hold wonderful items—but\nfrightfully strong Pokémon, too. If you plan to go\r\ninto one, be careful about it!\c\nNow, time to head to the Mirelands Camp.[VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 57]
Here we are, my [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl! The Crimson Mirelands!\nAn area teeming with poison-wielding Pokémon\r\nand plenty of others besides![VAR 0114(0005)]
Seems like you’re in for a tough mission. I’m sure\nyou can handle it, though.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh, that’s right! You’re heading to the Solaceon\nRuins, aren’t you?\c\nThey’re off that way, if you need a pointer.\nSee the entrance way over there?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Y’know, I wish we could tell where or when one\nof those space-time distortions was going to\r\nerupt... I wonder if checking your map would help.[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I’ve heard about your mission,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nIf you’re looking for the Solaceon Ruins, they’re\noff that way.[VAR 0114(0007)]
For now, I’ll keep searching for those space-time\ndistortions. There’s little way of knowing when or\r\nwhere one might appear, but I’ll do my best!\c\nIt sure would be handy if my map could tell me...[VAR 0114(0007)]
I’m counting on both of you to carry out your\nsurvey work as best you can! But be mindful of\r\nyour limitations as well, won’t you?\c\nIf wild Pokémon are giving you trouble, I suggest\nyou go to the training grounds and have Captain\r\nZisu teach your Pokémon some strong moves.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 65]
I’m Calaba of the Pearl Clan. Warden Calaba\nto you.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Ho? Now would you look at that... You have a\nCelestica Flute.[VAR 0114(0011)]
You must be the one they say fell out of the\nspace-time rift.[VAR 0114(0011)]
That’s right
I guess?
I see, I see...[VAR 0114(0011)]
Why the vague response, hmmm? Something\nto hide?[VAR 0114(0011)]
I’ve already heard about you. That you quelled\nKleavor in his frenzy.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I’m sure many people were saved by your\nactions, but I wonder if there wasn’t some other\r\nway to handle the situation...[VAR 0114(0011)]
What you did is hardly different from bullying a\nPokémon into submission, after all.\c\nAnd you run about catching Pokémon up in those\nlittle balls you carry...[VAR 0114(0011)]
I don’t need any help from your sort. Or the\nDiamond Clan, for that matter.\c\nThat young lady, Arezu, offered to help, but\nassociating with the Diamond Clan...\r\nIt just won’t do.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Be on your way.\c\nThere is much I must do, and I’d prefer not to be\ndistracted any further.[VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Ah, [VAR 0100(0000)]! How about\nyou\r\nshow\r\nme\r\nthe\r\nstrength\r\nthat\r\ncould\r\nquell\r\neven\r\na\r\nfrenzied lord?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Gladly!
A bit busy right now...
Who knows when I’ll get the chance next?\nPlease, I ask that you face me now![VAR 0114(000C)]
A battle with you might let me experience even\na fraction of the power the nobles wield![VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 83]
Such prodigious strength! Now, let me just heal\nup your Pokémon...[VAR 0114(000C)]
Well now! I think that settles it.\c\nI must ask your help in retrieving the stolen Wall\nFragment. With your skill, it should be a cinch![VAR 0114(000C)]
Wall Fragment?
Wait—stolen?
Yes, exactly!\c\nSome bandits pillaged the Solaceon Ruins and\nmade off with a fragment of the wall engravings![VAR 0114(000C)]
Have you not heard of the notorious\nMiss Fortunes?\c\nThey’re a trio of bandits that have even hit us\nGinkgo Guild merchants more than a few times!\r\nNot the kind of regulars I like to have, let me\r\ntell you![VAR 0114(000C)]
Mistress Calaba is doing everything she can to\nregain the fragment, but at 99 years old...\c\nIt’s a bit hard for her to chase leads all over\nthe place.[VAR 0114(000C)]
So what do you say, kind [VAR 1100(00FF,0503)]sirmadam? Why not help\nfind the fragment for the warden?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Oh—naturally I’ll be happy to lend you a hand!\c\nThose sisters swiped my wares, too, and I’m no\nGinkgo Guild merchant if I take that lying down![VAR 0114(000C)]
And far be it from me to let them just get away\nwith vandalizing the precious ruins of this region![VAR 0114(000C)]
You know, I did see the remains of a campfire\nnear the Mirelands Camp. Perhaps worth\r\nchecking out?[VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 95]
It’s a burned-out campfire. Somebody must have\nbeen here...
Now who might you be? Not some stray traveler,\nfrom the look of you.[VAR 0114(0004)]
There’s only one reason people go poking\naround out here in the middle of nowhere.\c\nYou’re after us three, aren’t you?![VAR 0114(0004)]
Sisters, we should introduce ourselves properly...\c\nbefore we show this poor fool how wrong [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she\nwas to assume [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she could ever beat us.[VAR 0114(0004)]
I bring good luck to my sisters wherever I go—\nand ill luck to anyone who crosses our paths.\c\nI’m the eldest, and I’ll be your unlucky Charm![VAR 0114(0022)]
Thought you spotted a four-leaf clover? Well, I’ll\nsoon have you seeing double!\c\nI’m the middle sister, and I’m one Clover you\ncan’t pick![VAR 0114(0023)]
Heads, I win, and tails, you lose—you’ve got no\nchance in this game of fortunes.\c\nI’m the youngest, Coin, but I’m definitely not\nyour good-luck piece.[VAR 0114(0024)]
We’re the infamous bandit trio, the Miss Fortune\nsisters—and your luck’s just run out!
Let me handle this, sisters. I’ll only hurt h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer\na little.[VAR 0114(0024)]
Come on, Toxicroak. Let’s douse this fool\nin poison![VAR 0114(0024)]
[~ 106]
Hmph. The Galaxy Team continues to spoil things\nfor me, even after I’ve left.\c\nTake the blasted fragment and go. Just leave\nus alone![VAR 0114(0024)]
The weird writing on it made us think the stupid\nthing was some kinda treasure.\c\nBut it turned out to be a worthless slab of junk.\nTch! All that effort for nothing![VAR 0114(0023)]
Tell me—why were you even seeking us out?\nWhat set you on this path?[VAR 0114(0022)]
I wanted to help Calaba
I wanted to help Ursaluna
Goodness, how selfless of you—to go so far out\nof your way for the sake of another.[VAR 0114(0022)]
Not all of us have the luxury of offering such\nunthinking kindness to strangers.\c\nFor some of us, simply surviving another day\ntakes all that we have.[VAR 0114(0022)]
And I’ve got a score to settle with the Galaxy\nTeam...which now includes you![VAR 0114(0022)]
Remember what those ancient verses tell us...\c\n“Why is it, in days of spring,\nbeneath the soft caress of the sun,\r\nthe blossoms tremble and fall,\r\nspirits lashed by uncertainty?”\c\nYour days are also numbered, Galaxy fool.[VAR 0114(0022)]
[~ 116]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Good work, very good work indeed,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nYou got the fragment back safe and sound![VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m well aware of Calaba’s reputation—they say\nshe’s stubborn, too old-fashioned, and so on...[VAR 0114(000C)]
But she’s given the Pearl Clan all she has, ever\nsince she was young. She lived her prime years\r\nhere in the Hisui region, trusting in the guidance\r\nof almighty Sinnoh.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I don’t think it’s that she hates the Diamond Clan\nor the Galaxy Team—rather, I think she simply\r\nloves the Pearl Clan very, very much.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Anyway, I do hope you’re able to calm Ursaluna’s\nfrenzy, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nA raging Pokémon in the area definitely isn’t\ngood for business, I assure you.[VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 122]
Oh, so you’ve come to bother me again?\nWell, come as often as you’d like, but it won’t\r\nchange my mind.[VAR 0114(0011)]
This Wall Fragment...
Those three bandits...
What? You went and retrieved the fragment\nfrom those bandits?\c\nWhy go out of your way like that for a complete\nstranger like me?[VAR 0114(0011)]
I guess you’re that eager to calm Ursaluna, hmm?[VAR 0114(0011)]
That’s right
If possible
I’ll admit, I didn’t expect anybody else to truly\ncare for Ursaluna...\c\nWell then, let’s see that Wall Fragment.[VAR 0114(0011)]

Let me read what it says.[VAR 0114(0011)]
“All lives touch other lives to create something\nanew and alive...”[VAR 0114(0011)]
...I see.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I suppose it means people helping each other,\nlike how you helped retrieve the fragment.\c\nI’ve read this passage many, many times. But this\nis the first time I’ve truly understood what it\r\nmeans. Maybe this is almighty Sinnoh’s guidance?[VAR 0114(0011)]
What is your name, then, [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl?[VAR 0114(0011)]
I see... [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nPlease lend me your strength, so that we may\nhelp Ursaluna.[VAR 0114(0011)]
It’s true that Ursaluna has become enraged,\nbut he doesn’t seem to be in an utter frenzy.\c\nI think he will return to his normal state if we can\njust give him some medicine.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I could never bring myself to engage Pokémon\nin battle...\c\nBut that’s something I can rely on you for,\nam I right?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Ursaluna prefers to stay on Sludge Mound.\nPlease join me there when you’re ready.[VAR 0114(0011)]
[~ 142]
Over here, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0011)]
Ursaluna is enraged, yes, but...he must still recall\nhis long relationship with the Pearl Clan.\c\nHe never fails to show up the moment I play my\nCelestica Flute.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Rrragh!
Now, show your mettle to Ursaluna!\c\nBut remember that Ursaluna is a Pokémon very\ndear to the Pearl Clan. I will not permit you to\r\ncatch him![VAR 0114(0011)]
Wargh!
Oh my. Scared, are you?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Ursaluna, my poor darling. You must be\nexhausted from running around like that.\r\nCome. Let me make you all better.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Ursaluna’s quite strong, isn’t he? Maybe you\nought to prepare a bit more.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I have here a special medicine of the Pearl Clan.\c\nIt’ll clear out any poison in a Pokémon’s body.\nIf poison’s what’s causing Ursaluna’s rage, this is\r\nsure to calm him down. We call it...Toxi-Gone![VAR 0114(0011)]
Bleeeeeegh!
It’s so potent that we can only use it on tough,\nresilient Pokémon, like Ursaluna.\c\nThere, there, dear Ursaluna. You’ve calmed down\nnow, haven’t you?[VAR 0114(0011)]
This is all very strange, though...[VAR 0114(0011)]
He wasn’t glowing
He wasn’t really frenzied
Very astute of you, Galaxy Team recruit.\c\nYou’re exactly right. When you quelled Kleavor’s\nfrenzy, I could see the strange light rising into the\r\nsky all the way from here.[VAR 0114(0011)]
But no such strange light erupted from Ursaluna\nafter you defeated him, nor was he glowing.[VAR 0114(0011)]
And what is this clinging to Ursaluna’s coat?\nIt seems like some kind of powder...[VAR 0114(0011)]
That girl from the Diamond Clan, Arezu...\nNow, why did she of all people find the need to\r\ncome and tell me about Ursaluna, I wonder?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Oh, but I almost forgot something important.\c\nPlay your Celestica Flute for me, won’t you?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Ursaluna opened his heart and learned well the\nsound of your playing!
You can now call Ursaluna and dig for treasure!
You received the Earth Plate from Ursaluna!
Ursaluna is very good at finding things that are\nburied in the ground.\c\nWe say that he’s digging for treasure, even if\nthese treasures might not always glitter or gleam.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Now go and let your commander know of what\ntranspired here, child of the Galaxy Team.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Burrr...
[~ 168]
You’re back! Get to the commander’s\noffice, quick![VAR 0114(0006)]
There you are! You’d better hurry to the\ncommander’s office![VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 171]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! We have a situation here![VAR 0114(000E)]
Let me explain.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Lilligant, our clan’s Lady of the Ridge, is in\na frenzy...\c\nAnd Arezu knowingly kept this from me![VAR 0114(000A)]
The Lady of...what?
A Lilligant?
Yes—there are only female Lilligant, which makes\nthis honored one our Lady of the Ridge.[VAR 0114(000A)]
But this isn’t the time for cultural lessons!\c\nI’d like to find out just what Arezu was thinking,\nbut she’s nowhere in Jubilife Village.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Last I saw, she was at the Wallflower, polishing\noff a big ol’ plate of potato mochi.\c\nNot that I blame her—my cooking is simply\nirresistible, after all.[VAR 0114(000E)]
If Arezu of the Diamond Clan was somehow\ninvolved in that situation with the raging Ursaluna\r\nof the Pearl Clan, it could lead to the two clans\r\ngoing at each other’s throats again![VAR 0114(0009)]
Tell me, Commander. If we do end up in a struggle\nwith the Pearl Clan, what will your people do?[VAR 0114(000A)]
We would be forced to remain neutral...[VAR 0114(0009)]
Meaning what?[VAR 0114(000A)]
If we were to show support for one side, it\nwould put us at odds with the other.\c\nWe came here to create a home for ourselves,\nnot to take part in tearing the land apart...[VAR 0114(0009)]
Right. Of course...\c\nAfter all the work you’ve put in to get us to treat\none another as equals and keep us from fighting...\c\nI suppose it’s no surprise you’d refuse to\nintervene if trouble were to break out again.[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], perhaps you have\nsome\r\nidea\r\nhow\r\nwe\r\nmight\r\naddress\r\nthis situation?[VAR 0114(0009)]
I could call Ursaluna
Not really
Ursaluna? So he and Warden Calaba found you\nworthy? That’s perfect, then.\c\nUrsaluna should be able to sniff out Arezu,\nwherever she’s gone.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I know—why don’t we call in Ursaluna? He has a\nkeen nose for tracking.[VAR 0114(000A)]
If you are strong enough that Ursaluna deemed\nyou worthy, then you should be ready to quell\r\nLilligant’s frenzy as well.[VAR 0114(0009)]
I’ll head to Lilligant’s seat, then—Brava Arena,\nit’s called. If you’ll excuse me![VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Listen well, [VAR 0100(0000)]. You must\nquell\r\nany\r\nPokémon\r\nthat\r\ncould\r\ncause\r\nharm\r\nto the\r\npeople\r\nof Hisui.\c\nAlways remember: we came here to make a new\nhome where we could live without war or strife.[VAR 0114(0009)]
[~ 194]
That girl who set out earlier must’ve been eating\nsome of Beni’s potato mochi.\c\nI could still smell them on her.
That reminds me—I’ve seen Mistress Calaba\nriding around on that Ursaluna she serves,\r\ndigging for treasure in the ground.\c\nI wonder if Ursaluna uses his sense of smell to\nsuss out where treasure might be?
[~ 197]
Ursaluna now knows Arezu’s scent. Follow the\nblue signals to find her!
[~ 199]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh, [VAR 0100(0000)]... How did it all go\nwith Ursaluna?[VAR 0114(0012)]
I helped him
I calmed him down
Thanks a bunch, [VAR 1100(00FF,0405)]fellagirl. But...how’d you find me\nall the way out here?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Wow, you really are strong. But...how’d you find\nme all the way out here?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Ursaluna found you
From the potato mochi
He tracked me all the way here by the scent of\nthose potato mochi I ate?\c\nThat Ursaluna sure is something. I know he’s\ndescended from one of the Pokémon that were\r\nblessed by almighty Sinnoh...but still, wow![VAR 0114(0012)]
You followed the scent of the potato mochi I\nbought at the Wallflower?\c\nMan, I wish I could eat some more of those right\nnow... Jubilife Village sure was a lot of fun.[VAR 0114(0012)]
My luck’s run out, though...as you can most\nlikely tell.\c\nI got chased by a Pokémon and sprained my\nankle pretty bad as I was running away.\r\nIt’s almost like the world wants to punish me...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Ahhh, there you are. Arezu, right?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Eeek![VAR 0114(0012)]
M-Mistress Calaba! Uh, I-I-I didn’t—[VAR 0114(0012)]
I owe you an apology.\c\nI treated you with disrespect, thinking you were\njust some whelp from the Diamond Clan.\r\nI’m sorry for that. I should’ve treated you better.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Huh? Wait. But...[VAR 0114(0012)]
It’s not your fault that Lilligant became frenzied\nnor that my Ursaluna was so enraged. You were\r\ntrying to help them both, weren’t you?[VAR 0114(0011)]
I didn’t even have the courtesy to listen to you.\nYou’d think someone who’s lived as long as I\r\nhave would be more patient.[VAR 0114(0011)]
It’s OK... I didn’t do a good job explaining\nmyself, either.\c\nUrsaluna only started acting weird after he got\ntoo close to Lilligant and smelled her perfume.\c\nShe was already frenzied by that point, so I’m\nsure that’s what caused it...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Ah, that explains the strange powder I found on\nUrsaluna. It must’ve been powder from Lilligant.\c\nBut what happened to your leg, dear?[VAR 0114(0011)]
I was gathering ingredients to make balms...\nBut I...I fell and sprained my ankle.[VAR 0114(0012)]
See, the reason I went to Jubilife was to get help\nfor Ursaluna and also learn about crafting.[VAR 0114(0012)]
But while I was there, I bumped into Professor\nLaventon, and he told me about the balms you\r\nused to quell Kleavor.\c\nSo I thought I’d make some for Lilligant using her\nfavorite foods...[VAR 0114(0012)]
You Galaxy people know all sorts of things.\nI’d like to learn even more from you, really...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Well, then we’d better take care of our lady and\nget all this mess resolved first![VAR 0114(000A)]
Adaman![VAR 0114(0012)]
What were you thinking, doing all this yourself?\nDid you think I couldn’t help you?\c\nThough...no one would blame you for thinking so.\nNot much of a leader, am I? I’ve never even seen\r\nalmighty Sinnoh with my own eyes.\c\nAnd I failed to imagine that Lilligant might have\nbecome frenzied, too...[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Listen up, [VAR 0100(0000)]! I’ll take the\nbalms\r\nthat\r\nArezu\r\nmade\r\nand\r\nmeet\r\nyou\r\nat Brava Arena![VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Don’t you worry, Arezu.\n[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nwill\r\ncalm\r\nLilligant,\r\nand\r\nthat\r\nwill\r\nbe\r\nthat.\r\nThings\r\nshould\r\nsettle down.[VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Head to Brava Arena, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nThat’s\r\nwhere\r\nLilligant’s\r\nseat lies.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Arezu will be taken care of. My dear Bibarel and I\nwill make sure she reaches her lady.[VAR 0114(0011)]
You’re all so kind...[VAR 0114(0012)]
[~ 231]
So, you’ve come. I take it that means\nyou’re ready?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Of course!
Hold on a bit
Fair enough—you are going up against a noble.\nYou ought to prepare all you can.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Lady Lilligant’s a sight to see, even in her frenzy.\nBehold her, and be grateful![VAR 0114(000A)]
I hope we didn’t keep you waiting.[VAR 0114(0011)]
All it took was one of my poultices to get Arezu’s\nleg all patched up.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Calaba, ma’am. I’m deeply sorry we’ve had to\nlean on your help so much—especially as we’re\r\nfrom different clans.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Arezu tried to solve the whole situation herself.\c\nI daresay she bit off more than she could chew\nand caused some trouble, but her heart was in\r\nthe right place.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Listen! The Lady of the Ridge, Lilligant, is like a\ndancer—always in motion, always darting about.\c\nYou’ll wanna watch her real close and learn how\nto dodge her moves![VAR 0114(0012)]
That’s right. If you keep on dodging, she might\nget tired out—and that’ll be your opening!\c\nThat’s when you can bring out your own Pokémon\nand prove your might. Don’t let me down![VAR 0114(000A)]
[~ 243]
You received the Meadow Plate from Lilligant!
Hey—thank you.\c\nYou didn’t just save Lilligant—you saved Arezu\nas well. I appreciate it.[VAR 0114(000A)]
First Ursaluna and now Lilligant! You’re amazing,\nyou know that?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Being all frenzied didn’t suit Lilligant one bit.\nI’m so happy she’s back to her graceful self.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Liiilll...
Arezu! You still owe someone an apology.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Huh?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Oh, don’t worry about it.\c\nA young one like her is bound to get caught up in\nsome trouble from time to time.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Remember what’s written in the Solaceon Ruins?\n“All lives touch other lives to create something\r\nanew and alive.”\c\nThere’s wisdom in those words... I imagine they’re\nthe teaching of almighty Sinnoh itself.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Of course, I’d completely forgotten about them\nuntil a certain somebody helped me remember.[VAR 0114(0011)]
We owe you one, ma’am.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Don’t try to solve everything by yourself, Arezu.\c\nYou’re a warden. Of all people, we should\nknow how to stand in solidarity with others.\r\nIt’s our job to stand side by side with Pokémon,\r\nafter all.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Yes, I know... I’m sorry...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Well, I can hardly start yelling at you now after\nCalaba wrapped all that up so nicely.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Just one more thing, Arezu. I know you were\ntrying to do what you thought was right, and I\r\napprove of that.\c\nBut from now on, do it without keeping things\nfrom me. Agreed?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Other than that, no need to change a thing.\c\nExcept maybe to put in some training! If anything\nelse happens to Lilligant, I need you ready to\r\nprotect her like the warden you are![VAR 0114(000A)]
I understand...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Let’s work together from now on to keep the\nmirelands safe, Arezu.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I’ll be sure to inform Irida that both the Diamond\nClan and Galaxy Team helped save Ursaluna.[VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You did well, [VAR 0100(0000)]. All our\ndifferent\r\ngroups\r\nfinally\r\njoined\r\nhands\r\nto work\r\ntogether today.\c\nI admit, it was a fun day for me. But now it’s\nabout time I be on my way.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Listen. You know me—I’m Adaman, leader of the\nDiamond Clan, and I worship almighty Sinnoh,\r\nthe ruler of time.\c\nTime is all about change, and we can’t live in fear\nof that—we can only try to help the time we live\r\nin change for the better.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Something tells me helping you folks out will help\nme do that. I’m looking forward to it![VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Thank you for everything,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nI\r\nthink\r\nI’ll\r\nstay\r\nand\r\ntalk\r\nto\r\nLilligant\r\nfor\r\na while.[VAR 0114(0012)]
What happened, Lilligant? How’d a kindhearted\nPokémon like you end up all frenzied, huh?\c\nThough it’s not like I’m perfect... I hid things\nand lied and couldn’t even keep you safe.\r\nI’m real sorry about everything...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Liiidiii...
[~ 269]
You’re a real wonder!\c\nI saw light disappearing into the space-time rift.\nQuelled another frenzied Pokémon, have you?[VAR 0114(000C)]
We still don’t know what’s causing the lightning\nthat frenzies these Pokémon...\c\nBut you! You just go on rescuing them, without\neven a hint of trepidation![VAR 0114(000C)]
You might even change the entire course of\nhistory here in Hisui...\c\nAnd I definitely want to be in the good books\nof someone like that! Let’s stay in touch, friend![VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 273]
Found her by the scent of my mochi, did you?\nOf course you did.\c\nWhen you have my level of skill, your handiwork\ncan be recognized from a mile away.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Remember to be thankful for getting to eat such\nmasterful mochi when you come for dinner later.[VAR 0114(000E)]
But first, don’t you owe Kamado a report?\nYour meal can wait.[VAR 0114(000E)]
[~ 277]
So you successfully calmed Lilligant.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Excellent.[VAR 0114(0009)]
There may well be times when the Galaxy Team\nwill be forced to fight against Pokémon, but it is\r\nall for the sake of creating a new home for\r\nourselves, free from war and strife![VAR 0114(0009)]
...A stranger falls into our world from a rift in\nspace-time...\c\nThen frenzies are induced by strange lightning,\nwhich likewise falls from that very same rift...[VAR 0114(0009)]
But you have no connection to the lightning.\nIsn’t that right?\c\nWe may need to investigate the rift itself to\nprove your motives are beyond impugning.[VAR 0114(0009)]
[~ 283]
There you go. Piping-hot potato mochi, fresh\nfrom the stove.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Now this is the life, eh? Enjoying tasty potato\nmochi with friends, sharing the latest findings\r\nfrom our Pokémon research, and topping it all\r\noff with a good night’s sleep...\c\nTruly, who could ask for anything more![VAR 0114(0005)]
Sure, it’s nice... Yet I keep doing the same thing\nday after day. Is it really getting us anywhere?\r\nWith our research or with carving out a life here?[VAR 0114(0006)]
I don’t disagree... Yet I keep doing the same thing\nday after day—is it really getting us anywhere?\r\nWith our research or with carving out a life here?[VAR 0114(0007)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh, right—have this flashy new recipe,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nIt\r\nought\r\nto\r\nscatter\r\nthese\r\ngloomy thoughts.[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Ah, well. Here’s a flashy new recipe to try,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nIt’s\r\nfor\r\nan\r\nitem\r\nthat\r\nshould\r\nhelp\r\nscatter\r\nthese\r\ngloomy thoughts.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Come now—don’t worry yourself so, my [VAR 1100(00FF,0304)]girlboy![VAR 0114(0005)]
As a wise man once said, “Trust in yourself, and\nyou will find your way.”\c\nThese words are worth taking to heart! As long as\nwe truly believe in ourselves, I’m sure we’ll even\r\ncomplete that Pokédex of ours someday![VAR 0114(0005)]

Text File : chap_04

The next day...
Mornin’, sleepyhead![VAR 0114(0012)]
You’ll never guess what!\c\nI’m gonna start working at the hairdresser’s shop![VAR 0114(0012)]
Now you’ll be able to try out my own original\nhairstyles! Isn’t that super exciting?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Oh, I’m still gonna be Lilligant’s warden and all.\nI’ll be burnin’ the candle at both ends, but I can\r\nmake it work—don’t you worry![VAR 0114(0012)]
Anyway, come on over to the hairdresser’s when\nyou can, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nI’ll give you a killer hairstyle![VAR 0114(0012)]
I am pleased that you have found a worthy\nsuccessor for your establishment, Edith.[VAR 0114(0009)]
M-Mr. Kamado, sir... Errr...so about that whole\nUrsaluna situation...[VAR 0114(0012)]
If you are to work here in Jubilife Village, you\nare family to us, no matter who you are or where\r\nyou’re from. Welcome, Arezu.[VAR 0114(0009)]
And you, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nYou will come with me.[VAR 0114(0009)]
To Prelude Beach![VAR 0114(0009)]
[~ 11]
These people have just arrived here in Hisui.\nThey will live together with us in Jubilife Village.[VAR 0114(0009)]
When we of the Galaxy Team first arrived in\nthis land, we came ashore on Prelude Beach.\c\nIt is where everything began. This is where a new\nlife for all of you will begin as well.[VAR 0114(0009)]
We’ve heard that the Hisui region is inhabited by\nmany powerful and frightening Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0097)]
But we’ve also heard the Galaxy Team knows a\ngreat deal about Pokémon and uses their\r\nmysterious powers to help Jubilife Village grow.[VAR 0114(0041)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Indeed, you have both heard correctly!\c\nAnd the reason such tales have reached your\nears is largely thanks to [VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nhere,\r\none of\r\nour Survey\r\nCorps recruits.\c\nThrough the combined efforts of all our team\nmembers, let us continue to develop our village\r\nand thrive here in the Hisui region.[VAR 0114(0009)]
We look forward to doing our part, Commander.[VAR 0114(0097)]
The advancement of our understanding of\nPokémon—thanks to the Survey Corps—has\r\nexpanded the areas where we can operate safely.\c\nThat is what allows us to welcome in newcomers\nlike them.[VAR 0114(0009)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]... You truly do love\nPokémon,\r\ndon’t you?[VAR 0114(0009)]
I do
Not really...
Hrrrm... Pokémon have done grave injury to many\nof our fellows in the Galaxy Team...\c\nAnd yet you still find love for these creatures in\nyour heart. I suppose that is a necessary quality\r\nfor one in the Survey Corps.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Hrrrm... You have no love for them, and still you\ngo out to learn more about them.\c\nYou are a strange one, to be sure. But if you do\nwhat is asked of you, then I care not.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Remember this, though: Pokémon are\nterrifying creatures.[VAR 0114(0009)]
It is imperative that we study them and learn\nall that we can about them, whether we wish to\r\nlive alongside them...or not.[VAR 0114(0009)]
And be warned... As the leader of the Galaxy\nTeam, I am prepared to make harsh decisions in\r\norder to protect Jubilife Village.[VAR 0114(0009)]
’Scuse me, Boss. Irida from the Pearl Clan’s here.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Commander? Irida from the Pearl Clan’s arrived.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Good. I believe I know what she’s here about.[VAR 0114(0009)]
As for you, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nYou should see for yourself how Jubilife Village is\nchanging thanks to the Survey Corps’ efforts.\c\nThen you will come to my office.[VAR 0114(0009)]
[~ 31]
I commend you on your successful research of\nthe Pokémon living in the Crimson Mirelands.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Your next orders are to begin the survey of the\nCobalt Coastlands.[VAR 0114(0009)]
I will let you know in advance—there are no\nPokémon nobles in the Cobalt Coastlands.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Allow me to explain.[VAR 0114(000B)]
We did have a lord in the coastlands...until a few\nyears ago. A tragedy took him from us.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Now, we’ve had reports of people seeing\nstrange, shadowy figures on the island the lord\r\nused to call his home.[VAR 0114(0009)]
We have also received word from both the\nSecurity Corps and Supply Corps. It seems some\r\nof their members were attacked by a ghost while\r\nout gathering materials around Firespit Island.[VAR 0114(0009)]
These are serious concerns—and moreover,\nmy clan just can’t tolerate this desecration of our\r\nlate lord’s seat!\c\nNormally, I’d entrust this to our warden in the\ncoastlands, but her situation is...complicated.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I trust my intentions are clear by now. I hereby\norder you to investigate these reports.[VAR 0114(0009)]
I’ll meet you in the Cobalt Coastlands. I do love\nit there—it’s a beautiful area.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh, and...I know this must be a bewildering\nsituation to be dropped into.\r\nI’m sorry, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Think nothing of it.\n[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nis a\r\ntalented\r\nand\r\nhard-working\r\nmember\r\nof the\r\nGalaxy\r\nTeam.\r\nI’m sure\r\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she will\r\nsort\r\nthings out.[VAR 0114(0009)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Indeed. [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)] quelled\nthe\r\nLord\r\nof the\r\nWoods.\r\nI’ve seen\r\nboth h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser\r\nstrength\r\nand h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser\r\nkindness firsthand.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 45]
The next area for you to investigate will be the\nCobalt Coastlands.[VAR 0114(0008)]
It is farther afield than the Crimson Mirelands—\nmuch farther—and the path is long and trying.[VAR 0114(0008)]
You must be at least a Third Star in our ranks\nto be able to tackle the coastlands.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Strive to defeat Pokémon in battles, and observe\nthem using particular moves in your survey work.\c\nWork on such research tasks to ready yourself.\nAnd help with any requests that may have been\r\nposted on the professor’s blackboard in his lab.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 50]
Yes? Have you made progress on your\nresearch tasks?[VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 52]
With your current rank, you should be capable\nof braving the Cobalt Coastlands.[VAR 0114(0008)]
You know your mission. Investigate Firespit Island.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 55]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Hrrrm! Allow me to reiterate your objective.\c\n[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], you must survey Firespit\nIsland,\r\nlocated\r\nin the\r\nCobalt Coastlands![VAR 0114(0009)]
[~ 57]
Ah, if it isn’t [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0010)]
Though I suppose it’s to be expected that I’d\nrun into you in the village.\c\nWhere are you going to study Pokémon next?[VAR 0114(0010)]
The Cobalt Coastlands
Firespit Island
Oh, the Cobalt Coastlands? Palina’s certainly in a\nbit of a situation over there.\c\nShe’s a warden, and yet she has no noble to\nsee to.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Oh, Firespit Island? Perhaps you’ll run into our\nPalina. She’s in a bit of a situation over there.\c\nShe’s a warden, and yet she has no noble to\nsee to.[VAR 0114(0010)]
There are even some people in the Pearl Clan\nthat speak ill of her, though not to her face.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Oh, but do forgive me. Perhaps I shouldn’t be\nairing dirty laundry. A piece of advice, then,\r\nas an apology for wasting your time![VAR 0114(0010)]
Some Pokémon are strongly affected by certain\nstones, which hold mysterious power.\c\nWith the right stone, you can even evolve\nsome Pokémon.\c\nYou need look no further than Kleavor for proof\nof that![VAR 0114(0010)]
What I’m trying to say is basically this: if you and\nthe Survey Corps want to learn all there is to\r\nknow about the Pokémon of this region...[VAR 0114(0010)]
then the stones you find throughout Hisui will\nbe very important.\c\nThere’s even a tale of a stone that contains the\npower of creation—the very same power\r\nalmighty Sinnoh used to create the universe![VAR 0114(0010)]
I trust you’ll take my advice to heart and not\nunderestimate how important stones can be.\c\nTo help grind this fact into you... Here. I’ll give\nyou some rather handy stones and things I found.[VAR 0114(0010)]
And should you want some stones that can help\nPokémon evolve, I believe the Ginkgo Guild has\r\nthem from time to time![VAR 0114(0010)]
[~ 71]
Ah, the Cobalt Coastlands! A simply lovely corner\nof Hisui! Sea and sky as far as the eye can see!\c\nWhat kinds of Pokémon await us here, I wonder?\nWater types? Or Flying types, perhaps? Oooh,\r\nI simply can’t wait to study them all![VAR 0114(0005)]
Now, I’m sure you’re just as excited as I am to\nresearch this area’s Pokémon, but let’s not forget\r\nthat you’ve a mission to accomplish!\c\nSo, any questions before you get started?[VAR 0114(0005)]
About Firespit Island...
About that warden...
Hmm...indeed. Firespit Island is an offshore\nvolcano—you’ll need to cross the sea to reach it.\r\nI’d advise you to speak to a fellow called Iscan.\c\nHe’s one of the Diamond Clan’s wardens and\nwill surely help you find your way.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Wardens, in fact!\c\nHere in the Cobalt Coastlands, you’ll find Palina\nof the Pearl Clan and Iscan of the Diamond Clan.\c\nPerhaps they’ll be of some help to you as you\ndig into those curious occurrences.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 78]
I do love the flute. It feels as if its tones carry to\nthe very ends of space.\c\nBut I am here, and so are you. So now I’m going\nto focus everything I have on battling you![VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m game!
Why?
I need to understand my weaknesses. Please do\nthis for me![VAR 0114(000B)]
Very good. You who have seen the vast space\nbeyond the rift... Here I come![VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 84]
Ah, now I feel better!\c\nThe world is vast...and I am small within it.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Thank you! Allow me to heal your Pokémon.[VAR 0114(000B)]
All right. With you... I think with you I can\nbe frank.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I can’t afford to look weak in front of the\nDiamond Clan’s leader or your commander,\r\nbut in truth...[VAR 0114(000B)]
I sometimes wonder how I’ve ended up with the\nburdens I bear.[VAR 0114(000B)]
You see, we have a warden in the coastlands—\na lovely woman named Palina.[VAR 0114(000B)]
But she tends no lord or lady. And she will not\nraise a successor to fill the late lord’s empty\r\nseat, either.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Some people have started to question her\nworthiness to be a warden at all.[VAR 0114(000B)]
But Lina—that is to say, Palina—she’s very dear\nto me, no matter what anyone might say.\c\nWe were both in the running to become leader of\nthe Pearl Clan. We strove to surpass one another,\r\nbut...she taught me a great deal, too.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Having said all this, I have a favor to ask of you.\c\nPlease help her raise the Pokémon she looks after\ninto a true heir to his father—the late lord![VAR 0114(000B)]
With the help of your strength, I think our late\nlord’s heir would grow into a worthy successor.\c\nAnd if he succeeds, it should silence\nLina’s naysayers.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I don’t know of anyone I’d trust more to help\nwith this than the person who helped the Pearl\r\nClan by quelling Kleavor’s frenzy![VAR 0114(000B)]
You’ll be able to find Lina up on the headland.\c\nHead down this hill, and turn left. You should\nfind a slope leading up onto the ridge.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 98]
Grawawa!
Hush, now. Settle down.[VAR 0114(0004)]
I’m Palina of the Pearl Clan. And who might\nyou be?[VAR 0114(0014)]
Ah, so you’re that child from the Galaxy Team.[VAR 0114(0014)]
I heard how you aided Kleavor and Lilligant\nwhen none other could quell their frenzy.\c\nYour strength must be amazing, and yet...\nyou have such a gentle face.[VAR 0114(0014)]
So, what brings you to the Cobalt Coastlands?\c\nWe have no lord here, much less a frenzied one\nfor you to quell.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Our previous lord...was swallowed by the waves.\c\nHe was rescuing his young pup that had been\nswept out to sea and ended up giving his life\r\nto ensure the pup’s safe return...[VAR 0114(0014)]
If you were to guess, which of these Growlithe\nwould you say is the previous lord’s child?[VAR 0114(0014)]
The big one?
The small one?
That’s what everyone says at first... But no.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Oh, you have quite a good eye.[VAR 0114(0014)]
This quiet, skittish Growlithe is the child of the\nprevious lord.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Bowww...
I’ve no doubt this little one has the potential to\nbe a fine lord, but witnessing his father’s demise\r\nhas left deep scars in his heart...[VAR 0114(0014)]
There are those who expect me to train him more\nstrictly and force lordship upon him before he is\r\nready...but I could never bring myself to do that.[VAR 0114(0014)]
No matter what the rest of the Pearl Clan says,\nmy mind is quite made up. I’ll stay by this little\r\none’s side and let him live his life as he wishes.[VAR 0114(0014)]
So, now that you know our situation, might I ask\nyour purpose in coming to the coastlands?[VAR 0114(0014)]
I’m here to help the heir
I make for Firespit Island
Ah. Did Irida ask you to intervene, perhaps?\c\nI appreciate the kind gesture, truly, but I’m afraid\nthis matter simply does not concern you.[VAR 0114(0014)]
A survey of Firespit Island? I see... There are\nrumors the place is haunted by strange shadows\r\nthese days.\c\nYou’ll need the aid of a Pokémon known as\nBasculegion if you wish to cross the sea.[VAR 0114(0014)]
You should speak to Iscan, a warden of the\nDiamond Clan. He should be able to help you.[VAR 0114(0014)]
There is definitely something strange happening\nout on Firespit Island...\c\nThose shadowy figures are concerning, of course,\nbut then there’s also the odd lightning that came\r\nfrom that rift in the sky...[VAR 0114(0014)]
Lightning is a sign that the heavens are angry...\nI worry that we may have offended almighty\r\nSinnoh somehow.[VAR 0114(0014)]
In the past, the Pearl Clan and Diamond Clan\nwere locked in conflict over which side revered\r\nthe true almighty Sinnoh...[VAR 0114(0014)]
Even if we’ve reached an uneasy peace, the true\nalmighty Sinnoh must be angered because there\r\nare still those who worship a false image of it.\c\nAh, but I digress... I do apologize.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Iscan lives on Aipom Hill, just past Ginkgo\nLanding. I imagine you’ll find him there.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Rowww...
[~ 128]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Why, hello there, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0302)]r.iss [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nFancy\r\nrunning\r\ninto\r\nyou\r\nout here![VAR 0114(000C)]
Me? Oh, I’m on the hunt for some plates!\nHow’s your plate hunting going, young friend?[VAR 0114(000C)]
So-so, I guess
Meh...
No need to be humble! I see you’ve already\ngot your hands on four plates![VAR 0114(000C)]
You gain plates when you quell frenzied nobles—\nand when a great Pokémon recognizes you as\r\nworthy of bearing, isn’t that right?[VAR 0114(000C)]
The way you’ve been collecting those plates...\nIt reminds me of the ancient hero.\c\nThe one that’s said to have battled against\nalmighty Sinnoh.[VAR 0114(000C)]
You know, I’ve been wondering...\c\nThe 10 Pokémon that are said to have followed\nthe ancient hero—their powers are supposed to\r\nhave come from almighty Sinnoh itself.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Why would they seek to challenge almighty\nSinnoh along with the hero, then?\c\nPerhaps we’ll get some answers once we gather\nall the plates?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Well, let’s both do our best to find more!\c\nBut please, don’t overexert yourself. I’d hate\nfor something to happen to one of our guild’s\r\nloyal customers![VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 139]
It seems as though nobody’s home...
Do...do I have a visitor?\c\nI-I’ll be right out... Give me a moment...[VAR 0114(0004)]
So, um...[VAR 0114(0004)]
I’m Iscan of...of the Diamond Clan...[VAR 0114(0004)]
A Galaxy Team member...with a Celestica Flute?\c\nO-oh. You must be [VAR 0100(0000)], right?\c\nH-have I done something to warrant your visit?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Well, sudden visits give me quite a shock...\nI do hope you’ll give me advanced notice in\r\nthe future.[VAR 0114(0013)]
So, um...why are you here?[VAR 0114(0013)]
To visit Firespit Island
I need Basculegion’s aid
So you...you want to go to Firespit Island?\c\nW-well, if you insist...then you’d probably need\nBasculegion’s favorite snack. That should help\r\nhelp him warm up to you.[VAR 0114(0013)]
But preparing his favorite... Oh... It’s, um, more\nthan a little difficult... More like an impossibly\r\nhigh hurdle... Or...really...just impossible, if I’m\r\nbeing honest...[VAR 0114(0013)]
How so?
Impossible?
I-I’ll tell you... I have the right materials, but...[VAR 0114(0013)]
But then you... Well, you see, this next part is\nsomething I could never manage, but you need\r\nto catch this one Pokémon that appears at night...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Go on
Which Pokémon?
Y-y-you really want to know? You...really don’t\nvalue your own life, do you?[VAR 0114(0013)]
It’s D...\c\nD...\c\nDus...\c\nDusclops...\c\nOooh, even saying its name fills me with dread...[VAR 0114(0013)]
So...the materials for the food...have to be\nimbued with flavor by Dusclops’s Dark Pulse...\c\nThat’s the only way you can make Basculegion’s\nfavorite food, you see...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Got it!
I’ll do it!
W-wow, is everyone in the Galaxy Team like you?\nYour nerves aren’t just steel... They’re...titanium.\c\nIt’s positively frightening how, um, fearless\nyou are.[VAR 0114(0013)]
D-Dus... Agh, I can’t say it... Well, the Pokémon\nI need has only one eye and can be found\r\nwandering around Deadwood Haunt...\c\nAh, Deadwood Haunt is the area that looks like\na hand on your map... You’ll know you’re there\r\nwhen you find the wrecked boats...\c\nI-I try very hard to avoid those one-eyed\nPokémon, and so now I know a lot about them,\r\nyou see...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Would...would you like to wait here until night,\nwhen that Pokémon appears...?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Yes, I’ll wait
No, I’ve got things to do
Well then...[VAR 0114(0013)]
D-Dus... Agh, I can’t say it... Well, the Pokémon\nI need has only one eye and can be found\r\nwandering around Deadwood Haunt...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Ah, Deadwood Haunt is the area that looks like\na hand on your map... You’ll know you’re there\r\nwhen you find the wrecked boats...[VAR 0114(0013)]
I-I try very hard to avoid those one-eyed\nPokémon, and so now I know a lot about them,\r\nyou see...[VAR 0114(0013)]
[~ 171]
D-did you bring it? You know... The Pokémon\nwith a name that sounds like, um, d-dust...bops...[VAR 0114(0013)]
You really brought it...? N-no! Don’t bring it out![VAR 0114(0013)]
Th-that, um, “dust bops”... I guess you don’t have\nit with you...[VAR 0114(0013)]
R-right...\c\nI guess...I guess I’ve got to do my part, seeing\nhow, um, determined you are...to go to that\r\nisland...with Basculegion...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Usually I, um, ask Palina if the Growlithe she\ntakes care of can help me with this bit.[VAR 0114(0013)]
But this time, you need to help since... Well,\nsince we’re making this snack so that you’ll be\r\naccepted by Basculegion.[VAR 0114(0013)]
O-once I give the signal, you...have that\n“dust bops” of yours use its Dark Pulse...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Three...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Two...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Waugh! No! It’s too frightening![VAR 0114(0013)]
Could you get a grip?
Come on—try again
Right... S-so counting down to it just makes the\nanticipation and terror worse... Let’s simply have\r\nyou do it when I say go...[VAR 0114(0013)]
And...go![VAR 0114(0013)]
A delicious aroma wafts through the air—\nBasculegion’s favorite snack is now ready!
Both the aroma and the shape are...perfect!\nIt’s the perfect ball of Basculegion Food!\c\nThen let us make for Ginkgo Landing. We can\nsummon Basculegion there...[VAR 0114(0013)]
[~ 188]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh, hello, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nI-I was\r\njust\r\nwaiting\r\nfor you...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Hello, Iscan.[VAR 0114(0014)]
O-oh, Palina! I...I thought you said we shouldn’t\nbe seen together?[VAR 0114(0013)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I’m sure [VAR 0100(0000)]\ncan\r\nkeep\r\na secret.\c\nBesides, both I and the Growlithe pups were\neager to meet with the great Basculegion again.[VAR 0114(0014)]
I see... Well in that case, let me\nsummon Basculegion.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Shraaa!
[VAR BD06(0000)]Go on, [VAR 0100(0000)]. You can\ngive\r\nthe\r\nfood\r\nto\r\nBasculegion now.[VAR 0114(0013)]
You threw in the ball of Basculegion Food!
Oh![VAR 0114(0013)]
Shraaa!
The great Basculegion...[VAR 0114(0014)]
O-oh... Thank goodness...\c\nI was a little worried about whether Basculegion\nwould accept this favor...[VAR 0114(0013)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]So, uh, [VAR 0100(0000)]... You should let\nBasculegion\r\nhear\r\nyour playing.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Basculegion opened his heart and learned well\nthe sound of your playing!
You can now call Basculegion and ride across\nthe water on his back!
You received the Splash Plate from Basculegion!
Now you can ride Basculegion across Tranquility\nCove and head to Firespit Island.[VAR 0114(0013)]
You should also know that Basculegion can jump\nfrom the water’s surface—and then jump once\r\nagain in the air to go even higher!\c\nYou can throw items from Basculegion’s\nback, too.[VAR 0114(0013)]
In your case, I guess that would mean throwing\nPoké Balls to catch Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Grawow!
[VAR BD06(0000)]My congratulations to you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0014)]
Rowrrr...
Palina... Do you want to tell h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer?[VAR 0114(0013)]
I mentioned to you before how the previous lord\nrescued his Growlithe pup.[VAR 0114(0014)]
During that incident, Iscan and Basculegion saved\nmy life as well.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Since then, I’ve felt a great deal of affection for\nIscan here. I truly adore him...\c\nBut I know there are those who speak ill of me\nbehind my back...[VAR 0114(0014)]
So I try to meet with Iscan where there are no\nprying eyes, to preserve his reputation.[VAR 0114(0014)]
W-well, I was just doing what any decent person\nwould do when I saved you...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Perhaps...but nonetheless. After that day, I found\nthe strength to accept Growlithe as he is and not\r\nforce him to become the next lord.\c\nAnd it was all thanks to the courage you showed\nme, Iscan.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Ah... Perhaps we should save this discussion for\nanother time, after all.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Rowrrr...
I bring good luck to my sisters wherever I go—\nand ill luck to anyone who crosses our paths.\c\nI’m the eldest, and I’ll be your unlucky Charm![VAR 0114(0022)]
Thought you spotted a four-leaf clover?\nWell, I’ll soon have you seeing double!\c\nI’m the middle sister, and I’m one Clover you\ncan’t pick![VAR 0114(0023)]
Heads, I win, and tails, you lose—you’ve got no\nchance in this game of fortunes.\c\nI’m the youngest, Coin, but I’m definitely not\nyour good-luck piece.[VAR 0114(0024)]
We’re the Miss Fortune sisters, known across the\nfrigid land of Hisui—and your luck’s just run out!
Now get ready to hand over that Growlithe![VAR 0114(0022)]
You want to take...my partner?\c\nIf your aim is to pester us with bad jokes,\nthose ridiculous introductions of yours were\r\nmore than enough![VAR 0114(0014)]
Y-yes! Exactly what she said![VAR 0114(0013)]
Now, Gengar![VAR 0114(0022)]
Thanks for the Growlithe, fools![VAR 0114(0023)]
We three can’t live the kind of lives we want\nbecause of narrow-minded groups like the\r\nDiamond Clan and the Pearl Clan.\c\nIf we want to live freely in the great land of Hisui,\nwe need to have powerful Pokémon on our side.[VAR 0114(0022)]
Don’t worry—we’ll make sure this pup grows up\nnice ’n’ strong. We’ll even make him a lord for ya![VAR 0114(0023)]
Brawow?!
Let’s take the mutt to our camp and get to work.\nNo one will bother us in a place so miserably hot.[VAR 0114(0024)]
What?! No! Growlithe![VAR 0114(0014)]
[~ 234]
What should we do, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nThis is an emergency! R-right?[VAR 0114(0013)]
B-but, uh, you see... I’ve never...I’ve never\nactually had my partner battle before...[VAR 0114(0013)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Please, [VAR 0100(0000)]... I beg you:\nhelp us.\c\nThat Growlithe is a very, very dear Pokémon to\nme. Please save him...[VAR 0114(0014)]
They said they were going to a place where\nnobody would bother them...\c\nThe only place around the Cobalt Coastlands\nthat seems suitable...is Firespit Island.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Oh! Now that you have Basculegion to help you\ncross the water, you can reach that island, too!\r\nPlease. Could you find it in you to help Palina?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Of course
Well...
Oh, thank you, thank you! You’re so kind![VAR 0114(0014)]
We will make our way to Firespit Island as well.[VAR 0114(0014)]
No, Palina... You should wait here and keep little\nGrowlithe safe.\c\nI’m sure he needs you right now.[VAR 0114(0013)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Though...I’m not sure if I want to go to an island\nwith l-lightning and bandits and...\c\nNo! Come, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nNo\r\ntime\r\nto\r\nthink!\r\nWe\r\nmust\r\ngo now![VAR 0114(0013)]
Honestly...I have to admit I’m still a little scared.\nDo you think you could head over first?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Iscan is so brave and strong. You can always\nrely on him...[VAR 0114(0014)]
Rowrrr...
[~ 249]
Whew... Firespit Island... It’s certainly hot enough\nto feel like a sweat bath, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(0013)]
And now we’ve got a ghost and bandits to deal\nwith on top of the heat...[VAR 0114(0013)]
I’m very sorry, but...do you think you could lead\nthe way, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0013)]
That poor Growlithe... I don’t dare imagine what\nthose bandits are doing to him now...[VAR 0114(0013)]
[~ 254]
Come on—evolve already![VAR 0114(0022)]
We’ve done our homework! Any Pokémon gutsy\nenough to come to this lava trap is s’posed to\r\nevolve—so get on with it already![VAR 0114(0023)]
You WILL become stronger. Like it or not.[VAR 0114(0024)]
Growow?!
Oh, look. The pest again.[VAR 0114(0022)]
Stand back, sisters—I’ll take care of h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer.\nGo, Abomasnow! Smash this fool to pieces![VAR 0114(0023)]
[~ 261]
Y’know Abomasnow can’t fight at full power in\ncrazy heat like this! It wasn’t a fair battle...\r\nWe were basically goin’ easy on you!\c\nIn fact, how dare you make poor Abomasnow\nbattle in such a stupidly hot place![VAR 0114(0023)]
You’re the one who sent out Abomasnow, Sister.\c\nGo on, then, Toxicroak. Pour out some poison\nfor our unwelcome guest.[VAR 0114(0024)]
[~ 264]
I guess I lose the coin toss sometimes...[VAR 0114(0024)]
I did warn you, didn’t I—that I had a score to\nsettle with the Galaxy Team?\c\nAll the pain and suffering I experienced after\ncoming up here from the Kanto region to work—\r\nI’m going to make you pay for every last slight![VAR 0114(0022)]
[~ 267]
H-how could all of us have been—?![VAR 0114(0022)]
Hey, Charm! I healed up Abomasnow and\nCoin’s Toxicroak, good as new!\c\nNow we can keep battling until we run out\nof Potions![VAR 0114(0023)]
Bow!
Wha—?! Hey! No one invited you, tiny![VAR 0114(0023)]
You’re really going to insist on getting in the way,\nyou little runt?[VAR 0114(0022)]
Grawow!
Take him down, Toxicroak.[VAR 0114(0024)]
I know it’s hot, but hang in there, Abomasnow!\nSmash that runt![VAR 0114(0023)]
Growlithe! Please, stop! You cannot beat\nsuch foes![VAR 0114(0014)]
P-Palina?! What are you doing here? I thought\nyou were waiting with little Growlithe...[VAR 0114(0013)]
I was! But then he jumped into the ocean without\nwarning and swam all the way here...[VAR 0114(0014)]
Into the ocean?! But he was terrified of the\nocean after it swallowed up the former lord—\r\nhis own father![VAR 0114(0013)]
Rowrrr...
Arrroooooo![VAR 0114(0004)]
Bawow!
[~ 283]
Wha—?[VAR 0114(0014)]
Palina, stay back![VAR 0114(0013)]
Arrroooooo![VAR 0114(0004)]
Grrrah!
Wh-what’s happened to him?[VAR 0114(0014)]
That strange lightning hit him...\c\nHe’s become frenzied, just like the other nobles!\nOooh, th-this is exactly why I didn’t want to\r\ncome to this island...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Ugh. Everything was going just as we’d wanted\nbefore that awful mutt ruined everything.\c\nEnough of this, sisters. We leave this place.\nWe won’t be making any living without our lives.[VAR 0114(0022)]
Hey, wait! This is all your fault![VAR 0114(0014)]
We should get out of here, too, Palina.\nOtherwise, we’re fair game for Arcanine!\r\n[VAR BD06(0000)]Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]—we\r\nshould hurry![VAR 0114(0013)]
[~ 293]
Lina![VAR 0114(000B)]
What are you going to do about Growlithe—\nI mean, Arcanine?[VAR 0114(000B)]
That dear little Pokémon is my responsibility!\nAs his warden, it is my duty to protect him\r\nwith everything I have![VAR 0114(0014)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], what must we do\nto quell\r\nhis\r\nfrenzy?\r\nPlease,\r\ntell us\r\nwhat\r\nwe need![VAR 0114(0014)]
We’ll need to make some balms![VAR 0114(000B)]
Balms...? Irida, what are you talking about?[VAR 0114(0014)]
I’m the leader of our clan! Is it so surprising that\nI know a little more of these things than you, Lina?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I held my tongue the first time, but now I must\ninsist! Stop calling me Lina in front of everyone!\c\nAnd yes, I’m well aware you’re our leader, Irida.\nHow could I forget that you were the one chosen?\c\nYou, who can use your Celestica Flute to summon\nPokémon and have them carry you to even the\r\nfarthest reaches of vast Hisui...[VAR 0114(0014)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I’ve learned a little about these frenzies as well.\nThere’s a special method for dealing with them.\c\nWe can make balms—pouches containing a mix\nof the lord’s favorite foods—and throw them\r\nfrom a safe distance. Isn’t that right,\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Well, uh...in that case, I do always carry some of\nGrowlithe’s favorite foods with me...so I can\r\nthank him when he uses his flames to help\r\nprepare Basculegion’s favorite meal...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Why, Iscan, once again your thoughtfulness\nsaves the day! Now we can make those balms\r\nright away![VAR 0114(0014)]
Yes! Let’s get right to work.[VAR 0114(0013)]
[~ 306]
They’re ready! Here are the balms we need.\nPlease let me know when you feel prepared to\r\ntry to quell Lord Arcanine’s frenzy.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Are you ready, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Yes, I’m ready!
Let me prepare a bit...
Yes, yes... Best to be well prepared.[VAR 0114(0013)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]... Please do your\nutmost\r\nto save\r\nmy\r\ndear Arcanine.\c\nHe may have finally become a lord, but it is clear\nthis frenzy is causing him to suffer greatly...[VAR 0114(0014)]
Be on your guard—the late Lord Arcanine would\nlaunch devastating attacks after standing still\r\nand gathering light around himself!\c\nRemember that while you’re dodging, moves\nwill slip right by you. Good luck![VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 314]
You received the Flame Plate from Arcanine!
Oh, look! The strange light has left Arcanine\nand...is vanishing into the space-time rift...?[VAR 0114(0014)]
What could possibly lie on the other side of\nthe rift, I wonder...[VAR 0114(0014)]
Grrrm?
Arrroooooo![VAR 0114(0004)]
What?! Was that two different Arcanine cries\njust now...?[VAR 0114(0014)]
Oh... Now I understand...[VAR 0114(0014)]
My little Growlithe... Ah, no, I misspoke.\nLord of the Isles, Arcanine!\c\nYou and I must now live apart so that we may\nattend to our separate duties.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Rowww...
Now now, all will be well. You’re strong.\nFar stronger than me, in fact.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Rowr.
From now on, let us each strive to fulfill our\nduties as lord and warden![VAR 0114(0014)]
Now go, Lord Arcanine. Your realm awaits.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Grrraaawwwrrr!
Um... Was I the only one who felt like they heard\nthe cry of the previous Lord Arcanine earlier?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Oh? How odd. I certainly didn’t.[VAR 0114(0014)]
P-please, I do hope you’re joking...\c\nI’m easily scared as it is. What am I to do if I start\nhearing the cries of ghosts all the time?[VAR 0114(0013)]
No need to worry, Iscan. I only kid.\c\nI also heard the voice of the previous lord calling\nout to us.\c\nIt seems I wasn’t the only one watching over his\nyoung pup this whole time...[VAR 0114(0014)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], you have my\nheartfelt\r\nthanks\r\nfor helping\r\nmy dear\r\nlittle one,\r\nthe new\r\nLord Arcanine.[VAR 0114(0014)]
I’m sorry to ask even more of you, but...please\nlook after Irida as well.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Now then, Iscan, I believe we’d best be off.[VAR 0114(0014)]
[~ 336]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(000B)]
I wasn’t much use just watching from the side,\nwas I...[VAR 0114(000B)]
You know, when Lina wouldn’t raise Growlithe to\nbe the new lord and people in our clan were\r\ndoubting her fitness as a warden...[VAR 0114(000B)]
I urged her to put Growlithe through the proper\ntraining, but she snapped at me.[VAR 0114(000B)]
“This poor Pokémon saw his own father die,”\nshe told me.\c\n“Is it a warden’s duty to force a child in such pain\nthrough that training?”[VAR 0114(000B)]
Those words left me with...much to consider.[VAR 0114(000B)]
And even when Arcanine became Lord of the Isles\nand grew frenzied, all I could do was watch.[VAR 0114(000B)]
What about the balms?
That’s not true
Please. All I did was arrive late and help explain\nabout the balms—something you could have\r\ndone without me.\c\nIs that so praiseworthy? Do I deserve to be\nrecognized for such a slight contribution?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I took on leadership of the Pearl Clan so young,\nwith no grand vision for what it should be...\c\nStill, I tried to respect our old customs and sites,\neven as some called me old-fashioned for it.\c\nBut watching you, I finally see. I know what I want\nto do. I want to protect this vast land of Hisui.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Grant me another battle someday,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nI want to battle alongside my partner so we can\ngrow strong enough to be of help to you...and to\r\nbroaden the horizons of the world I see![VAR 0114(000B)]
Looks like I’ve got Lina to thank for yet another\nlesson that I’ve learned. I should let her know.\c\nAnd hear more about her relationship with\nWarden Iscan, while I’m at it!\c\n[VAR BD06(0000)]Here’s where we part for now,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nI need\r\nto\r\nget\r\noff\r\nthis\r\noven\r\nof\r\nan island![VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 350]
You did well on your mission in the\nCobalt Coastlands.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Your efforts there aided not only the Galaxy\nTeam but the Pearl Clan as well.[VAR 0114(0009)]
...I do hope your efforts will also have an impact\non the space-time rift, somehow.\c\nIf we are able to get rid of that rift, it should\nclear any lingering doubts about your origins.\c\nThough how we might actually close the rift,\nI haven’t the slightest idea.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Remain true to the mission.[VAR 0114(0009)]
[~ 355]
If you notice that today’s potato mochi taste a\nbit different, well, that’s because I used a\r\nPokémon’s flames to roast ’em! Bon appétit![VAR 0114(000E)]
The birth of a new lord Pokémon... What a sight\nthat must have been! If only I had journeyed to\r\nFirespit Island to witness the event myself.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Could you even ride on Basculegion in the first\nplace, Professor?[VAR 0114(0006)]
I have a hard time imagining you making that trip\non Basculegion’s back, Professor...[VAR 0114(0007)]
Come now, you know my coordination is so poor\nI couldn’t even hit my own foot with a Poké Ball!\c\nAnd I can’t dodge Pokémon attacks to quite\nliterally save my own skin!\c\nOf course I can’t possibly ride atop a fearsome\nbeast like Basculegion!\c\nThat being said...[VAR 0114(0005)]
we’d all do well to remember these wise words:\n“The ever-striving soul is rewarded in the end.”\c\nAnd strive I shall! For the sake of my research,\nI will surely ride a Pokémon one day and record\r\nthe experience in our Pokédex for all posterity!\r\nJust you watch![VAR 0114(0005)]

The next day...
Good morning, good [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]sirlady who came from\nthe sky![VAR 0114(0004)]
Commander Kamado told me to let you know he\nawaits your arrival in his office.[VAR 0114(0004)]
[~ 3]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! I have your next orders.\c\nYou must go to the Coronet Highlands to quell\nanother frenzied noble—Electrode, Lord of\r\nthe Hollow.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Electrode has a propensity to store up electricity\nin its body, then unleash it.[VAR 0114(000A)]
But since Electrode became frenzied, those\nelectrical outbursts have become giant blasts.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Hrrrm! We’ll be enlisting the Pearl Clan’s aid\nin securing you safe passage to Electrode’s seat.\r\nI’ve sent word ahead to Irida asking—[VAR 0114(0009)]
N-no! You don’t have permission to go up th—![VAR 0114(009D)]
Oh, save it! As if I’ll be stopped by the likes of\nyou! Now, out of my way![VAR 0114(0004)]
Hey ho, Bossman Kamado! I thought it might’ve\nslipped your mind to send me an invite, so I took\r\nthe liberty of stopping by anyway.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Melli! Where are your manners? We’re having an\nimportant conversation![VAR 0114(000A)]
Well, there’s your issue right there, Adaman!\nHow exactly did you intend to discuss Electrode\r\nwithout me—its mighty warden—here to weigh in?[VAR 0114(0016)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]There’s no more to discuss. We’ve already asked\n[VAR 0100(0000)] to quell the Lord of\r\nthe Hollow.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Awww, come on! Is it ME you’re trying to\nhumiliate here or our entire clan?\c\nBesides, do you really think this flimsy little\nnoodle can quell Electrode?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Commander, I’m sincerely sorry for this\nheedless interruption![VAR 0114(000A)]
Pay it no mind. It seems even Security Corps\npersonnel I trained myself cannot stop one so\r\ncapable as Warden Melli.[VAR 0114(0009)]
That being said...[VAR 0114(0009)]
Yes?[VAR 0114(000A)]
It is clear that the Security Corps needs even\nfurther rounds of training from me later.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Hear that, Melli? The Security Corps will sob\nthemselves to sleep tonight, thanks to you.\c\nThe commander’s sumo moves can send even\nboulders flying![VAR 0114(000A)]
Hmph![VAR 0114(0016)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Now, now. That will do.\c\n[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], you have\nyour\r\norders.\r\nSee to\r\nit that\r\nElectrode\r\nis quelled!\c\nWarden Melli, of course we would appreciate\nyour help if there’s anything you might assist with.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Now, go![VAR 0114(0009)]
There are certainly some interesting characters\nin Hisui. Including you, I might add.\c\nNow then, you had best focus on your\nsurvey work![VAR 0114(0009)]
[~ 25]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Listen, Melli. The Galaxy Team—well, at least,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]—is amazing, and\r\nwe’ll\r\nprove it.\r\nFollow\r\nme outside![VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]All right, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Go a round\nwith me![VAR 0114(000A)]
You bet
Let’s not...
Come on—just be a good sport and battle me!\c\nLook. If you don’t...Melli will be completely\ninsufferable about it.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Melli, make sure you watch closely, now![VAR 0114(000A)]
You look like even a slight breeze could topple\nyou. Can you really defeat Adaman?[VAR 0114(0016)]
[~ 33]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You see how good [VAR 0100(0000)] is\nnow,\r\nyes?\r\nNo\r\nmore\r\nsneering\r\nat h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer![VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Well, uh...looks like luck was on my side this time.\c\nBut [VAR 0100(0000)] is still the one\nwho’s\r\nbeen\r\nquelling\r\nthe nobles!\c\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe deserves your respect! Got it?[VAR 0114(000A)]
... ... ...\nHmph![VAR 0114(0016)]
Now, I think our helper from the Pearl Clan was\ngoing to meet you at the training grounds once\r\nyou’re ready...?[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Till later, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Glad to\nhave\r\nyour\r\nhelp,\r\nas always![VAR 0114(000A)]
Melli! Shift yourself, unless you want to get even\nmore of an earful than you’re already due for![VAR 0114(000A)]
Aw, c’mon, Adaman! Cut me some slack here...[VAR 0114(0016)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0008)]
Join me in the Survey Corps office. We’ll go over\nthe particulars of your new mission.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 43]
Your survey work will take you to the Coronet\nHighlands next.[VAR 0114(0008)]
You’ll be on the rift’s doorstep. There’s no telling\nwhat perils await.[VAR 0114(0008)]
To take on the highlands, you must achieve the\nrank of Fourth Star or higher. You know how.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Evolve Pokémon into other Pokémon. Use items\nto stun them or induce other effects in the wild.\c\nComplete such research tasks to raise your rank.\nAnd aid with any requests that might be found on\r\nthe professor’s blackboard.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 48]
Yes? Have you made progress on your\nresearch tasks?[VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 50]
Your current rank qualifies you to conduct\nresearch in the Coronet Highlands.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 52]
But you will need help from a particular person\nto survey and ultimately quell this Electrode.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Go to the training grounds. You should find\nthem there.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 55]
I look forward to conducting you on\nthis endeavor![VAR 0114(0015)]
Hello, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000B)]
This gentleman is Warden Ingo, who serves\nSneasler. He will guide you to her domain.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Pleased to properly meet you. I apologize for\nthat abrupt how-do-you-do before.\c\nI am the warden Ingo.[VAR 0114(0015)]
I understand you’ll need a hand from Sneasler\nin order to meet Electrode.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Whether she’ll see fit to help you, however,\nwe can only find out by making the journey.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Now, let’s have a safe journey to Mount Coronet!\nAll aboard![VAR 0114(0015)]
Ingo’s a bit like you, you know.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Like me?
How so?
He appeared one day from who-knows-where.\nWhat’s more, much of his memory seems to\r\nbe missing.\c\nMaybe traveling with you will help fill in some of\nthe gaps in his memory.[VAR 0114(000B)]
In any case, I’m glad to have your help to count\non once again, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nGood luck up in the highlands![VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 68]
There you are, my [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl! Welcome to the\nCoronet Highlands!\c\nI expect you’ll find all sorts of Rock-type and\nGround-type Pokémon wandering about these\r\ncraggy, boulder-strewn heights![VAR 0114(0005)]
And up there...\c\nRight beneath that great rift in space-time is the\npeak of Mount Coronet itself!\c\nThe magnetism from it may well exert some\nsort of influence on the Pokémon throughout\r\nthe area. Fascinating stuff![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 71]
The Electrode known as the Lord of the Hollow\nis somewhat different from the Electrode I recall.[VAR 0114(0015)]
But its electrical discharges, at least, are familiar.\nOne false step around it could put you in danger.[VAR 0114(0015)]
If you’re going to face it, you might consider\ncatching Pokémon that can withstand electricity.[VAR 0114(0015)]
It must be difficult being a Pokémon, don’t you\nthink? Especially one as irritable as Electrode.\r\nThen becoming frenzied, to boot...[VAR 0114(0015)]
So true! It’s a tough old life for Pokémon and\nhumans alike![VAR 0114(0004)]
Well, well. Warden Ingo of the Pearl Clan...\nAnd...oh my! The Galaxy Team grunt from before.[VAR 0114(0016)]
You’re punching well above your weight to seek\nout the great Electrode, Lord of the Hollow![VAR 0114(0016)]
But! By the sheer tenderness of my heart, I’ll\ngrant you a trial to see if you’re worthy.\c\nThe greatest obstacle you’ll ever face awaits\nyou right here! Battle me—if you dare![VAR 0114(0016)]
Absolutely not
Maybe another time
Hmph! Well then, let me tell you the great Melli’s\ntake on this whole situation.\c\nThe frenzy of our nobles is nothing other than a\nmark of almighty Sinnoh’s favor and protection!\c\nWhy? Because it makes them stronger! Do I really\nneed to spell out that that’s a good thing?[VAR 0114(0016)]
We must let my lord frenzy as it may, to\ndemonstrate to almighty Sinnoh that the\r\nDiamond Clan lives as is right and good![VAR 0114(0016)]
This may even be—dare I say it—the very reason\nI am here on this earth![VAR 0114(0016)]
What business is it of the Galaxy Team’s, anyway,\nif Electrode lets loose a few sparks out here in\r\nthe mountains?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Really, you should do us all a favor and slink\nback home to that village of yours, rather than\r\npersist in this folly. And with that...bon voyage![VAR 0114(0016)]
What a selfish outlook. These frenzies cause the\nPokémon themselves such suffering![VAR 0114(0015)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]But what is it you want to do,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Press on
Turn back
Very well! The tracks ahead will be perilous, but I\npride myself on safe driving![VAR 0114(0015)]
Very understandable. But alas, I doubt flouting\nyour commander’s orders will end well.[VAR 0114(0015)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]To meet Sneasler, [VAR 0100(0000)],\nyou\r\nmust\r\npass\r\nthrough\r\nhere: Wayward Cave.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Here you’ll find Pokémon like Golbat and their ilk,\nwhich are quite at home navigating in the dark.[VAR 0114(0015)]
It’s quite dim inside, so you’ll need to watch\nyour step![VAR 0114(0015)]
[~ 96]
[~ 97]
Well, this is odd. The torches that light the way\nthrough the cave are gone.\c\nCould this be Melli attempting to obstruct us?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Either way, there’s no need for concern. I know\nmy route, and I’ll conduct us safely.[VAR 0114(0015)]
No darkness nor foul weather will delay us!\nOnward we roll![VAR 0114(0015)]
Take care not to come uncoupled from me![VAR 0114(0015)]
I recall, faintly, that I had a partner once.\nA precious one.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Its name escapes me, but I remember that it\nwielded flames with mastery.[VAR 0114(0015)]
If only it were here, I’m sure it would light the\nway, luring us onward...[VAR 0114(0015)]
Please don’t fall behind!\nWe must keep on schedule![VAR 0114(0015)]
I can hardly conduct you if you pull so far ahead![VAR 0114(0015)]
Hurry! We mustn’t separate.[VAR 0114(0015)]
No more reckless charging off, please.[VAR 0114(0015)]
[~ 109]
Please forgive the unscheduled stop.[VAR 0114(0015)]
I detect an alpha Crobat to our right.\c\nUnder normal circumstances, I doubt its presence\nwould obstruct someone so competent as you...[VAR 0114(0015)]
But given the poor visibility, I propose a track\nchange in the interest of safety. Please follow me.[VAR 0114(0015)]
I’m starting to recall a man who looked...like me.\nWe’d battle and discuss Pokémon, I think...[VAR 0114(0015)]
The words “I like winning more than anything\nelse” flashed through my mind just now...[VAR 0114(0015)]
[~ 115]
We’ll soon be arriving at Wayward Cave’s exit.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Even if the memories themselves have faded...\nit appears much still lives on in my heart.[VAR 0114(0015)]
[~ 118]
This is fine progress. We’re nearly home free.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Wait—could those be...?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Let me put those torches back where they\nbelong. This darkness could be perilous for the\r\nnext person to pass through here.[VAR 0114(0015)]
I beg your pardon for the delay. I have lit and\nreturned the torches.[VAR 0114(0015)]
My safety concerns have been addressed.\nReady for departure![VAR 0114(0015)]
If you follow the track marked by torches, you’ll\nreach the terminus of this cave![VAR 0114(0015)]
[~ 125]
Professor Laventon told me how you fell to this\nland from the sky.[VAR 0114(0015)]
For my part, I simply found myself one day here\nin Hisui, a region whose name I’d never heard...[VAR 0114(0015)]
All I could remember was my own name.\c\nI was still standing there in bafflement when the\nPearl Clan came to my aid.[VAR 0114(0015)]
I showed a natural affinity for taming Pokémon,\nwhich is why I eventually became a warden.\r\nBut still I wonder what my true purpose is here...[VAR 0114(0015)]
Ah, but now I’ve sidetracked us with this talk.\nLet’s hurry onward![VAR 0114(0015)]
[~ 131]
What’s the big idea, putting back all the torches\nI spent ages tidying away?\c\nDo you get some sort of amusement stomping\naround and ruining people’s noble deeds?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Oh? Rendering a cave impassable to people\nwho venture inside hardly seems noble to me.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Hmph. Well, this just goes to show that even we\nwardens don’t always see eye to eye.\c\nI extinguished those lights for the sake of the\nPokémon in that cave who prefer the dark.[VAR 0114(0016)]
But now you louts have put my efforts to waste.\nIf you think I’ll just let you saunter ahead to\r\nmeet Lord Electrode, you’re sorely mistaken![VAR 0114(0016)]
The only way you’re getting past me...is if you\ndefeat my partner Pokémon![VAR 0114(0016)]
How will you proceed, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0015)]
I’ll beat him
I don’t want to fight...
Are you certain? It seems this is our only\ntrack forward...[VAR 0114(0015)]
Go, Skuntank! Show these louts the true meaning\nof silent but deadly![VAR 0114(0016)]
Listen here! Neither I nor Skuntank admit defeat\njust yet—our challenge to you still stands![VAR 0114(0016)]
However! I will withdraw to afford Skuntank\ntime to recover.[VAR 0114(0016)]
There’s no shame in a tactical retreat. It’s more of\nan advance, if you think about it!\c\nKeep your guard up—we’ll be back.[VAR 0114(0016)]
What a lively character.[VAR 0114(0015)]
I cannot fathom Warden Melli’s intentions... But\nfor now, let us press on![VAR 0114(0015)]
[~ 147]
This is the Ancient Quarry.[VAR 0114(0015)]
The stones used to build the temple atop this\nmountain were all cut from this place...[VAR 0114(0015)]
Whether by humans and Pokémon working as one,\nor by the labor of Pokémon alone, I cannot say.[VAR 0114(0015)]
The stones that were left behind should serve\nto cover us from the gazes of wild Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Once we’re through here, it will be just a little\nfurther. Let us move with speed...but not haste![VAR 0114(0015)]
[~ 153]
Ah! There you are, Ingo![VAR 0114(000C)]
Volo, was it? What is the matter, sir?[VAR 0114(0015)]
I wanted to ask about that memory loss of yours.\c\nHave you considered that it could have somehow\nbeen caused by the space-time rift?[VAR 0114(000C)]
I have no cause to think the rift is to blame...but\nthen again, I hardly remember a thing, so it’s\r\ndifficult to say with certainty.\c\nI can’t remember my own home, nor my family,\nif I had any...[VAR 0114(0015)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]So you might do better to pose your questions\nto [VAR 0100(0000)], I think, if it’s to do\r\nwith\r\nthat rift.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Indeed... Well, I do hope your memories return,\nWarden Ingo.[VAR 0114(000C)]
How about you, then, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nDo you remember what you saw before you fell\nout of that rift? Was there anything inside?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Maybe something...
I saw nothing
Interesting... You see, personally, I suspect that\nwhatever is on the other side of that rift is\r\ncausing the strange lightning that plagues us.[VAR 0114(000C)]
That makes sense
You think so?
Indeed! I did some digging and found records\nindicating that this same space-time rift also\r\nappeared in Hisui in the distant past.\c\nThat’s why we already had a name for it as\nit appeared, in fact.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Now, what kind of world do you suppose\nstretches out on the other side of the rift?[VAR 0114(000C)]
My guess is that it is almighty Sinnoh’s realm...[VAR 0114(000C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]But then that begs the question: Why has the\nspace-time rift reopened, when it closed once\r\nso long ago?\c\nAnd why would [VAR 0100(0000)]\nhave\r\nfallen\r\nthrough to us?\r\nThere’s just so much we don’t know...[VAR 0114(000C)]
I fervently hope you unravel this mystery, Volo.\c\nI’m sure it would ease people’s fears over the\nfrenzies of our nobles.[VAR 0114(0015)]
And while you investigate, sir, I’ll continue to\nprioritize the safety of the people living in\r\nthis world.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Oh, I am a mere admirer of ruins and little more!\nIf something needs investigating, then I would\r\nentrust that task to [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nUntil next time, then![VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 173]
We have arrived at our destination.[VAR 0114(0015)]
You would never expect to be able to climb such\nsheer cliffs as these, yes?[VAR 0114(0015)]
But with Sneasler as an ally, it becomes the work\nof a moment.\c\nShe is so at home on a cliff face, one might think\nshe knew some secret—some hidden move...[VAR 0114(0015)]
What am I saying? Hidden moves? There are no\nsuch things in Hisui, surely...[VAR 0114(0015)]
Yet I feel as though I was on the cusp of\nremembering something just now...[VAR 0114(0015)]
Just who was I before I came to Hisui?[VAR 0114(0015)]
If you fell from the sky...you come from another\nworld altogether, most likely.\c\nPerhaps a Pokémon battle with you would jog this\nmemory loose...[VAR 0114(0015)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Would you honor me with a battle,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0015)]
All right
Maybe not...
I see. The choice, of course, is yours.[VAR 0114(0015)]
All aboard, then! Machoke, prepare for departure![VAR 0114(0015)]
[~ 186]
Your talent has brought you to the destination\ncalled Victory![VAR 0114(0015)]
Now, allow me to call Sneasler...[VAR 0114(0015)]
Snawwwr!
[VAR BD06(0000)]Allow me to introduce you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nThis keen-clawed Pokémon is Sneasler.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Would you be so kind as to play your flute for\nher to hear?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Sneasler opened her heart and learned well the\nsound of your playing!
You can now call Sneasler to scale and descend\nsheer cliffs and rock faces!
You received the Toxic Plate from Sneasler!
I’m afraid this is my final stop.\c\nPlease proceed up the cliffs with Sneasler’s aid\nand quell the lord up in the mountains![VAR 0114(0015)]
I will return to Jubilife Village. Please convey my\nwell wishes to Warden Melli.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Now, then—all aboard![VAR 0114(0015)]
[~ 198]
Welcome to Moonview Arena—the seat of\nLord Electrode![VAR 0114(0016)]
I know I’ve not exactly been supportive of you\nreaching this place, but a part of me did hope\r\nyou’d make it.\c\nCall me contradictory all you like, Galaxy grunt,\nbut such is life. Embracing the complexity of both\r\nourselves and the world can only help us grow.[VAR 0114(0016)]
As a member of the Diamond Clan, my highest\ncalling is to please almighty Sinnoh.\c\nAnd right now, that means I must protect my lord\nby stopping you where you stand![VAR 0114(0016)]
If you still wish to defeat me and gain entry to\nElectrode’s seat, you and your little Pokémon are\r\nwelcome to give it your best shot![VAR 0114(0016)]
Let’s go, Skuntank! Give them another whiff of\nyour silent deadliness![VAR 0114(0016)]
[~ 204]
Let’s make one thing clear: I didn’t lose!\nYou may have won...but there’s a difference![VAR 0114(0016)]
I just lacked...errr...time! Yes, I’m afraid there\nsimply wasn’t enough time for me to raise my\r\nPokémon nice and strong![VAR 0114(0016)]
Ah! Could this be why Adaman is always going\non and on about time being a precious thing?!\c\nMy word, the Diamond Clan and almighty Sinnoh\ntruly are never-ending founts of wisdom![VAR 0114(0016)]
Yes, yes, I know what comes next. You want to\nknow what pleases Lord Electrode so you can\r\nmake some balms for it.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Well, I’m afraid I won’t be able to help you...[VAR 0114(0016)]
Because I have completely forgotten what\nElectrode likes![VAR 0114(0016)]
What’s the matter? Upset? Too bad anger\ndoesn’t make balms![VAR 0114(0016)]
Melli’s really giving you the runaround, isn’t\nhe, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000A)]
I guess it’s my fault for not telling you in advance\nwhat Electrode likes. So here’s the—[VAR 0114(000A)]
Adamaaan![VAR 0114(0016)]
What now?[VAR 0114(000A)]
I could hear you just now, you know! Are you\nreally going to tell this little noodle what [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she\r\nneeds to find? Just like that?![VAR 0114(0016)]
Lest we all forget, you’re the leader of the\nDiamond Clan!\c\nWhy do you bother with these Galaxy louts?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Use your eyes, Melli. Haven’t you even looked at\nyour frenzied lord?\c\nDon’t you feel even a twinge at how it suffers,\nfighting to control the energy that’s bursting\r\nout of it?[VAR 0114(000A)]
I see nothing but a Pokémon overcome with joy\nat being among almighty Sinnoh’s chosen ones![VAR 0114(0016)]
Anyway, it’s not like trials and suffering are\nalways cause for doom and gloom.\c\nThese things exist to help us grow![VAR 0114(0016)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I’m sorry, Melli. I can’t write off these frenzies\nas some trial from almighty Sinnoh.\c\nThat’s why I’m doing the best I can to help out\n[VAR 0100(0000)] here.\r\nThis\r\nis\r\nbigger\r\nthan\r\nwhat\r\nteam\r\nor\r\nclan\r\nwe\r\nbelong to![VAR 0114(000A)]
Oh, and by the way? I wasn’t just going to tell\nh[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer that [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she needs Crunchy Salt—I was going to\r\ngo right ahead and give it to h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Now it’s time to make some balms. So lend a\nhand—both of you![VAR 0114(000A)]
Fine! At the end of the day, let none say that\nthe great Melli shirked his duties as warden.\r\nI’ll help make your precious balms![VAR 0114(0016)]
[~ 225]
There! I made you a practically infinite supply of\nbalms, so chuck all you like at Electrode.\c\nBut don’t underestimate my lord’s strength!\nI very much doubt the likes of you can quell it.[VAR 0114(0016)]
So, even knowing you’re doomed to fail, you still\nwish to pit yourself against Electrode?[VAR 0114(0016)]
I’m ready to battle
I’ll pass, thanks
Heh. You’ve a great deal more pluck than you\nhave sense, I’ll give you that.\c\nA word of advice: don’t stop moving while you’re\nbattling Electrode, or you’ll be dead in no time![VAR 0114(0016)]
What did I make all these balms for, then? Did\nyou just want to gawk at my skillful handiwork?[VAR 0114(0016)]
These balm things do smell pretty delightful...[VAR 0114(000A)]
[~ 233]
You received the Zap Plate from Electrode!
Oh, for shame! What utter calamity...[VAR 0114(0016)]
I agreed to make those accursed balms, yes...\nBut now that almighty Sinnoh’s precious blessing\r\nhas vanished forever...it’s just so unbearably sad![VAR 0114(0016)]
Is that how you see it? Electrode looks relieved\nto me. Glad its suffering’s ended, probably.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Oh, come on, Adaman! Seriously? That’s just\nyour wishful thinking, nothing more.[VAR 0114(0016)]
All your preaching doesn’t ruffle me one bit, but\nif almighty Sinnoh grows angry with me because\r\nof this...I don’t know what I’ll do![VAR 0114(0016)]
I arrive, right on schedule![VAR 0114(0015)]
Now what did YOU bother coming back for?![VAR 0114(0016)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Only to say that I recalled some things after\n[VAR 0100(0000)] did me the honor of\r\ntraveling\r\nwith me.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Things to do with a world where I believe I lived\nbefore my memories were lost.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Most people there caught Pokémon, lived with\nthem, formed supportive partnerships with them...[VAR 0114(0015)]
And then there were the Pokémon Trainers...\c\nThe ones we called Pokémon Trainers were truly\ndevoted to their craft.\c\nThey always looked toward the next challenge\nand had Pokémon battles every chance they got,\r\nall to help themselves and their Pokémon grow.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Through battle, Trainers forged bonds of\nunderstanding with their Pokémon, and with\r\ntheir opponents and their Pokémon, too.\r\nWith everything, I suppose.[VAR 0114(0015)]
If Pokémon and people work together, we can\nforge new paths forward.\c\nWe’ll be lost to history if we go on believing\nonly Pokémon can be strong—or if we go on\r\nfearing them instead of understanding them.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Interesting... Was your world like Ingo described\ntoo, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000A)]
It sure was
I don’t remember
I’d never have thought such a world could exist.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Pokémon and people working together in close\nharmony, huh...\c\nCould our nobles’ frenzies be some kind of test,\nafter all?\c\nTo see if we can achieve that kind of harmony as\nwe flail around trying to fix things?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Oh! Once again, the brilliant Warden Melli has\nrealized something rather clever!\c\nIt’s not just my Pokémon that need to be strong—\nit’s me as well! The greater my valor and might,\r\nthe more my Pokémon can reach their potential![VAR 0114(0016)]
I wonder if almighty Sinnoh will be pleased once\nI’ve achieved exactly that?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Hey, Adaman! Share with me again the wisdom of\nalmighty Sinnoh passed down among our clan![VAR 0114(0016)]
All right, all right! Open your ears, shut that big\nmouth, and listen well, my friend!\c\n“Give not into sorrow. Give not into anger.\nOffer only friendship to those around you.\c\n“Give not into sorrow. Give not into anger.\nBring not almighty Sinnoh to sorrow.\r\nFor that is when time’s flow will cease.”\c\nAnd there you have it.[VAR 0114(000A)]
[~ 257]
Bravo! Excellent![VAR 0114(0015)]
Please, all of you, do your best and run toward\nthe destination—an even higher state![VAR 0114(0015)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Of course, your “higher state” is clear,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nIt surely\r\nlies\r\nwith\r\nthe\r\nnext lord![VAR 0114(0015)]
Now, this time I really will make the complete\nreturn trip to Jubilife Village.[VAR 0114(0015)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Perhaps with someone like\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nto show\r\nthat\r\nPokémon\r\nneed\r\nnot be\r\nfeared,\r\nthe\r\npeople of\r\nHisui will\r\nfind new\r\ntracks forward.[VAR 0114(0015)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Now, begging your pardon, I owe Commander\nKamado my report. Until next\r\ntime,\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0015)]
Can we find a way to honor our past while also\nforging a better future?\c\nMaybe that’s what almighty Sinnoh really wants\nfrom us. After all, it rules over all time...\r\nand it created everything there is.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Be ready to shield your eyes, Galaxy grunt!\c\nI’m going to polish up both myself and Electrode\nuntil our strength and brilliance are blinding![VAR 0114(0016)]
[~ 266]
Hrrrm...\c\nSo Warden Melli believes that the frenzies of\nthese Pokémon are some sort of trial set by\r\nalmighty Sinnoh...[VAR 0114(0009)]
We cannot know if that is the case or not, but\nit does beg the question: Whyever would this\r\n“almighty Sinnoh” drive the nobles to frenzy?[VAR 0114(0009)]
Is it angered by something? Or does it seek to\ndrive a wedge between people and Pokémon?\c\nWell, far be it from us humans to fathom the\nthoughts of Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0009)]
And what is that space-time rift, anyway? What\ncaused it to open...?[VAR 0114(0009)]
Hrrrm. But you must be tired. Go on, then—to\nthe Wallflower. Get some rest while you can.[VAR 0114(0009)]
I’ve instructed Beni to prepare you his finest\npotato mochi.[VAR 0114(0009)]
[~ 273]
Dinner’s on Kamado tonight. Eat your fill![VAR 0114(000E)]
Wh-what an enticing aroma! My appetite just\nwent through the roof![VAR 0114(0005)]
This is generous for the boss.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Quite a change from the commander’s usual\npreaching about tightening our belts until things\r\ngrow more stable.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Well, I’ve heard talk that our progress surveying\nPokémon has made gathering ingredients a less\r\nonerous—or at least less dangerous—task.[VAR 0114(0005)]
But can we talk about how you’ve gone from\nbeing some nobody from nowhere to basically\r\nthe hero of Hisui?[VAR 0114(0006)]
It’s almost like a fairy tale, isn’t it—how you’ve\nfallen to us from the sky and gone on to help the\r\npeople of Hisui so much?[VAR 0114(0007)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Indeed! Taking on such perilous duties has earned\nyou a great deal of trust,\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nIt’s like I always say: “Behavior is a mirror that\nreflects one’s true nature.”[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You let your actions do the speaking for you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)], and the message is\r\nclear\r\nas day!\c\nIt doesn’t matter one whit where you came from.\nYou’re part of the Survey Corps and Jubilife\r\nVillage now![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 283]
The next day...
Isn’t it nice getting up early?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Is it? It’s not as if getting up early changes\nwhat you can do with the day.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Yes, it does! It opens up possibilities...such as\nresponding to Commander Kamado’s invitation\r\ntoday in a timely manner![VAR 0114(000A)]
Well, I got that same invitation, and I had to\nwake up even earlier than you to run all the way\r\nhere for it![VAR 0114(000B)]
Come on. No need to grouse so much over\na nice little early wake-up.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Are you coming, too? I’m sure we all can guess\nwhat the commander wants with us.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Yes, do come. Galaxy Hall is quite close anyway.[VAR 0114(000B)]

Fine work researching the Pokémon around the\nMount Coronet area.[VAR 0114(0009)]
You are ready for new orders, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nYou’re to begin surveying the Alabaster Icelands.[VAR 0114(0009)]
The Alabaster Icelands are buried in frost and\nsnow. The weak will find no footing there![VAR 0114(0009)]
Surveying the Pokémon of this frozen reach will\ntake everything the Survey Corps can give.\r\nDo not spare an ounce of effort![VAR 0114(0009)]
Making headway in the Alabaster Icelands?\nKeep Cyllene apprised of your progress.[VAR 0114(0009)]
[~ 5]
You handled the situation with Electrode well.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 7]
You’ve now quelled the frenzy of four nobles.[VAR 0114(0009)]
It wasn’t easy
On to the next one!
When word of these frenzies arrived from all\nover Hisui, I feared what would become of us.\r\nBut here we are, already preparing to quell the\r\nfinal noble.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Yeah, who would’ve dreamed some stranger who\ntumbled out of the sky would be our salvation?\r\nLife never does stop surprising you.[VAR 0114(000A)]
The only lord left to be quelled is Avalugg, which\nlives in the Alabaster Icelands.[VAR 0114(0009)]
He is also the largest of the nobles, according\nto what Irida told me.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Your mission is to quell Avalugg, the final lord!\c\nAnd perhaps in doing so, we may trigger some\nchange in the space-time rift as well![VAR 0114(0009)]
Avalugg may be the Pearl Clan’s noble, but my\nclan and the Galaxy Team will have to step up to\r\nresolve this, too—for the sake of a brighter future![VAR 0114(000A)]
Then let us all meet in the cold reaches of the\nAlabaster Icelands. Until then.[VAR 0114(000B)]
No matter how many of these frenzied Pokémon\nyou may quell, the fact remains that you are\r\na stranger to our world.\c\nNo small number of people still regard you with\nsuspicion and distrust.\c\nThe most you can hope for is to gain the trust\nof as many as possible, and to do that, you must\r\nprove yourself through your actions.[VAR 0114(0009)]
[~ 19]
Gyah![VAR 0114(0008)]
A-Abra! Teleport this Wurmple outside! At once![VAR 0114(0008)]
Ahem.\c\nSo. You’re to survey the Alabaster Icelands next.[VAR 0114(0008)]
This is the most treacherous clime you’ll face\nin all Hisui.[VAR 0114(0008)]
If you intend to go, show me you’re equal to the\nchallenge by earning your Fifth Star.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Witness Pokémon using moves in various styles.\nCatch Pokémon at different times.\c\nComplete such research tasks to raise your rank.\nAnd aid with any requests that might be found on\r\nthe professor’s blackboard.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 26]
Yes? Have you made progress on your\nresearch tasks?[VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 28]
It would not be an exaggeration to say that you\nmight be the only one among the Survey Corps\r\nI can task with surveying the Alabaster Icelands.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 30]
You know your orders. See your mission through.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 32]
So, we’re to make for the Alabaster Icelands?[VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s right
Not quite yet
I see...\c\nOf course I’m all too aware of the injuries done\nto some of our own good people because of\r\nthe frenzies of the other nobles.\c\nThere seemed little choice but to intervene...[VAR 0114(0005)]
But this Avalugg out in the Alabaster Icelands\nhasn’t harmed a soul, as I hear it.\c\nDoes it really behoove us to go out of our way\nto subdue him?[VAR 0114(0005)]
If Avalugg’s as huge and strong as they say, there’s\na good chance he could start an avalanche.[VAR 0114(0006)]
If Avalugg’s as great and mighty as they say, he\ncould very well cause avalanches...[VAR 0114(0007)]
Avalanches don’t require any Pokémon’s help.\nThey occur perfectly well on their own, you know.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I confess I still have my doubts whether we\nshould even be getting involved in this case.\c\nNo damage has been done so far, but if we send\n[VAR 0100(0000)] out there, we’ll be\r\nputting\r\nh[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer\r\nin danger\r\nof\r\nreal harm![VAR 0114(0005)]
But people say the frenzies make the nobles\nsuffer, right?\c\nSo wouldn’t it be a kindness for us to quell\nthe lord?[VAR 0114(0006)]
But if the lord is suffering in its frenzy like people\nsay, then wouldn’t it be kinder to quell it?[VAR 0114(0007)]
There’s simply so much we don’t yet understand\nwhen it comes to the noble Pokémon...\c\nWe don’t know whether their frenzies truly are\ncausing them to suffer, nor do we know why they\r\nenter these states in the first place or if this is all\r\nconnected somehow to the space-time rift.[VAR 0114(0005)]
What is it, I wonder, that the commander hopes\nwill come about from our quelling the nobles?\c\nOr, indeed, from surveying any of the Pokémon\nof this land? What is it he hopes to achieve...?[VAR 0114(0005)]
A way to coexist?
Protecting everyone?
I certainly hope so.\c\nThe goal of my research is to help build a future\nwhere everyone gets along with Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Indeed, the better we understand our Pokémon\nneighbors, the safer we’ll all feel and be.\c\nBut if the real goal of this mission is to quell a\nnoble for quelling’s sake, rather than for the\r\nsake of scientific study, then...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Professor...?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Professor Laventon...?[VAR 0114(0007)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Ah! Nothing to bother yourselves about!\nDoubtless I’m just being a silly sausage.\c\nYou’ve got a mission to carry out, haven’t you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]? Then we will support\r\nyou\r\nin it.[VAR 0114(0005)]
How about I offer my support by giving you\nanother shot at honing your battle skills?[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m gonna win
I’d better not
Look, I know better than anyone how good you\nare. And I’m still the one asking for a battle!\c\nSo come on—give me a shot against you![VAR 0114(0006)]
Yeah, but I’m still glad to get to battle you.\nI owe you a lot, you know.\c\nIf you hadn’t tumbled down to us, I might never\nhave learned to battle alongside Pikachu![VAR 0114(0006)]
The best support I can offer you now is another\nchance to practice your battle skills.[VAR 0114(0007)]
I’m gonna win
I’d better not
I may not be able to beat you, but there’s always\nsomething to be learned from seeing how battle\r\nunfolds between different Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0007)]
I’m glad just to get the opportunity to battle you.\c\nThe fact that I’ve been able to grow so much\nas a Survey Corps member and work together\r\nwith Pikachu is due to you joining us.[VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 63]
Good luck on your mission in the icelands.\c\nThis sounds like it’ll be a perilous one, dealing\nwith a huge Pokémon like Avalugg...[VAR 0114(0006)]
About your mission in the icelands... Well, it will\nbe a challenge. Be careful out there.[VAR 0114(0007)]
As for me, I’ll set off for the Alabaster Icelands\nforthwith! See you there, my [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 67]
My word, it’s rather chilly here, isn’t it? Glad to\nsee you made it safe and sound, in any case.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Very few venture to these Alabaster Icelands—\napart from Tao Hua leading the odd Supply\r\nCorps excursion to gather materials.[VAR 0114(0005)]
But the Survey Corps, of course, must go\nanywhere that Pokémon are found![VAR 0114(0005)]
From what I gather, Icepeak Arena—where you’ll\nfind Avalugg—is rather far off, I’m afraid![VAR 0114(0005)]
Doubtless this mission to tackle Avalugg will\nbe another dangerous one.\c\nLearn all that you can from Irida and Adaman\nto try to keep yourself safe.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 73]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! Brisk out here, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(000B)]
How aren’t you freezing?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Freezing? I’m practically sweating.\c\nIf you think this is bad, just wait. This is nothing\ncompared to where we’re headed.[VAR 0114(000B)]
You know, I’m beginning to think the problem\nbetween us isn’t a Diamond Clan thing or a Pearl\r\nClan thing. It’s just a you-and-me thing.\c\nWe’ll never see eye to eye on anything, will we?[VAR 0114(000A)]
I don’t see how we could, as long as you and\nyour clan cling to your vision of an almighty\r\nSinnoh that reigns over time.\c\nForgive my bluntness, but if such a being even\ndoes exist, it’s certainly not almighty Sinnoh.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Yes, yes. Believe what you want. Just tell us\nwhere we have to go.[VAR 0114(000A)]
We’re headed to see my teacher. And he’s only\never found in one place.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Which is?\c\nYou’re talking about that Gaeric fellow, right?\nWhere do we find him?[VAR 0114(000A)]
At Avalugg’s Legacy, obviously! Where else but a\ngreat mass of ice could I have meant when I said\r\nwe’d be headed somewhere even colder?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Where else, indeed.\c\nReady to go, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Sure! Stomp off without me!\c\nThis is why I can’t stand people who only care\nabout whether time is passing them by![VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]See you at Avalugg’s Legacy,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\r\nTake care on your way![VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 86]
Well, that was a real slog, fighting through those\nmiserable icy winds to reach this desolate bit of\r\nnowhere. Well done, us.[VAR 0114(000A)]
This gentleman is Avalugg’s warden and my\nmost honorable teacher, Gaeric.\c\nSo show some respect, Adaman![VAR 0114(000B)]
Let’s begin with some proper introductions![VAR 0114(0004)]
I am Gaeric. I serve as one of the Pearl\nClan’s wardens.[VAR 0114(0017)]
And you must be [VAR 0100(0000)], right?\nOf the Galaxy Team.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Answer me this, would you? On what grounds do\nyou come here seeking to quell Lord Avalugg?[VAR 0114(0017)]
He’s in a frenzy
I was commanded to
That leads to my next question: What is wrong\nwith him being frenzied?[VAR 0114(0017)]
It could trouble others
I don’t know
Then I have another question: Setting aside any\norders, what is it your heart tells you to do?[VAR 0114(0017)]
To quell his frenzy
I don’t know
Our mighty Lord of the Tundra, Avalugg, has\ndone nothing to trouble any person or Pokémon![VAR 0114(0017)]
Sir! Please try to keep your cool![VAR 0114(000B)]
For now, indeed, Avalugg’s causing no trouble.\c\nBut aren’t we also duty bound to free our people\nfrom living in fear that such a colossal Pokémon\r\nmight begin to wreak havoc at any moment?[VAR 0114(000B)]
We are. There’s certainly some logic to that.\nBut if that is what you hope to accomplish, then\r\nwe must judge whether this child is up to the task![VAR 0114(0017)]
Who cares about the grandstanding? Let’s get\nto battling![VAR 0114(0017)]
Let’s start!
Let’s not
Then you will never earn my approval! If you\nwon’t allow me to test your mettle, all there is for\r\nme to do is resume my training![VAR 0114(0017)]
My musculature is as hard and unyielding as ice!\nThink you can break through?![VAR 0114(0017)]
Come on—show him what you’re made of, or\nwe’ll never get anywhere.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Gaeric’s Pokémon are as hard and unyielding as\nhis musculature![VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 112]
Outstanding! I’m tough as an iceberg, but you\nsmashed me through and through![VAR 0114(0017)]
I suppose you all can get on with it now. This\none’s all right![VAR 0114(0017)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Thank you, sir!\c\nSome may still have their doubts about a stranger\nlike [VAR 0100(0000)], but I’ll vouch\r\nfor h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer![VAR 0114(000B)]
Then if you insist on quelling Avalugg’s frenzy,\nyou’ll want to claim some of that Eternal Ice\r\nhe likes and bring it to my lord’s seat. Good luck![VAR 0114(0017)]
Eternal Ice, is it? For that, you’ll have to be able\nto fly—which means you need Braviary.\c\nLong story short: you’ve got to seek out a young\nlady named Sabi![VAR 0114(000A)]
Tell the long story long! You’re not saving any\ntime if we waste it puzzling out what you mean![VAR 0114(000B)]
Isn’t Avalugg one of the Pearl Clan’s lords?\nSeems a bit odd for me to do the talking...[VAR 0114(000A)]
But fine. Listen up: This Eternal Ice stuff can be\nfound atop Avalugg’s Legacy here.[VAR 0114(000A)]
But to get there, you’ll need my clan’s help.\c\nNot even Sneasler can climb this surface, let\nalone a person, like you or me. You’re going to\r\nhave to approach by air—with Braviary’s help.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Gaeric once managed to climb nearly to the top\nof Avalugg’s Legacy, I’ll have you know.\c\nHe says he made it to within six feet of the\ntop. Might makes right—or at least height![VAR 0114(000B)]
And, uh, about Sabi... How do I put this?\nEven when she’s not flying with Braviary, she’s got\r\nher head in the clouds.\c\nWell, you’ll understand once you meet her.\nHead toward Snowpoint Temple, and you’ll\r\nprobably come across her sooner or later.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Wha—?![VAR 0114(000A)]
Sabi![VAR 0114(000A)]
My clairvoyance told me...that I’d lead you on\na chase!\c\nThink you can reach me?[VAR 0114(0018)]
I see what you meant about Sabi... But why would\nshe be up there?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Seems you better focus on pursuing Warden Sabi.\nAnd let me focus on my workout while I still can![VAR 0114(0017)]
So, yep...that’s Sabi. Good luck![VAR 0114(000A)]
[~ 130]
Hello, my name’s Sabi![VAR 0114(0018)]
Nice to meet you, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0018)]
Same to you
Pleasure’s all mine
I’ve heard about you. You’re super talented,\nright? I bet you’re gonna be fun to play with![VAR 0114(0018)]
I know why you’re here, too!\c\nYou want Braviary’s help so you can quell\nAvalugg’s frenzy, don’t you?[VAR 0114(0018)]
Well, you’ll get it...[VAR 0114(0018)]
if you can catch me first![VAR 0114(0018)]
Let’s go, Braviary![VAR 0114(0018)]
[~ 140]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0018)]
You made it all the way up here in this cold![VAR 0114(0018)]
But the question is...did you catch me? Or did I\nlet myself get caught? Hmmm?[VAR 0114(0018)]
Oooh, and one more thing: Am I even\nreally clairvoyant?[VAR 0114(0018)]
You might be
No idea
Hmm. No one but me could really know, right?\c\nAnyway, the challenge continues. The next stop\nof our merry chase is Snowpoint Temple![VAR 0114(0018)]
But the real question here is...am I really having\nfun playing with you? Or am I bored? Hmmm?[VAR 0114(0018)]
Let’s go, Braviary![VAR 0114(0018)]
[~ 150]
Hi again, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0018)]
It’s nice having someone new out here to play\nwith. Safety in numbers or something like that![VAR 0114(0018)]
Anyway, here’s Snowpoint Temple! I’ve opened\nthe front door for you. Just a little more chasing\r\nleft for you to do![VAR 0114(0018)]
But the real question here is...am I really having\nfun playing with you? Or am I bored? Hmmm?[VAR 0114(0018)]
The only ones who may enter Snowpoint Temple\nare those of the Pearl Clan...and Sabi of the\r\nDiamond Clan, for some reason.
I heard what Warden Sabi said.\c\nIf you have Warden Sabi’s approval to enter,\nthen by all means, do so.\c\nBut be warned! Those who cannot solve the\ntemple’s puzzles won’t get very far within.
I’ve heard that the trick is to pay attention to\nwhich way the stone statues are looking.
Come to think of it, I believe the statues have\nsome sort of patterns on their chests, too...
[~ 159]
I guess I’ve been caught, so we’re nearly done...\nThat’s no fun.[VAR 0114(0018)]
Hey, remember my clairvoyance? It showed me\nsomething else.\c\nI saw you flying with Braviary. Do you think that’ll\ncome to pass?[VAR 0114(0018)]
I’ll make sure it does
I don’t know
Well, however the future turns out...flying with\nBraviary isn’t easy![VAR 0114(0018)]
If you really want to be able to fly high in the sky,\nprove to me you’re strong enough![VAR 0114(0018)]
Gonna take us on?[VAR 0114(0018)]
Yup
Hang on
Now, get ready, ’cause here come Rhyperior,\nMagmortar, and Electivire—all three of ’em! Go![VAR 0114(0018)]
That’s one loss! Next up, please![VAR 0114(0018)]
Another loss! Next-next up, please![VAR 0114(0018)]
You got cold feet now? After chasing me all the\nway here?[VAR 0114(0018)]
[~ 173]
Wow, you caught us AND you beat us. You’ve\nwon all our games so far!\c\nBut Braviary still wants to get to know you even\nbetter. Up to the roof we go![VAR 0114(0018)]
[~ 175]
Grawk! Grauwk!
[VAR BD06(0000)]All right, Braviary! Why not test out\n[VAR 0100(0000)]’s\r\nstrength\r\nfor yourself?[VAR 0114(0018)]
[~ 178]
Grrr! I can’t believe Braviary lost!\c\nBut that’s that. Thanks for playing with me.\nGuess I’ll head home now. Byeee![VAR 0114(0018)]
Hey!
Wait!
I was kidding.[VAR 0114(0018)]
Play along with me on your flute![VAR 0114(0018)]
Braviary opened his heart and learned well the\nsound of your playing!
You can now call Braviary and glide through the\nair with him!
You received the Sky Plate from Braviary!
Thanks, Sabi.[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Sure. Having [VAR 0100(0000)] to fly\naround\r\nwith\r\nshould\r\nbe\r\nfun\r\nfor Braviary.[VAR 0114(0018)]
Yeah? I’m glad. A world where people and\nPokémon live and work together, huh...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Tell me—why do you think the lightning that\ncomes from the rift would cause these frenzies?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Do you think this is all almighty Sinnoh’s anger?\nOr do you think this is a trial it’s putting to us?[VAR 0114(000A)]
If it is a trial—if we prove ourselves worthy,\nand we quell the last noble, calm Avalugg...\r\nthen the rift really ought to close. Right?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Even if the one who seems to be clearing this\ntrial is a newcomer like you, not one of us who’ve\r\nbeen living here in Hisui for ages now.[VAR 0114(000A)]
How come you’re playing all wise? I thought you\nweren’t a big thinker, Adaman.[VAR 0114(0018)]
Hush, Sabi! I can feel history on the move.[VAR 0114(000A)]
And as far as I can see, the one ushering in this\nnew era is you.\c\nSo if I stick with you, someday I might get to\nmeet almighty Sinnoh myself![VAR 0114(000A)]
The question is...does listening to Adaman\nfascinate you? Or bore you to tears? Hmmm?[VAR 0114(0018)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Anyway, [VAR 0100(0000)]... It’s time for\nyou\r\nto go\r\nsoar\r\nwith Braviary![VAR 0114(0018)]
If you jump from way up here, Braviary can take\nyou gliding just about anywhere![VAR 0114(0018)]
But don’t forget to get the Eternal Ice. That’s why\nyou needed Braviary in the first place, right?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Avalugg’s Legacy is down there![VAR 0114(0018)]
Now go get a feel for flying with Braviary. When\nyou’re done soaring the skies and want to land,\r\njust ask him to dive![VAR 0114(0018)]
[~ 203]
Your Arc Phone is beeping...
You obtained the Eternal Ice!
Wahahaha![VAR 0114(0017)]
At last, this summit is conquered![VAR 0114(0017)]
And I see you made it, too![VAR 0114(0017)]
Flew down to this place and obtained the\nEternal Ice, did you? What drives that burning\r\nzeal of yours, I wonder.[VAR 0114(0017)]
You gave Gaeric the Eternal Ice!
I do have to respect the effort you’ve put in.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I may still have my own doubts weighing on my\nmind, but I will make the necessary preparations\r\nso that you can face my lord, Avalugg.\c\nMeet me at Icepeak Arena.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Now, don’t try to repeat the wondrous feat\nyou’re about to see me perform!\c\nA tall leap like this can only be managed by\nhighly toned bodies like mine![VAR 0114(0017)]
Till next we meet![VAR 0114(0017)]
[~ 215]
Why, if it isn’t [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nWhat a pleasure, finding a familiar face—or any\nface—in this far corner of the Alabaster Icelands.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I came to bring Gaeric an order of Swordcaps,\nand he was more than willing to have a chat\r\nabout Avalugg![VAR 0114(000C)]
What do you say? Interested in a bit of gossip?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Absolutely!
Not really
And why wouldn’t you be![VAR 0114(000C)]
Oh, have some mercy! Can’t you see I’m dying to\ntell you what I’ve learned?\c\nWell, I’ll tell you anyway.[VAR 0114(000C)]
So, Avalugg, yes? The fifth of Hisui’s nobles...[VAR 0114(000C)]
That he is! And you know what? He’s an\nabsolute beast![VAR 0114(0017)]
Well, yes. According to what I was told, not only\ndoes he barrage you with chunks of ice—he also\r\nfires off massive icicles, and he can cause sharp\r\nice crystals to erupt from the ground below you!\c\nDoesn’t that seem a bit too powerful to take on?[VAR 0114(000C)]
What’s more, apparently the Avalugg of old\ncould be up to a hundred feet tall.\c\nDoesn’t that seem a bit too big to take on?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Oh, you’ll be all right! You just have to eat some\nSwordcaps, then give your training your all—\r\nnothing better for building muscle than that.\c\nOnward now—to the arena![VAR 0114(0017)]
Hmm, yes, well, I did want to see that Avalugg\nbut perhaps not at the cost of my life.\c\nSo I suppose my freezing digits and I will be off![VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 229]
So we are to quell Avalugg, as you wished...\nIn the end, the strength of your feelings won out.\c\nOr maybe your real strength comes from the way\nthat you walk among both people and Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Well! I suppose I’d better get to work making\nsome balms using that Eternal Ice.\c\nI’ve heard how they are made, and with muscles\nlike mine, it’ll be only a moment’s work![VAR 0114(0017)]
And there you have it![VAR 0114(0017)]
If you truly wish to quell Avalugg, then walk on.\nThe path lies before you!\c\nBut know that Avalugg will hurl chunks of ice at\nyou without relent!\c\nYou’ll need unrivaled dodging ability![VAR 0114(0017)]
I’m going
Maybe later...
[~ 236]
You received the Icicle Plate from Avalugg!
Gaeric, sir, you needn’t look quite so downcast...[VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]B-but seeing mighty Avalugg quelled—and by\nsuch a slight child...\c\nA child that fell from the very sky...\c\nIs this [VAR 0100(0000)] [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl\nsome\r\nkind\r\nof\r\nmonster\r\nin disguise?![VAR 0114(0017)]
[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe is no monster.\c\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe’s the one who risked h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser life without a\nsecond thought in order to quell our frenzied,\r\nsuffering nobles.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nGaeric cares for the Pearl Clan with all his heart\nand believes in almighty Sinnoh just as deeply.[VAR 0114(000B)]
So he has feared more than any of us that\ngetting involved with the Diamond Clan and your\r\nGalaxy Team could cause our people to flag\r\nin their devotion to almighty Sinnoh.[VAR 0114(000B)]
But that will change.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Irida...?[VAR 0114(0017)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I know your fears will change once you see what\nI’ve seen. [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nhas\r\nmuch\r\nto\r\nteach us.\c\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe’s shown us how we can overcome all manner\nof strife, so long as our Pokémon are with us![VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe’s made me want to help Glaceon realize\ngreater strength as well—and to see my whole\r\nworld grow broader![VAR 0114(000B)]
It seems you’ve already changed, Irida.[VAR 0114(0017)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I knew you could pull that off,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000A)]
You quelled every last frenzied noble!\c\nSo is that space-time rift going to start closing\nup now or what?[VAR 0114(000A)]
There’s little way of knowing for sure. Though the\nrift does seem perhaps a little smaller, somehow.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Let’s hope so, anyway.[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Well, with any luck, things will settle down now...\c\nAlthough even if the rift does start spitting out\nmore of that strange lightning, we should still be\r\nall right as long as we’ve got\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000A)]
Indeed we should be. It’s good to have h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer at\nour side.[VAR 0114(000B)]
You know something, Irida?\c\nWe may never agree on who’s got it right about\nalmighty Sinnoh, but you Pearl Clan folk aren’t all\r\nbad in my book.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Look who’s finally seen reason![VAR 0114(000B)]
Anyway, now that we’ve quelled the last noble...\c\nI say we pay grim old Commander Kamado a visit\nand see if he’ll finally crack a smile for us![VAR 0114(000A)]
What’re you going to do now that all the nobles\nhave been quelled, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000B)]
You quelled Avalugg...\c\nWe may not yet know for sure if it was right or\nnot to do so, but it was certainly a fine battle![VAR 0114(0017)]
Seeing you take on Avalugg was intense, even\nfrom up in the sky where I was watching![VAR 0114(0018)]
[~ 260]
Each of the Pokémon nobles became frenzied...\nand now each of them has been quelled.[VAR 0114(0009)]
We still have no explanation for why this calamity\nbefell us, but I’m glad to see it put to an end.[VAR 0114(0009)]
And to think peace would be restored to Hisui by\nthe hand of our mysterious rift-borne helper...[VAR 0114(0009)]
When tomorrow dawns, it will dawn on a world\nrestored to normalcy. At long last, we will be able\r\nto return to our normal lives.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Go nourish yourself at the Wallflower, and allow\nyourself a good, long rest.\c\nDon’t forget—the Survey Corps’ work is not over.\nIt does not end until our people can live here in\r\nHisui without fearing the Pokémon around us.[VAR 0114(0009)]
[~ 266]
Thanks for this nice, sizeable helping of potato\nmochi, Beni, old chum!\c\nOh, and if there’s anything else that you’d\nrecommend, by all means, bring it out![VAR 0114(0005)]
Now that Avalugg’s quelled, too, we can survey\nall over Hisui![VAR 0114(0006)]
Having the nobles all quelled puts a grave threat\nto rest.\c\nNow it’s time we focused on our survey work...\nthough we still can’t let our guard down around\r\nregular wild Pokémon, of course![VAR 0114(0007)]
I certainly had my reservations as to whether\nAvalugg needed quelling...\c\nBut if it means bringing calm to everyone, then\nI suppose we did the right thing.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I hate to think what kind of havoc the frenzied\nnobles could’ve wreaked if [VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nnever\r\ncame\r\nto us![VAR 0114(0006)]
Still, even with all the nobles quelled, the rift\ndoesn’t seem to be closing, huh?[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Although, wait—if the rift were to disappear,\nwould that mean [VAR 0100(0000)]’d\r\nbe\r\nstuck\r\nhere?[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Yes, someone might have been under attack by\nsome frenzied noble this very moment if\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nhadn’t\r\ncome\r\nfalling\r\nout of the\r\nsky to us.[VAR 0114(0007)]
I still wonder, though—just what is the space-time\nrift, anyway?[VAR 0114(0007)]
And what will make it finally go—?\c\nWait! If the rift were to vanish, would that leave\n[VAR 0100(0000)] stranded here?[VAR 0114(0007)]
I guess so
I’m not sure
[VAR BD06(0000)]Well, our little team is certainly very practiced at\ninvestigating things by now! We’ll look into the\r\nmatter and find a solution—I’ve no doubt.\c\nAnd even if we don’t, you’ll always have a home\nhere in Jubilife Village, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0005)]
Now then, tomorrow’s soon upon us, and it’ll be\nanother hard day at work for the Survey Corps!\c\nDon’t forget what we’ve got our sights on:\nnothing less than a completed Pokédex![VAR 0114(0005)]
With you around, that Pokédex is as good\nas complete.\c\nHey, how about I just tag along as your assistant?[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]That’s right. We’ll get it done, with\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nin the\r\nlead\r\nand me\r\nas the\r\nvaliant assistant.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Assistant...? Come now, Rei—don’t sell yourself\nshort! You’re a full-fledged member of the Survey\r\nCorps, too![VAR 0114(0005)]
Assistant...? Come now, Akari—don’t sell yourself\nshort! You’re a full-fledged member of the Survey\r\nCorps, too![VAR 0114(0005)]
Well, sure, I guess I am... In any case, time for a\nhearty meal and a heavy sleep![VAR 0114(0006)]
Well, thanks for that, Professor! Then I guess I’d\nbetter eat my fill and get plenty of energy for\r\nanother long day tomorrow.[VAR 0114(0007)]

This doesn’t look good, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 2]
Some sort of dreadful energy seems to be\npouring from the rift in space-time...\r\nNow the entire sky has gone red![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ve word from the commander.[VAR 0114(0008)]
You’re to report to his office at once.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 6]
Hrmmm...\c\nThe way the sky has changed... It is ominous.\nVery ominous indeed.[VAR 0114(0009)]
What’s this about, Commander?[VAR 0114(000A)]
You did call us here to discuss the quelling of all\nthe nobles...didn’t you?[VAR 0114(000B)]
That can wait. There is a more pressing concern\nhere that must be addressed.[VAR 0114(0009)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]The first strike of that strange lightning, the one\nthat drove Kleavor into a frenzy...\c\nIt struck the night that [VAR 0100(0000)]\nfell\r\nfrom\r\nthe sky,\r\ndid it not?\c\nIt only seems natural to think that the two events\nmight be linked in some way.[VAR 0114(0009)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Who or what are you really,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?![VAR 0114(0009)]
I don’t really know...
A Survey Corps member?
Indeed...[VAR 0114(0009)]
Indeed, you’ve done all I ordered.\c\nBut that does not answer the question of who\nyou really are.[VAR 0114(0009)]
You came from the rift—as did the lightning.\nYou’re connected to these frenzies, are you not?![VAR 0114(0009)]
Did you think to gain our trust by quelling the\nfrenzies you yourself brought about?[VAR 0114(0009)]
And having gained our trust, what then? What is\nit you’re really after here?[VAR 0114(0009)]
Hold on, Commander...[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]There’s nothing to suggest\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nhas\r\nwronged us![VAR 0114(000B)]
Exactly. And besides, do you really think [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she’s\ngot the sort of fearsome power it’d take to make\r\nall this happen?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Let me ask you in turn—can you prove beyond a\ndoubt that [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she is free from guilt?[VAR 0114(0009)]
This person—this stranger appeared out of a rift\nin space-time!\c\nWho here can guarantee [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she is who [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she says?\nWho here can guarantee [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she is to be trusted?[VAR 0114(0009)]
But that’s... No one can do that! You’re asking us\nto prove a negative!\c\nHow is anyone supposed to prove the absence of\nall doubt?![VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Come on—let’s be reasonable. What is\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nsupposed to do, then?[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe will be given the chance to investigate\nthis latest disaster...\c\nBut not as a member of the Galaxy Team. [VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe\nremains a suspect unless [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she can clear h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser name.[VAR 0114(0009)]
There are those in our village who cannot trust\na stranger like you who fell from the sky.\r\nAnd so I must ask you to leave. You are no longer\r\nwelcome in the Galaxy Team.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Consider yourself banished from this village until\nyou can explain why these calamities keep\r\nbefalling our good people...\c\nNo—until you’ve restored our world to its rightful\nstate and proven your innocence beyond doubt![VAR 0114(0009)]
Is that clear, Cyllene?[VAR 0114(0009)]
Yes, sir.[VAR 0114(0008)]
How can you act so heartless?! Don’t you believe\nin [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Do not attempt to intervene on h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser behalf!\c\nI will do what I must as the commander of the\nGalaxy Expedition Team.[VAR 0114(0009)]
But I have not forgotten your deeds, nor the...\nunusual skill you have displayed.\c\nThat is why I have chosen to let you walk\nout of here free rather than clap you in chains.[VAR 0114(0009)]
[~ 35]
You’re to be...expelled? From the village?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Seriously?![VAR 0114(0006)]
What? Why?![VAR 0114(0007)]
Orders are orders.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 40]
Let’s go.[VAR 0114(0008)]
This way.[VAR 0114(0008)]
This way.[VAR 0114(0008)]
This way![VAR 0114(0008)]
This way![VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 46]
We can take it from here, ma’am...[VAR 0114(0030)]
Understood.[VAR 0114(0008)]
However, the decision was mine to accept this\nstranger as a member of the Survey Corps.[VAR 0114(0008)]
It is only right that I should personally escort h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer\nfrom the village and to the Fieldlands Camp.[VAR 0114(0008)]
I’ll come, too.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ll also see him off.[VAR 0114(0007)]
As will I, naturally.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll allow it.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Then...I’ll mark you all down as bound for the\nFieldlands Camp. Safe travels...[VAR 0114(0030)]
[~ 56]
I can’t believe the boss would do this...\c\nYou quelled all those nobles’ frenzies under his\nown orders![VAR 0114(0006)]
I can’t believe the boss would do this...\c\nYou were acting on his own orders when you\nquelled the frenzied nobles...[VAR 0114(0007)]
Quite right! Moreover, even if you did happen\nto fall from the sky, that hardly gives you the\r\npower to turn it red![VAR 0114(0005)]
This is utterly intolerable—and, I might add,\nabsurdly unscientific!\c\nAs a man of science, I must fight such illogical\nthinking tooth and nail![VAR 0114(0005)]
You must not.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You will only cause [VAR 0100(0000)]\nmore\r\npain\r\nif you\r\nare\r\ndriven\r\nout\r\nas\r\nwell\r\nfor\r\ndefending h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer.[VAR 0114(0008)]
However, there are others who might offer help.\c\nYou’ve been an aid to both the Diamond Clan\nand the Pearl Clan.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Of course! Perhaps Adaman or Irida might take\nyou in?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Though I’m afraid they’ve both already returned\nto their respective settlements...[VAR 0114(0005)]
I bet you could at least start by finding Lian at\nGrandtree Arena. Not sure where Mai’d be, if\r\nyou want the Diamond Clan...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Perhaps you could try to go find Lian first? He’s\nlikely to be at Grandtree Arena.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Don’t die alone out there. That’s an order.\c\nI will ensure you have all you need to complete\nthe survey the commander has tasked you with.[VAR 0114(0008)]
If I might offer my advice.\c\nIn this life, you will meet with both admiration\nand abuse from others.\c\nHow others choose to view you is a choice only\nthey can make. You cannot make it for them.\c\nAll that truly matters is that you hold firm to your\nown values.[VAR 0114(0008)]
What of the dream I first shared with you on\nPrelude Beach? To complete the Pokédex?\r\nThat dream simply won’t come true without you...[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m sorry, but the commander’s orders are\nabsolute. I’m not allowed to help outsiders...
[~ 72]
You! What in the world did you do?![VAR 0114(0010)]
Look at the size of that rift!\c\nIf lightning starts pouring from it, all the Pokémon\nin Hisui could be thrown into a frenzy!\c\nThe entire clan is in a panic now![VAR 0114(0010)]
I should have known that the only thing that\ncould come from that rift was disaster...[VAR 0114(0010)]
I need help
Never mind, then...
Help?![VAR 0114(0010)]
Is that really all you came to say?[VAR 0114(0010)]
Ah. Well. That’s not exactly something I can do.\c\nIt’s not that I wouldn’t like to help you...but it\nwould put Irida in a difficult position.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Look... You needn’t try to put on a brave face.\c\nYou’ve been a help to the Pearl Clan, and we\nknow what kind of person you are.\c\nThough, it must be said—for every sympathetic\near you might find there, you may also find a\r\ndetractor who fears your presence...[VAR 0114(0010)]
I truly do wish that I could repay you for quelling\nKleavor’s frenzy as you did. You must know that.\r\nBut there’s nothing I alone can do for you.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Warden Mai might be able to help you, though.\nShe’s a caring woman, after all.[VAR 0114(0010)]
You’ll most likely find Mai at the Worn Bridge.\nI believe it’s a very significant place for her.[VAR 0114(0010)]
I’m certain that somewhere in the vastness of\nHisui, there is a place for you as well.[VAR 0114(0010)]
[~ 86]
My, my... What a frightful sky.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Such a disturbing sight would be enough to put\nanyone ill at ease.[VAR 0114(000F)]
You don’t know what brought this about, do you?[VAR 0114(000F)]
I don’t know...
I’m trying to find out
I suppose it was too much to expect that you\ncould already have an answer to all this.[VAR 0114(000F)]
I heard from our leader what happened. You\ncan’t return to that village of yours, can you?[VAR 0114(000F)]
But I’m afraid the Diamond Clan cannot be the\nones to save you.[VAR 0114(000F)]
The Diamond Clan could end up at war with the\nGalaxy Team if things went badly. I think you\r\nwould regret that as much as anyone.[VAR 0114(000F)]
The great Wyrdeer took a liking to you. I want to\noffer you my support. But...\c\nForgive me. I cannot help you in this.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Do not abandon hope. Time solves all things.\c\nAnd besides, you seem to have a talent for\nmaking your own way in the world. I have no\r\ndoubt you’ll continue to find a path to walk.[VAR 0114(000F)]
[~ 98]
Krrr!
Strange events seem to follow you wherever\nyou go, don’t they?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Found you at last, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000C)]
I’ve been looking all over for you, you know!\c\nWhat would I do if I were to lose one of my\nfavorite customers?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Don’t worry. I’ve already heard what happened.\c\nA good merchant knows well the importance of\nstaying abreast of all the latest news.[VAR 0114(000C)]
It seems you’re in quite the pinch. No place for\nyou among the Diamond Clan or the Pearl Clan—\c\nto say nothing of how poorly the Galaxy Team\nhas treated you![VAR 0114(000C)]
But not to worry.\c\nThere are still corners of the Hisui region where\nwe can stash you away in secret.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I know a spot that will be the perfect hideaway.\nLeave it all up to me![VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 107]
Here we are.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I know, I know—it’s no palace. But you know the\nsaying about beggars and choosers.[VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 110]
Shirking your work to come pester me again?\nEven beneath a bleeding sky, you never change.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Always a pleasure, Mistress Cogita.\c\nBut I’m afraid I’m not here today to learn more\nof Hisui’s myths and legends.[VAR 0114(000C)]
No “mistress,” thank you. Just Cogita.\nAnd this is?[VAR 0114(000D)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Why, [VAR 0100(0000)] is the [VAR 1100(00FF,0200)]woman of\nthe hour.\c\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe’s the one who quelled the frenzy of all the\nPokémon nobles, believe it or not.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Ah, the poor wretch you spoke of. Lost in time\nand space.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Dear me, lost one... It seems I’ll be able to fulfill\nmy duty at long last, thanks to you.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Lost one?
Duty?
Indeed—I am to guide you, lost one. For the task\nof preventing great disaster falls to you.\c\nThe rift in space-time must be mended, lest time\nand space themselves be thrown out of balance.[VAR 0114(000D)]
But come. You may enter my dear hideaway.\nThere’s much to be told.[VAR 0114(000D)]
[~ 121]
The space-time rift is said to be a portal to\ninnumerable other dimensions...[VAR 0114(000D)]
In one such realm, far and farther still from ours,\ndwells almighty Sinnoh.[VAR 0114(000D)]
The Diamond Clan’s...?
The Pearl Clan’s...?
The expanse from antiquity to eternity and the\nexpanse to all sides, above, and below...[VAR 0114(000D)]
Time traces the path we tread from the here and\nnow into the future...[VAR 0114(000D)]
While space yawns all-encompassingly,\nsurrounding us in every direction.[VAR 0114(000D)]
You see, don’t you? The two together, time and\nspace, comprise all creation—the universe.[VAR 0114(000D)]
How can one claim that either is greater than the\nother, as those two clans do?[VAR 0114(000D)]
You really can’t
They’re inseparable
Perhaps the truth is clearer to a wanderer such as\nyou—one who has known other ages.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Now listen, lost one. Here is what you must do.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Hisui holds three lakes of great importance—\nLake Verity, Lake Valor, and Lake Acuity.[VAR 0114(000D)]
At each dwells a Pokémon said to embody one\naspect of the mind.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Complete the trials each will set you, and bear\ntheir gifts to the Shrouded Ruins.\c\nThere you may receive the [VAR FF00(0006)]Red Chain[VAR FF00(0000)]. With it,\nperhaps you can bind the world together.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Bind the world, you say...? You mean it won’t\nclose the rift?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Kindly spare me your doubts, young man.\c\nI know the old words and what they bid us do.\nHow true they are isn’t mine to know.[VAR 0114(000D)]
And regardless of their truth, I am bound to pass\nthem on.\c\nHow callous of my ancestors—to leave their\nlegends to their children without a thought for\r\nthe hardship it would cause them![VAR 0114(000D)]
But...here we are. You know your duty, and you’ll\ndo it. Won’t you?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Of course!
I can’t possibly...
There is nobility in knowing what must be done\nand seeing to it.[VAR 0114(000D)]
What twaddle!\c\nYou would abandon the people and the\nPokémon that have cared for you? I doubt it.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Your Arc Phone is beeping...
You can see the locations of three lakes marked\non your Arc Phone.
Mistress Cogita’s got a lovely workbench here.\c\nAnd if you need materials, I’d be glad to help.\nI’m always happy to do business with you.[VAR 0114(000C)]
What about the pastures?
I’ll need to rest, too...
[~ 151]
Ah, that is a problem, isn’t it? What shall we do\nabout that, indeed?[VAR 0114(000C)]
No need to worry about that! If you don’t draw\ntoo much attention, I imagine you could steal a\r\nbit of shut-eye at one of the base camps...[VAR 0114(000C)]
Abaaa.
What was that cry? Have we now a lost Pokémon\nas well as a lost child? Do see to it, please.[VAR 0114(000D)]
How could I refuse you, ma’am?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Off we go, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 158]
Hello, hello! It’s an Abra! Where did you teleport\nin from, little fellow?[VAR 0114(000C)]
And it’s got a letter... A letter addressed to\nyou, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000C)]
You take a closer look at the letter...
“To [VAR 0100(0000)]:\nYou may use my Pokémon as a go-between to\r\naccess the pastures in Jubilife Village.\c\n“I’ve also ensured that you’ll be able to utilize\nour base camps without issue.\c\n“I have every confidence in your ability as an\nadept Survey Corps member to bring this bizarre\r\nsituation under control promptly.\c\n“Sincerely,\nCyllene\r\nSurvey Corps Captain, Galaxy Expedition Team”
Good tidings from the letter, then?[VAR 0114(000C)]
That’s right
It’s a secret!
Now then... So we’re to visit three lakes?\c\nIt doesn’t sound like an easy task—that’s for sure.\nIt sure would be wonderful to have a kind soul\r\nwho might help us out...[VAR 0114(000C)]
Quite the opportunist, aren’t you, Volo?\nSuch a consummate guild merchant.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ve managed to reassure my people for now.\c\nThe wardens are keeping a close eye on their\nnobles, too. Seems all’s quiet for the moment.\r\nAnd so...here we are![VAR 0114(000A)]
But still...we’ll never get away with openly\naiding you.[VAR 0114(000A)]
If we were to undermine the commander’s direct\norders, relations would grow...strained.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Long story short: we want to help but without\ndrawing attention, so it’ll be just one of us.\c\nMe or her—it’s up to you. Though the answer\nshould be obvious![VAR 0114(000A)]
[~ 172]
Obviously you’ll choose me, right?\c\nWho gave you that Celestica Flute in the first\nplace? That’s right—this strapping young man![VAR 0114(000A)]
Yeah, I choose you
Let me think it over
Of course you’ll choose me!\c\nI was the one who got you what you needed\nwhen you first set out to quell Kleavor. You and I\r\nmade his balms together![VAR 0114(000B)]
Yeah, I choose you
Let me think it over
Thought so. You can count on me![VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Just what I would expect of you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nYou made the right choice. You won’t regret it.[VAR 0114(000B)]
So, then, the leftover leader will...?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Leftover? I’m not someone’s scraps!\c\nI will keep watch on the commander. I imagine I’ll\nhear something useful from him.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Leftover? Think again.\c\n[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)] trusts me enough\nto\r\nleave\r\nthe\r\ntough\r\njob\r\nup to\r\nme alone.\c\nI’ll be keeping an eye on the commander, so I\ncan let you all know if anything happens.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Of course, of course...\c\nAnd the lucky chosen one comes with us to the\nlakes. We can fill you in on the details as we go.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Well, the first task will be to decide which of the\nHisui region’s three great lakes to visit first.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 186]
[~ 187]
[~ 188]
[~ 189]
[~ 190]
Right—and we’d better get a move on!\nNo time to waste![VAR 0114(000A)]
I’ll meet you wherever we decide to go. We’d be\nin hot water if we were seen traveling together.[VAR 0114(000A)]
But yes, we should get moving![VAR 0114(000B)]
I’d rather we walk this road together, but if the\ncommander were to get wind of it, it would only\r\nmake things worse...\c\nI’ll meet you at whichever lake we choose![VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I’m counting on you to handle this, Adaman.\nDon’t cause [VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nmore trouble.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]All right, Irida...\nYou and [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nWell, you two do what needs doing.[VAR 0114(000A)]
So, where are you headed?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Where will you be heading?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Something you need? Well, you’ve come to\nthe right place! I am a Ginkgo Guild merchant,\r\nafter all![VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 200]
They say this lake actually used to be a volcano.\c\nThen it erupted, leaving a huge crater that filled\nwith water. And so Lake Verity was born.[VAR 0114(000C)]
It is protected by a Pokémon called Mesprit.\c\nIt was when Mesprit took flight that people first\nlearned the joys and sorrows of living.\r\nOr that’s how the old tales go, anyway.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Your Arc Phone is beeping...
Th-that cave—it just...appeared from nowhere!\c\nIs that the Arc Phone the professor was going\non about?[VAR 0114(000C)]
And another cave appears...\c\nYou know, I was too busy being amazed to\nmention this before, but the professor was right!\r\nThat Arc Phone of yours is incredible![VAR 0114(000C)]
Let’s do this, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000A)]
What surprises wait within, I wonder...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Mistress Cogita seemed quite intent that you\nwould have to prove yourself to all three of\r\nthe Pokémon that guard these lakes...\c\nThis challenge was never for the faint of heart.[VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 209]
There’s something about this place I can’t quite\nput into words...[VAR 0114(000A)]
The air feels somehow tense in here...[VAR 0114(000B)]
A menacing Pokémon stands before you!
[VAR BD06(0000)]Trounce that thing, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nProve\r\nto\r\nthe\r\nPokémon\r\nof\r\nthe\r\nlake\r\nhow\r\nstrong\r\nyou are![VAR 0114(000A)]
You and your Pokémon quelled Hisui’s nobles.\nYou can handle any battle, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 215]
Goooooo!
[~ 217]
That’s the way, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nI can tell by watching that you and the Pokémon\nyou’ve caught in those little balls truly understand\r\none another.\c\nNow, let’s see about the Pokémon of the lake...[VAR 0114(000A)]
It’s curious, but when I watch you and your\nPokémon battle...\c\nI feel as if there’s no obstacle that can’t be\novercome if people and Pokémon work together.\c\nNow, let’s see about the Pokémon of the lake...[VAR 0114(000B)]
You feel a mysterious presence...
Kyauun!
[~ 222]
Y o u r   e m o t i o n s . . .   S h a r e   t h e m\nw i t h   m e . . .[VAR 0114(0004)]
They’re yours
Not a chance
So it speaks from its mind straight to yours...\nMakes sense for a Pokémon that embodies an\r\naspect of the mind, I guess.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I can only imagine how it must feel to speak\ndirectly with a Pokémon like that.[VAR 0114(000B)]
W h e n   y o u   f e l l   t o   t h i s   l a n d ,\nw h a t   s t i r r e d   i n   y o u r   h e a r t ?[VAR 0114(0004)]

[~ 245]
Kyauun!
I can’t even imagine what that must feel like,\nhaving a Pokémon talk to you without words...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Well, the world’s full of mysteries, I guess.\c\nI can hardly even be surprised at things like these\nafter seeing the sky itself so warped.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Now, we’ve two lakes left to visit.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Still one lake left... This is taking more time than\nI’d expected.[VAR 0114(000A)]
That was the third trial, which means... That’s it,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]! You’ve done it![VAR 0114(000A)]
I know that Pokémon spoke with you, yet the\nwords did not reach my ears...[VAR 0114(000B)]
It’s mysterious, but...I suppose when dealing with\nsomeone who fell from the sky, it’s only natural\r\nto encounter mystery.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Next, on to Lake Valor and Lake Acuity.[VAR 0114(000B)]
One more lake to go. This trek around Hisui has\nreally brought home how vast it is.[VAR 0114(000B)]
That’s all three lakes behind us. I wonder what\nour next stop will bring...[VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 257]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Looks like that worked out well,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000C)]
Gotta admit—you sure know plenty about\nHisui, Volo.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I must say...you know an awful lot about Hisui,\nVolo. I suppose a merchant like you sees all sorts\r\nof things in their travels.[VAR 0114(000B)]
That’s right!\c\nYou could say it’s because I’m a merchant, but\nmostly I’m just naturally filled with curiosity![VAR 0114(000C)]
I want to know exactly what happened in the past\nthat led us to this particular present...[VAR 0114(000C)]
Or more accurately, I suppose...\c\nI want to know where I came from and where\nI’m headed. I want to know my path, so to speak.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I think we’d all like some answers on that.\c\nI don’t properly know how we came to worship\nalmighty Sinnoh in the first place. I’ve even\r\ngot some questions about its...true nature.[VAR 0114(000A)]
The same goes for me.\c\nOur clan settled at the very spot where our\nforebears once beheld almighty Sinnoh.\c\nBut I...I have still never seen almighty Sinnoh\nfor myself...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Weighty matters to ponder, for sure. But we have\nan important task before us!\c\nDo you want to return to Mistress Cogita’s home?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Let’s go back
I’ll stay here
Perfect! I’d like to see what she thinks of\nour progress.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Then we’ll go ahead and see you there when you\njoin us.[VAR 0114(000C)]
It seems we’ve finished the three lake trials!\c\nIf I remember correctly, we were told to then\nhead for the Shrouded Ruins...[VAR 0114(000C)]
I don’t know what could await us there, but I’m\nalways excited to explore some ancient ruins!\r\nLet us be on our way![VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 273]
Ahh, [VAR 0109(0001)]...\c\nSo the legends told it true. Then the Red Chain\nmust be real as well.[VAR 0114(000D)]
I guess... But this all makes no sense to me.\c\nThese Pokémon represent our minds, and they’ll\ngive us this thing...and it’ll let us bind the world\r\nand solve all this mess? But...how? Why?[VAR 0114(000A)]
I beg your pardon, Cogita, ma’am...\c\nBut what do these Pokémon that represent the\nmind have to do with this Red Chain? And why\r\nexactly should it bind the world?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Your doubt suggests a keen intellect. I see you’re\nnot your clan’s leader for nothing.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Without the mind, were the rift to widen and the\nvery world to end, would we even know it?[VAR 0114(000D)]
One might even say the world—time, space, all\ncreation—exists only because our minds are there\r\nto perceive it.\c\nPerhaps the Red Chain’s purpose is to let one see\ncreation as it truly is.[VAR 0114(000D)]
I get it even less now![VAR 0114(000A)]
I... What? So does the mind create the world?\nBut isn’t it the other way around? Or is it...?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Such are myths, my child... Teaching us about the\nworld in their own incomprehensible ways.\c\nThey urge us to think more for ourselves—on the\nnature of almighty Sinnoh and on the nature of\r\nthe world in which we dwell.[VAR 0114(000D)]
You’re absolutely right! Myths and legends are\nsuch fascinating things to study!\c\nIn any case, all we have to do is complete two\nmore trials and we will get the Red Chain![VAR 0114(000C)]
How nonchalant you sound. How confident of\nsuccesses to which you contribute nothing.\c\nYou tag along only for the chance to gawk at\nmore ancient ruins.[VAR 0114(000D)]
With this sky...I don’t know how long we have.\c\nI don’t mean to rush you, but we probably don’t\nhave the time to be dawdling.[VAR 0114(000A)]
It seems meaningful somehow where the three\nlakes are placed in vast Hisui, don’t you think?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Falter not, lost one.[VAR 0114(000D)]
I wonder what the next Pokémon will be like![VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 289]
Do you know about Lake Valor?\c\nIt’s said to have been formed by a volcanic\neruption, much like Lake Verity.\c\nThough there are also other theories that say it\nwas carved out in the midst of a Pokémon battle.[VAR 0114(000C)]
This lake is protected by the Pokémon Azelf.\c\nWhen Azelf took flight, the will to do what needs\ndoing was born in people’s hearts...or that is what\r\nlegend would have us believe.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Your Arc Phone is beeping...
Ho! A cave appears where there was none—\nas if just for [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000C)]
In we go, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000A)]
Let’s head in, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000B)]
I imagine strong Pokémon could wait inside,\nprotecting the Pokémon of the lake. Take care![VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 297]
Let’s see what we’re up against.[VAR 0114(000A)]
What an eerie space... Why would there be\ncolumns inside a cave, anyway?[VAR 0114(000B)]
A menacing Pokémon waits before you!
Watch it, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nI’ve heard about this one from my grandfather.\nThose quills—they’re venomous![VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Watch yourself, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nThose\r\nquills\r\nlook vicious![VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 303]
Fishimiiiiii!
[~ 305]
That’s my [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000A)]
I knew you could do it, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000B)]
Kyuuun!
S h o w   t o   m e   u n y i e l d i n g   w i l l .\nS t r i k e   m e ,   i f   y o u   c a n .
Did those balms just...appear out of nowhere?\nI guess you’re meant to throw them at Azelf...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Wait...balms?! Are you meant to try to hit Azelf\nwith them, then?[VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 312]
You seem to hear a voice inside your head...
W i l l   y o u   a b a n d o n   t h i s   f o l l y ?[VAR 0114(0004)]

I’m not through yet
I’m done with this
Need to take a moment and try again?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Are you going to retire, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000B)]
All right. Just remember—preparation’s vital, but\nso is persistence.[VAR 0114(000A)]
It might be good to collect yourself, yes. But I\ndon’t think you’re the type to give up halfway.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 323]
Kyuuun!
T a k e   t h i s   p i e c e   o f   t h e   s p i r i t\nt o   b i n d   t h e   w o r l d   o n c e   m o r e .[VAR 0114(0004)]
Two more to go now![VAR 0114(000A)]
Just one more to go.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Looks like our lake journey’s complete![VAR 0114(000A)]
That looked exhausting... But we still have two\nmore trials to go.[VAR 0114(000B)]
That looked exhausting... But only one more to\ngo now.[VAR 0114(000B)]
That looked exhausting... But now we’ve\njourneyed to all three lakes![VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 332]
I assume all went well, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000C)]
Still, I must wonder... Why don’t they just give us\nthe Red Chain? Why all this running about?[VAR 0114(000C)]
I guess I can think of two reasons: to keep the\nchain safe—and to test us.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Perhaps they mean to test whether whoever seeks\nit is worthy?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Perhaps you are right... Who knows what would\nhappen if it fell into the wrong hands, after all.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Though having said that—isn’t the Red Chain for\nmending the world? What use would some villain\r\nhave for it?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Though on the other hand... What use would\nthose wrong hands have for it?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Who can say for sure? Maybe the Red Chain\nhas some other use besides mending the world.[VAR 0114(000C)]
You could well be right.\c\nI guess we’ll have no way of knowing until we\nget the Red Chain for ourselves.[VAR 0114(000A)]
The Red Chain’s as mysterious as this entire\npredicament we’re in...\c\nBut if we continue visiting the lakes, we’ll get\ncloser to an answer![VAR 0114(000B)]
So...shall we return to Mistress Cogita’s home?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Let’s go back
I’ll stay here
Wonderful! Then we can see if Mistress Cogita\nhas any more insights to share with us.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Then we’ll go ahead and see you there when you\njoin us.[VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 348]
[VAR BD06(0000)]So that’s [VAR 0109(0001)]... I sense a\nwarmth\r\nto it.[VAR 0114(000D)]
The Pokémon of the lakes are...strange.\nThey seem to play on your mind somehow.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I do have to wonder if anyone else has ever\ncompleted the trials of these lake Pokémon...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Indeed. Yet we may want to add just a dash more\nspeed. Things in Jubilife Village are...tense.[VAR 0114(000C)]
What makes you say so?[VAR 0114(000D)]
It seems a Pokémon’s been glimpsed on the other\nside of the rift.\c\nOne of those Ginkgo Guild merchants informed\nme that Commander Kamado has raised a force—\r\nnot to survey the Pokémon but to subdue it,\r\nshould the need arise.[VAR 0114(000C)]
“One of those Ginkgo Guild merchants”?\nYou make it sound as if you’re not one of them.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Now if—IF—a Pokémon truly were to appear\nfrom beyond the rift...\c\nWhat would become of everyone, I wonder?[VAR 0114(000C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]That settles it, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nThere’s no time\r\nto lose!\c\nWe’ve got one material left to find for the Red\nChain—let’s go get it![VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Don’t let Hisui’s great vastness stop you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nLet’s go get the final item we need![VAR 0114(000B)]
That’s the spirit! I’ll come watch this historic\nmoment unfold, too.[VAR 0114(000C)]
“Watch”? Is that all you really do?\c\nRemember: once you’ve sought the third lake\nand found what’s needed for the Red Chain,\r\nmake for the Shrouded Ruins.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Time to move—this is an emergency!\c\nStill, I can’t deny that there’s a certain thrill to\nadventuring with you, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000A)]
We’ve a saying in the Pearl Clan: “When you\nknow your destination, no hesitation.”[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m watching history itself unfold! A new page in\nthe myths of Hisui![VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 364]
Here we are: Lake Acuity! You know, I’ve been\ntold it actually contains seawater as well.\c\nNobody knows why, though—it could be a fluke\nof geography, or perhaps it’s connected to a\r\nPokémon somehow.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Lake Acuity is protected by the Pokémon Uxie.\c\nWhen Uxie took flight, the knowledge to solve\nproblems was born in people’s minds.\r\nThat’s what the stories say, anyway.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Your Arc Phone is beeping...
A tool that can make caves simply appear from\nnowhere is quite a handy one to have![VAR 0114(000C)]
Let’s go, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000A)]
I wonder what waits inside...[VAR 0114(000B)]
I imagine there may be Pokémon in there,\nprotecting the lake’s guardian. Take care.[VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 372]
Now let’s see what’s waiting for us...[VAR 0114(000A)]
I sense a chill in the air... What is this?[VAR 0114(000B)]
A menacing Pokémon stands before you!
Kowowww!
[VAR BD06(0000)]I know you don’t need me to tell you this,\n[VAR 0100(0000)],\r\nbut I’ve\r\nstill\r\ngot to\r\nsay it...\r\nBe careful\r\naround\r\nthat thing![VAR 0114(000A)]
Could...could that be the dreaded Baneful Fox?[VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 379]
Kowowww!
[~ 381]
Knew you could do it, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000A)]
The Baneful Fox... It is a Pokémon said to be\nfilled with malice. We were told stories about it\r\nas children.[VAR 0114(000B)]
You feel a mysterious presence...
Kyouuuun!
That Pokémon—is it Uxie? The one Volo was\ntalking about?[VAR 0114(000A)]
That Pokémon that’s appeared—could it be the\none Volo mentioned? Uxie?[VAR 0114(000B)]

A n s w e r   m e   t r u e ,   i f   a n s w e r\ny o u   w o u l d .[VAR 0114(0004)]
So the Pokémon of the lake is testing\nyour knowledge?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Well, if you’re asked a question, you’ve got\nto answer. Simple as that.[VAR 0114(000A)]
You and that brainiac Mr. Professor have studied\nPokémon like mad, right? Should be easy.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Ah, I can’t stand being put on the spot with\nimpossible questions...\c\nI had to answer so many hard questions before\nI was chosen to become the leader of the clan.\r\nI shudder even at the memory...[VAR 0114(000B)]
But you’re in the Survey Corps! I’m sure\neverything you need is in your head![VAR 0114(000B)]
Just come up with the best answer you can, then\nspeak with the Pokémon of the lake again.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 402]
Kyouuuun!
T a k e   t h i s   p i e c e   o f   t h e   s p i r i t\nt o   b i n d   t h e   w o r l d   o n c e   m o r e .
That’s it! You’ve completed the trials of the\nthree lakes![VAR 0114(000A)]
Amazing! You cleared all three trials of the lakes!\nYou really are a wonder![VAR 0114(000B)]
Just one more to go.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Goodness, that was tricky! But only one more to\ngo now.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Two more to go.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Goodness, that was tricky! But we still have two\nmore trials to go.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 411]
The Shrouded Ruins...[VAR 0114(000C)]
Mist is so very good at obscuring things. It’s long\nbeen said to blur boundaries...[VAR 0114(000C)]
If we’re to somehow bring together the world of\nhumans, the world of Pokémon, and the world of\r\nmyth...then maybe we need a setting such as this.[VAR 0114(000C)]
That being said...what are we meant to do now?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Seems I’ve made it in time.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Showing up only when the time’s right, huh?\nWith age comes wisdom, I guess.[VAR 0114(000A)]
You arrived just when we’d assembled all three\ngifts... Did you somehow see our progress across\r\nthe distance dividing us?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I had the aid of a rather remarkable Pokémon,\nif you really wish to know.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Right. But how do we make this Red Chain?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Could you mean...that Pokémon that flits about\nthe Hisui region?\c\nAh, but never mind that now. What about the\nRed Chain? How are we to forge it?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I would hardly know.[VAR 0114(000D)]
We speak of a divine instrument—one said to be\ncapable of binding the very world.\c\nDo you really imagine it can be forged by\nmortal hands?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Then what are we doing here? We don’t have any\nmore time to waste![VAR 0114(000A)]
Then what are we to do? Search the entire\nvastness of Hisui for the answer?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Kyouuuun!
Kyauun!
Kyuuun!
Ah... The Pokémon of the lakes![VAR 0114(000D)]
You received the Red Chain!
So it was true... The pact our people have passed\ndown for all these generations has been kept.\r\nAt last, I can set this burden aside![VAR 0114(000D)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You’ve succeeded once again,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000C)]
Yet...things do not seem to be going so well for\nthe rest of the world.[VAR 0114(000C)]
What’s that supposed to mean?[VAR 0114(000A)]
What have you heard now?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ve had some news from my fellow merchants in\nthe Ginkgo Guild...\c\nIt seems that the commander is going to forgo\nwaiting for our investigation to finish. He plans to\r\nclimb Mount Coronet himself.[VAR 0114(000C)]
What’s he thinking?! Even if he makes it up there,\nwhat can he do against a giant rift in space-time?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Has he lost his senses?\c\nHe plans to get close to the rift? To study\nit himself?[VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Well, he doesn’t yet know that our\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nhas\r\nmanaged\r\nto get\r\nthe\r\nRed Chain,\r\nnow,\r\ndoes he?[VAR 0114(000C)]
That’s right! We’ve got to let him know that it’ll\nbe all right now that we have the Red Chain.\c\nEven the commander should see reason then and\ncall off this foolhardy plan of his.[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]That’s true! There’s no way he could.\c\nWe need to tell him about the chain—and about\neverything [VAR 0100(0000)] has\r\nachieved—before\r\nhe sets out![VAR 0114(000B)]

I-I mean, of course you are! I knew you’d be\nall right![VAR 0114(0006)]
Wait one second! I’ll go let the captain and the\nprofessor know you’re back![VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]?![VAR 0114(0007)]
Welcome back![VAR 0114(0007)]
It’s been grim here. We in the Survey Corps\nhardly even speak to one another lately...[VAR 0114(0007)]
But with you back, maybe Captain Cyllene’s\nappetite for potato mochi will return![VAR 0114(0007)]
Anyway, wait here a minute, will you? I’ll go and\nlet the captain know you’re back.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Oh, my dear [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Professor... I know you’ve been worried about\n[VAR 0100(0000)], but there’s no\r\nneed\r\nto cry![VAR 0114(0006)]
The professor has been awfully worried about\nyou, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0007)]
I’m n-not crying! Do not mock your elders, if you\nplease, Rei! *sniffle*\c\nAnd besides, weren’t you the one who couldn’t\nget a wink of sleep from all your worrying over\r\nour friend?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Of course I was worried! But I don’t think I could\nhold a candle to the distress you showed, Akari.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Y-you didn’t have to tell her that![VAR 0114(0006)]
Just ignore him, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nAnyway, where’s Captain Cyllene? Wasn’t she\ncoming with you, Professor?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Th-that’s blowing it out of proportion!\c\nI don’t think it’s appropriate for an adult to make\nthings up just to hide their embarrassment.[VAR 0114(0007)]
But, um, where is the captain? Wasn’t she coming\nalong with you, Professor?[VAR 0114(0007)]
She’s buried under a mound of work, I’m afraid.\nWe’re to join her in the Survey Corps office.\c\nIt seems her hands are more than full now that\nCommander Kamado’s gone.[VAR 0114(0005)]
The commander’s gone?
He’s not here?
Well, he set out for Mount Coronet with the\nSecurity Corps in tow.\c\nHe’s determined to handle this whole space-time\nrift business himself...including dealing with the\r\nPokémon that’s been spotted on the other side.[VAR 0114(0005)]
And since I’m such a fine fellow, I took over\nwatching the gate for the Security Corps folks.[VAR 0114(0006)]
That’s why I was filling in for the regular guards,\nwith Pikachu at the ready.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Well, we aren’t getting anywhere out here.\nLet’s head inside and report to the captain.[VAR 0114(0005)]
In strange, upended times like these, our survey\nwork is more vital than ever! Care to report on\r\nyour progress?[VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 27]
So you managed not to die. Just as I ordered.\nWell done.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Thanks to you, Captain
I owe it to Adaman
I owe it to Irida
I have no idea what you’re implying.\c\nAll I know is Abra vanished of its own accord—\ninconveniencing me greatly.[VAR 0114(0008)]
No doubt your own past deeds earned you any\nhelp you may have received.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Before moving forward, I must ask...\c\nI assume that you are here again because you’ve\nmanaged to learn something of use?[VAR 0114(0008)]
I visited these lakes...
I got this Red Chain...
...Go on.[VAR 0114(0008)]
You explain about the Red Chain you obtained.
A legendary tool said to bind the very world...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Commander Kamado is no longer here in\nJubilife Village.[VAR 0114(0008)]
The Security Corps had been scouting the area\nnear the space-time rift...and they reported\r\nsightings of something on the other side of it.\r\nSomething that resembled a Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0008)]
The commander made the decision to take the\nSecurity Corps to the mountain so as to prepare\r\nto fend off any possible threat.\c\nThey were to make for the temple at the peak.[VAR 0114(0008)]
The boss may be tough, but it still seems like a\nbad idea to do something so risky without\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)]’s help...[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]However strong the commander himself may be,\nhe should’ve gotten [VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nto help...[VAR 0114(0007)]
As the captain of the Survey Corps, I hereby\norder you to proceed as follows.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nTake that Red Chain to Mount Coronet, make\nyour way to the peak, and put an end to all this.\r\nYou are officially reinstated at your former rank.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Are you sure, Captain? The boss isn’t around to\napprove that...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Are you certain you can do that with the\ncommander away, Captain?[VAR 0114(0007)]
If he didn’t wish me to decide things in his place,\nthen he should not have left me in charge here![VAR 0114(0008)]
Then I’ll go as well![VAR 0114(0005)]
We’re all in this together, we members of the\nSurvey Corps![VAR 0114(0005)]
Naturally. No one suggested you should not.[VAR 0114(0008)]
But try to retain your composure, if you can.\nAllowing your emotions to run amok will only\r\nmake you vulnerable.[VAR 0114(0008)]
What kind of scientist would I be if I missed out\non this chance at field research?\c\nFret not, my [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl—I’ll be sure not to trip you up\nonce the Poké Balls start flying![VAR 0114(0005)]
Um... Maybe you and me should follow behind\nand let the battle-ready lead the way, Professor.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I...don’t think you should be in the vanguard,\nProfessor. Why don’t you and I follow behind?[VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 57]
[VAR BD06(0000)]There you are, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nIrida’s\r\nalready\r\nheaded\r\nto\r\nMount\r\nCoronet.\r\nHow’re\r\nthings\r\nlooking here?[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Did you find the commander,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000B)]
The commander is already at Mount Coronet.[VAR 0114(0008)]
He’s already started up the mountain?! He must\nbe more reckless than that dignified manner of\r\nhis lets on.\c\nNot that I can blame anyone for wanting to avoid\nwasting time.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Well, all right, then! Guess I’m going after him.[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Let me go first, [VAR 0100(0000)]. If you\nwere\r\nto\r\nshow\r\nup\r\nwith\r\nno\r\nwarning,\r\nthere’d\r\nprobably\r\nbe a fight!\c\nTime’s a-wasting. See you there![VAR 0114(000A)]
Already?! How could a grown man like\nCommander Kamado be so reckless?[VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]First expelling you, [VAR 0100(0000)], and\nnow\r\nthis!\r\nI think\r\nhe needs\r\na stern\r\ntalking to![VAR 0114(000B)]
As the leader of the Pearl Clan, loyal to almighty\nSinnoh who reigns over all space...\c\nI can go anywhere in vast Hisui that I please—\nand now I am going to go stop the commander![VAR 0114(000B)]
Hmph. Who is the reckless one?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Hey, you got run out of the village, right? But\nyou...still tried to find a way to help us all?
Thanks! Here, take this!
[VAR BD06(0000)]That’s right. [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]\nworked\r\nhard\r\nto get\r\nthat\r\nRed\r\nChain\r\nto\r\nhelp everybody.[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]That’s right! [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]\nworked\r\nhard\r\nto get\r\nthat\r\nRed\r\nChain\r\nto\r\nhelp us.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Too right—and a fine job [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she did, too!\c\nThe Survey Corps is always hard at work for the\nsake of everyone here in the village—as well as\r\nfor the sake of our relations with Pokémon![VAR 0114(0005)]
Your orders are three.[VAR 0114(0008)]
One: Make for the Summit Camp and, from\nthere, the Temple of Sinnoh.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Two: Use the Red Chain to resolve this mess.[VAR 0114(0008)]
And three: Return here...alive![VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 77]
I’ve heard the latest. So you’ve been accepted\nback into the Galaxy Team, have you?[VAR 0114(000C)]
I suppose congratulations are in order! Here,\nsome Max Potions from me to celebrate![VAR 0114(000C)]
It looks like the big moment is upon us at last.\c\nBut no doubt it’ll be fine! After all, you worked\nso hard to earn that Red Chain.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Both Adaman and Irida have headed to the peak\nas well.[VAR 0114(000C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]My good friend [VAR 0100(0000)].\nI wish\r\nyou\r\ngreat\r\nfortune\r\nin the\r\nbattles\r\nto come.\c\nI would truly regret losing one of our most\nbeloved and loyal customers.[VAR 0114(000C)]
It seems Kamado intends to use the Summit Camp\nas a base of operations for this undertaking.\c\nAs for me, I think I will set up shop closer to the\ntemple itself.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Things certainly seem to have gotten out of hand.\c\nWell, if anything goes wrong, the great Melli will\nbe here...for moral support, at least.[VAR 0114(0016)]
[~ 85]
This is the Stone Portal. I’ve been told not to let\nanyone pass.
This is the Stone Portal. I’ve been told not to let\nanyone pass.\c\nBut really, I’m not sure what the point is any\nlonger... Think you could go ask for me?
Oho. Still alive and kicking?[VAR 0114(000E)]
Sorry about having to shutter the Wallflower. I’d\nmuch rather be there now, serving up some\r\nfreshly grilled potato mochi.[VAR 0114(000E)]
But that taskmaster Kamado’s gone and left me\nto oversee our food supply. He always finds a\r\nway to put even these old bones to work...[VAR 0114(000E)]
While I’m handling that, I suppose I’ll handle you\nas well. Time we got rid of you once and for all.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Are you serious?
I don’t understand
I’ll make myself plain. As Kamado’s right hand,\nI’m charged with executing all the gritty deeds\r\nKamado can’t or won’t do himself.\c\nI gave him my word I’d get rid of any fools that\nmight dream of getting in the way of his plans.[VAR 0114(000E)]
And besides, it’s not just Kamado who longs to\nlive in a new home free of fear or strife.\c\nHis dream is mine now, too.[VAR 0114(000E)]
You’ve seen my Smoke Bombs before, right?\nWell, this is how you’re meant to use them![VAR 0114(000E)]
[~ 97]
When I heard you managed to quell those nobles\none after another, oh, did it ever make my blood\r\nrun hot and my heart pound...\c\nAt last...at last...[VAR 0114(000E)]
One final opponent worthy of my great ninja\ntechniques that have been left to molder all\r\nthese long years![VAR 0114(000E)]
[~ 100]
Very good, young one. Very good indeed.[VAR 0114(000E)]
It’s only a foolish ninja who tries to keep after a\ntarget they know they cannot beat...[VAR 0114(000E)]
And to be honest, I don’t hate you. Might\nactually like you, after a fashion.\c\nAt least for the skill you show in battle.[VAR 0114(000E)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]But listen well, [VAR 0100(0000)]:\nPokémon\r\nare\r\ntruly\r\nterrifying creatures.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Kamado and I saw our hometown burned to the\nground by maddened Pokémon running amok—\r\nwe lost plenty of friends and comrades that day.[VAR 0114(000E)]
That’s why Kamado came here to Hisui to try to\nbuild a new home where people could live free\r\nfrom fear.\c\nBut to achieve something truly great, you\nsometimes have to take extreme actions.[VAR 0114(000E)]
If—hypothetical as it may be—a Pokémon were\nto appear from within that space-time rift...\r\nKamado might lose hold of his reason.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Save Kamado from himself. By force, if you must.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Do that, and I’ll stuff you full of more delicious\npotato mochi than a human stomach can handle.[VAR 0114(000E)]
[~ 110]
Well, this is it. Have you bought everything\nyou need?[VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 112]
You’ve brought the Red Chain?[VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]...\nYou’re\r\nthe\r\nonly\r\none\r\nwho\r\ncan\r\nstop\r\nwhatever\r\nis\r\nunfolding\r\natop\r\nthe mountain.[VAR 0114(000B)]
That Pokémon that’s apparently been sighted\nthrough the rift...\r\nI...I think it may be almighty Sinnoh.\c\nBut Commander Kamado stopped us from\nheading toward the temple.[VAR 0114(000A)]
You’d better take that Red Chain up to the top\nof the mountain.[VAR 0114(000A)]
That Pokémon threatening to descend on the\npeak any moment now... I think...it may be\r\nalmighty Sinnoh.\c\nBut all this has to be stopped, and you’re the\nonly one who can do it![VAR 0114(000A)]
Almighty Sinnoh seems to be nearly here, but still\nthe commander obstructs us...[VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 119]
You again...[VAR 0114(0009)]
I’ve heard that this Red Chain of yours will “bind\nthe world.”\c\nI assume that to bind the world means to hold\nthe world together, keeping it as it’s meant to be.\r\nA welcome idea...but can I truly put my faith in\r\nsuch tales?[VAR 0114(0009)]
Of course!
Trust me
What—do you think even the Red Chain is some\ntrick on [VAR 0100(0000)]’s part?\c\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe worked mightily to get that thing, and I\nshould know—I was with h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer the whole time!\r\nI saw h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer rise to the trials set by the three\r\nPokémon of the lakes!\c\nIf [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she somehow concocted all of that on h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser own,\nthen what hope do we even have anyway?[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Commander, please! Be reasonable!\c\nI understand that you’re bound to protect your\npeople as commander of the Galaxy Expedition\r\nTeam—I have the same duty toward my clan.\c\nBut doubting [VAR 0100(0000)] like\nthis...\r\nYou’re\r\nnot\r\njust\r\nwrong—you’re\r\na fool![VAR 0114(000B)]
...Perhaps you are right.\c\nBut if I were to simply place my faith in this [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl,\nand that faith were to be betrayed, then how\r\ncould I possibly face my people?[VAR 0114(0009)]
Then work together with us! Should something go\nwrong, I’ll take complete responsibility![VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You may think you’re the only one desperate to\nprotect the people of Jubilife, but you’re not!\r\n[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)] is putting h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser life on\r\nthe\r\nline\r\nas well![VAR 0114(000B)]
Fine! Enough![VAR 0114(0009)]
Let fate decide what happens next! Whichever of\nus is stronger will prevail![VAR 0114(0009)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Face me with your Pokémon,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\r\nToday\r\nwe battle\r\nin earnest![VAR 0114(0009)]
[~ 132]
You truly are a force to be reckoned with...[VAR 0114(0009)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]...\nThe fates have\r\ndecided.\r\nI concede...\r\nAnd\r\nI apologize\r\nsincerely\r\nfor\r\ndoubting you![VAR 0114(0009)]
Commander...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Commander Kamado...[VAR 0114(000B)]
I know I have no right to ask it of you any longer,\nbut please use that strength of yours for the sake\r\nof the Galaxy Expedition Team—\c\nNo! For the sake of the Celestica people and all\nthe Pokémon living in Hisui.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Don’t you worry, Commander. We’ve got the\nRed Chain![VAR 0114(000A)]
[~ 139]
[~ 140]
[~ 141]
[~ 142]
[~ 143]
The commander’s headed to the temple, but...\nI fear the situation’s already beyond our control...[VAR 0114(001B)]
Can you feel that staggering power weighing you\ndown? I doubt any human has a chance against it.[VAR 0114(00DA)]
Beyond that space-time rift...\c\nIt seems there’s a being that has no regard for\nour very existence out there.[VAR 0114(00DB)]
[~ 147]
The moment has come...[VAR 0114(0009)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You can do this, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nI believe\r\nin you![VAR 0114(000B)]
I wonder just what is happening on the other side\nof the space-time rift...[VAR 0114(000A)]
It’s time to use the Red Chain! Let’s see what it\ncan do![VAR 0114(000B)]
Hold on a sec...[VAR 0114(000A)]
My head... Something’s talking...inside my head![VAR 0114(000A)]
“You hold...the Red Chain... Try to catch me,\nthen, human!”[VAR 0114(000A)]
A-Adaman? What are you saying? What do you\nmean, catch you?![VAR 0114(000B)]
Almighty Sinnoh?! I-I think almighty Sinnoh just\nspoke to me![VAR 0114(000A)]
It’s telling me...\c\n“You hold...the Red Chain... Try to catch me,\nthen, human! For the fight to come!”[VAR 0114(000A)]
Do you have some of those balls you use?\nIf not, you’d better get ahold of some!\c\nWhen almighty Sinnoh tells you to catch it,\nyou’d better listen![VAR 0114(000A)]
Come on! Now’s the time! Use the Red Chain![VAR 0114(000A)]
W-wait... What...what is this?[VAR 0114(000B)]
There’s a voice in my head—no, in my...heart?\nIt’s speaking to me![VAR 0114(000B)]
“You hold...the Red Chain... Try to catch\nme, then!”[VAR 0114(000B)]
Whoa, Irida! Do you hear what you’re saying?\nCatch you?![VAR 0114(000A)]
A-almighty Sinnoh? I think almighty Sinnoh may\nbe speaking to me![VAR 0114(000B)]
It’s telling me...\c\n“You hold...the Red Chain... Try to catch\nme, then! For the fight to come!”[VAR 0114(000B)]
Do you not have any of the balls you use to\ncatch Pokémon, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nIf almighty Sinnoh says you should catch it,\nyou may need those balls for this fight...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Take these.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Almighty Sinnoh is bound to be far stronger than\nany Pokémon noble.\c\nBut it is still a Pokémon! You must catch it![VAR 0114(0009)]
Well, almighty Sinnoh says we’re to catch it...\nHave you brought Poké Balls, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000B)]
So almighty Sinnoh wants us to catch it? You’ve\ngot some Poké Balls, right?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Defeating it won’t settle this... You’ve got to\ncatch it![VAR 0114(000B)]
I guess this won’t end until you catch it! Go get\nit, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000A)]
[~ 173]
Get outta there! Regroup![VAR 0114(0009)]
Remember what I said—or what that Pokémon\nsaid to me?\c\nIt was saying, “try to catch me!”[VAR 0114(000A)]
Don’t forget what that Pokémon said when it\nspoke to me!\c\nIt said, “try to catch me!”[VAR 0114(000B)]
Take these.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Hrrrm. If you have the strength to defeat it,\nsurely you will be able to catch it as well.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Hrrrm. You have no Poké Balls! How do you\nexpect to catch the Pokémon without the\r\nproper tools?\c\nYou must have Poké Balls on hand if you wish to\nchallenge the Pokémon![VAR 0114(0009)]
It’s time to catch the Pokémon. Are you ready to\nbattle it?
I’m ready
Not yet
You know I have the highest faith in your abilities,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]. You’ll do splendidly out there![VAR 0114(0005)]
Make sure you catch it, not defeat it. Just like\nwith the Pokémon from your entry trial![VAR 0114(0006)]
Remember what I told you way back during your\nentry trial!\c\nYou’re not meant to defeat it—you’re meant to\ncatch it![VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 186]
GUGYUGUBAH!
GAGYAGYAAH!
[~ 189]
[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe caught it![VAR 0114(000A)]

It’s all because she had me to show her the ropes\nwhen she first got here![VAR 0114(0006)]
Looks like I taught him well.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Wait—it’s happening again! I can hear almighty\nSinnoh... No! No, it’s called Dialga! Mighty\r\nDialga’s speaking to me in my mind![VAR 0114(000A)]
“Space-time is torn... Awful power spills forth...\nThe frenzied one...comes to fight! Now, human!\r\nFight it with me!”[VAR 0114(000A)]
Ah! I can hear almighty Sinnoh—no! It’s...it’s\ncalled Palkia! Mighty Palkia is speaking to me\r\nin my mind![VAR 0114(000B)]
“Space-time grows chaotic... The power fails...\nThe frenzied one... It comes now to fight!\r\nThat is why I am here!”[VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 201]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You’re telling me there’s ANOTHER one?!\c\nBut the Red Chain’s smashed to bits! No way\neven [VAR 0100(0000)] could tackle\r\nanother\r\nPokémon\r\nas\r\nstrong\r\nas\r\nthat\r\nlast\r\none now![VAR 0114(0009)]

Whatta ya waitin’ for?! I’m tellin’ ya, we gotta\nget gone![VAR 0114(0009)]

Such dreadful power... It’s certainly beyond our\ncurrent capabilities to survey such a creature.\c\nI’m amazed you even managed to stay on your\nfeet before it, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nAnd did you notice the energy pouring out of\nthe rift?\c\nIt seems likely that a buildup of this same energy\nwas what caused the strange lightning that threw\r\nthe noble Pokémon into their frenzied states...[VAR 0114(0005)]
I can’t believe there really were TWO almighty\nSinnoh, after all...\c\nGuess that means neither of our clans was really\nwrong, huh?[VAR 0114(000A)]
So our two clans truly were following different\nalmighty Sinnoh, but both were real... What a\r\nshocking turn of events...\c\nTo say nothing of the shock of hearing the\ncommander speak so differently![VAR 0114(000B)]
I must apologize, from the bottom of my heart...[VAR 0114(0009)]
To the both of you, as fellow leaders...[VAR 0114(0009)]
You saw the truth that I could not. You never\nabandoned your trust in [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0009)]
And to you, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0009)]
I acted on ill-considered presumptions and\ndrove you from the Galaxy Expedition Team,\r\nforcing you to face great hardship alone...[VAR 0114(0009)]
And despite all that, you still strove to save all\nof Hisui![VAR 0114(0009)]
Well, it’s not like we could just sit back and\nignore the space-time rift.[VAR 0114(000A)]
And we understood, Commander, that you had\nreasons to act as you did.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Commander, might I suggest we return to the\nmatter at hand? We’ve left things in quite a state\r\nup at the temple.[VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s the stuff, Mr. Professor! You’d rather face\nwhat’s in front of us than dwell on the past, huh?\r\nJust what I’d expect from a real scientist![VAR 0114(000A)]
A dependable attitude indeed.\c\nYes, let us move on. No need to speak any\nfurther about my rash actions. Not to mention\r\nmy loss of composure...[VAR 0114(0009)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]It seems that having [VAR 0100(0000)]\nabout\r\nhas\r\nbeen\r\na good\r\ninfluence\r\non all.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Yeah—thank goodness you were here, huh?\nWe’d have had no chance getting through this\r\ndisaster without you![VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]That’s only natural. [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)] is\nstrong\r\nenough\r\nto\r\ndefeat\r\neven\r\nthis\r\nnew\r\nopponent\r\nsingle-handedly![VAR 0114(000B)]
We’re still not through it! How is [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she to keep\nfighting? The Red Chain has shattered![VAR 0114(000B)]
Whoa, whoa! Slow down! Did you forget that the\nRed Chain broke?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Relax. I’ve got a plan...thanks to what mighty\nDialga told me![VAR 0114(000A)]
We’ll be all right—armed with the knowledge\nmighty Palkia imparted to me![VAR 0114(000B)]
“Dialga”? The Pokémon that spoke to you?[VAR 0114(000B)]
“Palkia”? The Pokémon that talked to you?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Yeah—and along with its name, it also told me\nwhat we need.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Yes! It told me its name—but that’s not all.\nIt also told me this...[VAR 0114(000B)]
“The stone of creation’s beginning.\c\n“The chain of red.\c\n“The vessel of humankind’s invention.\c\n“Unite these three, and calm the chaos now\npervading space.”[VAR 0114(000A)]
“The stone of creation’s beginning.\c\n“The chain of red.\c\n“The vessel of humankind’s invention.\c\n“Unite these three, and calm the chaos now\ndisturbing the flow of time.”[VAR 0114(000B)]
And finally, mighty Dialga said it wants to go with\nus back to the temple.[VAR 0114(000A)]
And then, mighty Palkia must go with us back to\nthe temple, it said.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Well, the Red Chain we have, at least!\nThe pieces, anyway. I did collect them.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Well, that “chain of red” is in pieces now, but\nif little bits will do, I gathered those.[VAR 0114(000A)]
And “the vessel of humankind’s invention”...\nI daresay that might refer to a Poké Ball.[VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s got to be it! But what about that “stone of\ncreation’s beginning” part?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Lian might have some idea.\c\nHe’s knowledgeable about stones and minerals.\nHe even goes digging for ore sometimes.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Is that so? Then Warden Lian will be a fine\nresource to consult.\c\nAnd what are your thoughts, Professor Laventon?\nDo you have any idea what this stone could be?[VAR 0114(0009)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh! Upon my word, perhaps I do!\c\n[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], my [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl! Could you\nlend me\r\nthose\r\nplates\r\nyou\r\nreceived\r\nfrom\r\nWyrdeer\r\nand\r\nthe others?\c\nThe ones that Volo said had messages engraved\nupon them?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Aha! Just as I remembered. Here on the back of\nthe Earth Plate, it says...\c\n“When the universe was created, its shards\nbecame this Plate.” I think this may be a hint to\r\nwhat we need![VAR 0114(0005)]
How do you mean?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Don’t you see? We must search for stone—or\nrather ore, I suppose—that shares the same\r\nmaterial properties as these plates!\c\nIn fact, I believe that young Lian might know just\nwhere to find such a thing, as he said he’d been\r\ninvestigating it at Volo’s urging.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Now that you mention it, that Volo fellow’s come\naround the Diamond settlement asking about\r\nthose plates before, too.[VAR 0114(000A)]
This seems like a lead worth following![VAR 0114(000B)]
It’s decided, then! Thus begins our search for the\n“stone of creation’s beginning.”\c\nAlthough the name is rather a mouthful, wouldn’t\nyou say? I propose we call it...“Origin Ore”![VAR 0114(0005)]
Irida. May we ask for your clan’s aid once more?[VAR 0114(0009)]
Of course! I’ll call Lian to the Summit Camp\nat once.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 44]
I waited as long as anyone could reasonably\nexpect, but my invitation just never came.\c\nSo I decided to honor you all with an unsolicited\nvisit. Be glad and rejoice![VAR 0114(0016)]
Now, Adaman. I see all these other louts have\ntheir little tasks to be getting on with...\c\nBut what of the great Melli? Where’s my role in\nall this?[VAR 0114(0016)]
I’m your leader, Melli. Show a shred of respect,\nwould you?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Fine! Whatever! Just hurry up and give me a job,\ngreat Leader Adaman! And make it a good one![VAR 0114(0016)]
You want a job? Fine. Your job is to support\nthe others!\c\nAll the other wardens are busy looking after their\nnobles and keeping the people of our clans from\r\npanicking. Take a hint![VAR 0114(000A)]
Oh, Adaman. Oh, oh, oh, you silly, foolish boy.\nDon’t you understand anything? Everyone has\r\nwork they are suited to and work they are not.[VAR 0114(0016)]
And, oh! Before I forget. It seems you weren’t\nentirely useless after all, Galaxy Team grunt.\r\nWell done, you.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Take this as a reward for your adorable efforts.\nJust my way of encouraging the little people.\r\nAnd you’re all so little compared to me.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I’ve brought Lian.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Yeesh... That ugly hat suits you as poorly as this\nimportant role does. I don’t like this at all.\r\nI should be the one consulted for my wisdom![VAR 0114(0016)]
Hisui’s ores and stones are her precious resource!\nSince I was the first to realize that fact, it’s only\r\nnatural that I should be the first consulted![VAR 0114(0010)]
If you have a problem with it, perhaps you’d like\nto take it up with Kleavor in battle? With that\r\nbumbling ball of yours?[VAR 0114(0010)]
Ex-CUSE me?! That “bumbling ball” is more than\ncapable of zapping both you and that ugly bug\r\nof yours all the way back to your stupidly\r\noversized tree! Shall we prove it to you now?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Melli, give it a rest and play nice with the Pearl\nClan folks for once, would you? Bigger things are\r\nat stake here![VAR 0114(000A)]
But, Adamaaan!\c\nEveryone back home is all worked up about the\nfact you were spoken to by almighty Sinnoh—\r\nor mighty Dialga or whatever.\c\nThis is the Diamond Clan’s day! Be proud![VAR 0114(0016)]
But, Adamaaan!\c\nEveryone back home is all worked up because\nthe Pearl Clan got to speak to almighty Sinnoh—\r\nor Palkia or whatever.\c\nDo you want them to hog all the glory?![VAR 0114(0016)]
Warden Lian. If you would?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Certainly![VAR 0114(0010)]
Then let us set out at once... We make for the\nPrimeval Grotto![VAR 0114(0010)]
[~ 64]
What a curious cave...\c\nI feel some extraordinary power here—as if the\nworld itself was created in this very place.[VAR 0114(000B)]
What do you think, Lian?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Taking into consideration my knowledge of\nores, my skill at mining, and the strength of\r\nmy Sliggoo’s moves...[VAR 0114(0010)]
I think you’d better leave any extraction work up\nto us, wouldn’t you say?[VAR 0114(0010)]
We’re going to have to ask you to stop\nright there.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh, come on... Who’s there? We don’t have any\ntime to waste with—[VAR 0114(000A)]
Clover?! We haven’t seen you since you walked\nout on the clan! Where’ve you been all this time?![VAR 0114(000A)]
Hmph. I don’t have to tell you nothin’.[VAR 0114(0023)]
Look, you can carry on digging out that treasure\nyou’re after. And then you’ll give it to us.[VAR 0114(0022)]
I don’t know why you even look surprised. It’s not\nas if you were hard to follow.[VAR 0114(0024)]
What we seek may be as precious as treasure,\nbut this isn’t about how valuable it is—we need it\r\nto restore this awful sky to normal![VAR 0114(000B)]
Ugh. That earnest goody-two-shoes act of yours\nis what made me leave the Pearl Clan in the\r\nfirst place![VAR 0114(0024)]
Enough. I don’t care why any of you ran off to\nplay bandit. But I won’t let you get in Lian’s way.\c\nThere are three of you and three of us. Let’s go.\n[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]? You take Charm.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I bring good luck to my sisters wherever I go—\nand ill luck to anyone who crosses our paths.\c\nI’m the eldest, and I’ll be your unlucky Charm.\nEspecially in this: the battle of a lifetime![VAR 0114(0022)]
[~ 79]
Come on, Clover... Why not come back to the\nDiamond Clan?\c\nTimes are changing. We’re changing. And we\ncould really use someone as strong as you are.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Are you joking? I’ve got no interest in living\nback in that place, with all its stupid rules![VAR 0114(0023)]
Look. We’ll let you keep your treasure this time.\nBut you’d better do something about that sky.[VAR 0114(0024)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You are as strong as ever,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]...\r\nMaybe\r\nyou\r\nreally\r\ncan\r\ndo\r\nsomething\r\nabout\r\nthat\r\nmonstrous\r\ncreature\r\nat the\r\ntop of\r\nthe mountain.\c\nBut even if you do, the next time we meet, you\nwon’t escape without a beating! Remember that![VAR 0114(0022)]
Honestly, those three... What did they even come\nhere for?\c\nOh well. I’ll heal up everyone’s Pokémon.[VAR 0114(000A)]
The Coin that I remember never hesitated to\nhelp someone in need, even if she groused as\r\nshe did so.\c\nI suspect they may have been...worried about us.\nPerhaps even wanting to help...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Then they should’ve just said so! What a pain\nthey are, hiding behind all that attitude...[VAR 0114(000A)]
I was able to extract some of that “Origin Ore,”\nor whatever it is you wish to call it. I suppose it\r\nhad better go with you, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0010)]
That was surprisingly easy.[VAR 0114(000A)]
No, you simply fail to recognize my skill.\nYou ought to be praising my hard work! Honestly.[VAR 0114(0010)]
I knew we could count on you, Lian! No wonder\nKleavor recognizes you as a worthy warden![VAR 0114(000B)]
Let’s hurry back to Mr. Professor and show him\nwhat we got.\c\nThat Laventon’s got sound judgment, plus\nknowledge to spare, despite his silly streak![VAR 0114(000A)]
[~ 92]
So this is the “stone of creation’s beginning”...\nThe Origin Ore...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Mhm, yes, one can certainly feel an imposing aura\nemanating from it... Could this be...the feeling of\r\nthe very origin itself?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ve been meaning to ask since you brought that\nup, but...the origin of what exactly?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Of everything, by the sound of it.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Exactly, my girl.\c\nNow then, back we go to Jubilife Village![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 98]
Here you are, Professor Laventon—what remains\nof the Red Chain, broken as it may be.[VAR 0114(000B)]
All right, Mr. Professor. It’s all in pieces now,\nbut this is what’s left of the Red Chain.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Splendid! Even in pieces, I think we’ll find it’s\nstill perfectly fit for purpose.\c\nWe’re jolly lucky you had the foresight to pick up\nall these broken bits back at the temple![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You’re up next, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Time\nfor...uh,\r\nwhatever\r\nwe’re\r\ncalling\r\nthat stone![VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Your turn, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nNext\r\ncomes\r\nthe\r\nstone of\r\ncreation’s beginning.[VAR 0114(0007)]
You handed over the Origin Ore.
The fragments of the Red Chain, collected at\ngreat personal risk by the Pearl Clan...\c\nThen the stone of creation’s beginning, which we\nfirst learned of thanks to the Diamond Clan...\c\nAnd now it is time for the Galaxy Team to play\nits part and turn these items into a proper vessel.[VAR 0114(0005)]
The fragments of the Red Chain, collected at\ngreat personal risk by the Diamond Clan...\c\nThen the stone of creation’s beginning, which we\nonly learned of thanks to the Pearl Clan...\c\nAnd now it is time for the Galaxy Team to play\nits part and turn these items into a proper vessel.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Rei, my boy. You are one of our team’s greatest\ncraftspeople. Could I ask you to do the honors?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Akari, my girl. You are one of our team’s greatest\ncraftspeople. Could I ask you to do the honors?[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Heh. Just wait, [VAR 0100(0000)]! You’ll\nfinally\r\nsee\r\nwhat\r\nI’m\r\ntruly\r\ncapable of![VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]This is my true battlefield,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nEven\r\nif it\r\nmay\r\nbe\r\nsafe indoors.[VAR 0114(0007)]
This may take us some time. Perhaps the rest of\nyou had best wait outside while we work.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 112]
Come on, Mr. Professor... Wish they’d hurry it up\nin there...[VAR 0114(000A)]
I’m starting to suspect all your prattling about the\nvalue of time is a cover for your own impatience.[VAR 0114(000B)]
If sitting back and waiting actually solved things,\nI’d sit forever—because that’d be using time well,\r\nunlike this.[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]We’ve done it, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nIt’s complete![VAR 0114(0005)]
I dub it...the Origin Ball!\c\nIf the message conveyed to our good clan leader\ncan be believed, then this should allow you to\r\ncatch the Pokémon that has appeared at the\r\nTemple of Sinnoh![VAR 0114(0005)]
These Poké Balls of yours are full of wonders.\c\nTo think the fate of all Hisui could rest in\nsomething so tiny...[VAR 0114(000B)]
It’s interesting how catching a Pokémon in\none of these things brings the two of you\r\ncloser together.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Whoa! Hold on—it’s that voice. I hear it in my\nhead again...[VAR 0114(000A)]
You mean Dialga?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Yeah...\c\nSeems like mighty Dialga’s willing to lend its\nstrength to this fight. That’s what it’s telling me.[VAR 0114(000A)]
That’s certainly excellent news!\c\nThe Diamond Clan’s almighty Sinnoh—or perhaps\nI should say Dialga—is fearsomely powerful.[VAR 0114(000B)]
W-wait, please! I hear something... That voice is\nspeaking in my mind again.[VAR 0114(000B)]
You mean Palkia?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Yes... It appears that mighty Palkia is willing to\nlend its own strength to us in this battle.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Now that’s what I like to hear!\c\nThe Pearl Clan’s almighty Sinnoh—well, I guess\nI should just call it Palkia—is one fierce Pokémon![VAR 0114(000A)]
Everything’s ready now, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nTake the Origin Ball, and hurry back to the\nTemple of Sinnoh together with Dialga![VAR 0114(0005)]
Everything’s ready now, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nTake the Origin Ball, and hurry back to the\nTemple of Sinnoh together with Palkia![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 130]
And here you are, lost one. Ready to face your\nfate atop Mount Coronet?\c\nIt seems a vicious battle might await you.[VAR 0114(000D)]
I’ll go where I must
I...I guess I’m going...
Oh, well said.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Come now, child... I know you did not choose this\nburden, and it must weigh mightily on you.\c\nBut you can bear it. You have your friends, your\nallies—and most importantly, your Pokémon.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Now, hearken to my words, young ones.\c\nTime cannot be severed from space, nor space\nfrom time.[VAR 0114(000D)]
The being you will encounter at the Temple of\nSinnoh is Palkia, ruler of all space.\c\nIf it is allowed to run wild, space itself will warp\nand bend here in Hisui, and eventually, the very\r\nworld may be broken.[VAR 0114(000D)]
The being you will encounter at the Temple of\nSinnoh is Dialga, ruler of all time.\c\nIf it is allowed to run wild, time itself will twist\nand bend here in Hisui, and eventually, the very\r\nworld may be broken.[VAR 0114(000D)]
But you have the aid of its counterpart—Dialga,\nthe ruler of time. And therein lies hope.\c\nBalance will be brought to time and space,\nand the world can once again be as it should.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Now, take Dialga at your side and make for the\nTemple of Sinnoh once more![VAR 0114(000D)]
But you have the aid of its counterpart—Palkia,\nthe ruler of space. And therein lies hope.\c\nBalance will be brought to time and space,\nand the world can once again be as it should.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Now, take Palkia at your side and make for the\nTemple of Sinnoh once more![VAR 0114(000D)]
I must say, this is quite the intriguing village...\nPerhaps I’ll have a look around before I go—\r\nsee what your clothier has on offer.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Excuse me? Is this the time for shopping?![VAR 0114(000A)]
Well, I’ll hardly have time for shopping if the\nworld ends, will I, young man?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Fair point.[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]All right, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Once you\nfeel\r\nready,\r\nset out!\c\nWe make for the Temple of Sinnoh once more![VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 148]
Just the [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl I’ve been waiting for![VAR 0114(000C)]
I know you can buy various sundries at the base\ncamp, but I thought it might be helpful to you\r\nif I set up here, closer to the temple.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I want to have front-row seats if there’s a chance\nto see into the world of myth and legend!\c\nI’ll probably be creeping even closer to the\naction once the battle actually begins.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Oh, but you won’t have to worry about me!\nI’m perfectly capable of taking care of myself.[VAR 0114(000C)]
And besides, I know all too well the strength of\nyou and your Pokémon. I’ve got no doubt you’ll\r\nhave this whole thing tied up in a neat bow\r\nbefore I could possibly be in any danger![VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 154]
For so long, I’d thought that I had to eliminate\nany outside element that might threaten the\r\npeople of Jubilife Village.\c\nWhether that meant banishing you or seeking\nto destroy the Pokémon of the temple, I felt it\r\nwas my only path.\c\nBut you’ve shown me that I was wrong to think\nin such a way.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Are you ready for this challenge, recruit?[VAR 0114(0009)]
I’m ready to fight
I need to get ready...
Hrrrm. It’s, ah, difficult to find the appropriate\nway to say this...but...\c\nYou seem to know just when and where to best\ncombine the strengths of humankind\r\nand Pokémonkind.\c\nBring a Pokémon that is willing to aid you. You\ncaught the perfect one at the Temple of Sinnoh,\r\ndid you not?[VAR 0114(0009)]
You have Dialga with you!\c\nThat such a powerful Pokémon has chosen to ally\nitself with you must mean something.[VAR 0114(0009)]
You have Palkia with you!\c\nThat such a powerful Pokémon has chosen to ally\nitself with you must mean something.[VAR 0114(0009)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]—let’s meet tomorrow\ntogether.[VAR 0114(000A)]
What is that supposed to mean?[VAR 0114(000B)]
It’s a saying we’ve got in the Diamond Clan.\nIt means you hope you’ll both stay safe.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Hmm. Perhaps it’s worth listening to what the\nDiamond Clan has to say sometimes as well.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]. In all of vast\nspace,\r\nyour\r\nplace\r\nhas\r\nfound you.[VAR 0114(000B)]
What in the world does that mean?[VAR 0114(000A)]
It’s a Pearl Clan saying.\c\nIt reminds us that occasions we must rise to are\nalso stages where we may prove ourselves—\r\nwhere we might shine our brightest.[VAR 0114(000B)]
So basically, you’re saying not to feel nervous?\c\nI’m starting to see the appeal of how you Pearl\nClan people think. In some situations, anyway.[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]We will support you in whatever way we can,\nthough I doubt you’ll need it.\c\n[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]... Protect Hisui and\nher\r\npeople!\r\nProtect\r\ntime\r\nand\r\nspace\r\nfor\r\nher Pokémon![VAR 0114(0009)]
[~ 171]
[~ 172]
[~ 173]
[~ 174]
[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe...[VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she caught it... [VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe really did it, didn’t [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she?[VAR 0114(000B)]
My eyes aren’t lying...right? [VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe actually went\nand caught it?[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Yes, oh, good show! What a catch! You contained\nthat fearsome thing in the Origin Ball!\c\nAbsolutely astounding as ever,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Thank Sinnoh...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Finally...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Just what I’d expect of my protégé.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Formidable as usual, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0007)]
Mmph... Y-yes.\n*sniff*[VAR 0114(0009)]
So even the commander sheds a tear now and\nthen. Never thought I’d see the day.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Yes, what a sight to have witnessed![VAR 0114(000B)]
Hrrrmph![VAR 0114(0009)]
Ouch! What gives, Commander? Not sure I\ndeserved a sumo throw...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Hrrrm... Well, at least it seems this is no dream![VAR 0114(0009)]
Hrrrm![VAR 0114(0009)]
Listen up, all of you![VAR 0114(0009)]
We faced a calamity unlike any we have known—\nbut we were able to overcome it by working\r\nas one!\c\nThis calls for a celebration—a festival for us all![VAR 0114(0009)]
Gather your clans! This will be the greatest\ncelebration Hisui has ever seen![VAR 0114(0009)]
Celebrate...with the Diamond Clan?[VAR 0114(000B)]
The two clans together, huh...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Well...since it turns out we were both following a\ntrue almighty Sinnoh of our own...\c\nI guess the times when we’d fight over whose was\nwrong or right are ancient history now![VAR 0114(000A)]
I’m sure our ancestors would be shocked to see\nus agree...\c\nBut this may well be the best path toward\nprotecting the space we all share![VAR 0114(000B)]
Let us celebrate! For today dawns a new day\nfor all those who live in the Hisui region![VAR 0114(0009)]

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Morning, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
So the space-time rift is gone... Think this means\nwe can finally close the book on this whole mess?\c\nWell, in any case, there’s one book we can’t\nclose yet: the Pokédex! Time to get back to our\r\nofficial Survey Corps duty of completing it![VAR 0114(0006)]
We’re going to meet in the Survey Corps office\nto discuss how we’ll tackle the work that’s left.[VAR 0114(0006)]
See you there, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
Good morning, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0007)]
It looks like the space-time rift has vanished...\nThe sky’s gone back to normal again.\c\nWhich I suppose means we’d better get back to\nour original mission: completing the Pokédex.[VAR 0114(0007)]
We’re going to meet in the Survey Corps office\nto discuss our next steps.[VAR 0114(0007)]
See you there soon, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 8]
So. I trust you enjoyed yourself at the festival.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Sure did!
I’m exhausted
Indeed.[VAR 0114(0008)]
That only seems natural, given the crowd.[VAR 0114(0008)]
I believe last night was the first time I’ve caught\na glimpse of you making merry, Captain![VAR 0114(0005)]
I believe you must be imagining things.\c\nNow, Professor Laventon, to business. What is\nthe current state of progress on the Pokédex?[VAR 0114(0008)]
I daresay we’ve made quite significant progress,\nall in all.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Though we could afford to put a little more\neffort into our research tasks...[VAR 0114(0005)]
And of course it is hard to know how far to go\nin pursuit of some reports. Certain Pokémon\r\nhave only been mentioned in Hisui’s legends,\r\nafter all. Who knows if they are even real![VAR 0114(0005)]
Yeah, we’re still relatively new to these parts.\nHow are we to know what’s true and what’s not?[VAR 0114(0006)]
With how little we know about Hisui’s history and\nlegends, it seems a tall order for us to tackle...[VAR 0114(0007)]
Pardon! Couldn’t help but overhear![VAR 0114(0004)]
If it’s Hisuian history and legends you want, then\nI’m your man![VAR 0114(000C)]
Why, I’ve spent plenty of time studying such\nthings instead of— Ahem. I mean while also\r\ntirelessly doing my work for the Ginkgo Guild.\c\nAnd I’ve visited many of the ruins and whatnot\nhere in the Hisui region already!\c\nI imagine I could teach you a thing or two about\nany Pokémon of legend in these parts![VAR 0114(000C)]
Oho! Music to my ears, my good fellow.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Listen well, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nYou are to learn all you can from the merchant\nVolo and work together as needed. For the sake\r\nof the Pokédex.[VAR 0114(0008)]
We, meanwhile, will also continue to gather\nintelligence on Pokémon by other means.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Understood! I’ll set up at the Heights Camp, then.\n[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], I’ll be expecting you![VAR 0114(000C)]
Besides, I’ve something I’d like to discuss with\nyou too, so I hope you won’t keep me waiting![VAR 0114(000C)]
If you’d like my advice, it is only this: stay true\nto your own beliefs, no matter what others say.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Oooh, I am giddy at the thought of discovering\nsome Pokémon that may have been around\r\nsince the days of legend and myth![VAR 0114(0005)]
Guess I’ll put my head down and get to crafting.\nCan’t do our surveys without our tools![VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m trying to help the professor categorize\ndifferent Pokémon’s habitats...\r\nbut there are just so many of them![VAR 0114(0007)]
Hrrrm... I suppose there is no end to the study\nof Pokémon, even if the Pokédex is complete.[VAR 0114(0009)]
[~ 34]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! There you are![VAR 0114(000C)]
Have a look here, if you will. A good, long, close\nlook, please![VAR 0114(000C)]
See these patterns modeled after Pokémon?\nI’ve come to think that they might be letters—\r\nrather like hieroglyphs, if you will.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’ve inspected ruins across the region and have\nconcluded that they all seem to tell the same tale.[VAR 0114(000C)]
The tale of a brave soul who, together with the\nPokémon at his side, went on a journey to search\r\nfor the fragments of an all-encompassing deity.[VAR 0114(000C)]
A deity?
All-encompassing?
Yes. An all-encompassing deity—the creator of\nthis very universe. And its name is...[VAR 0114(000C)]
Arceus.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Perhaps you’ve already heard this name?[VAR 0114(000C)]
It does sound familiar
Doesn’t ring a bell
Of course! What else could I have expected from\nthe hero who saved the Hisui region![VAR 0114(000C)]
But that device you have—I was able to get a\ngood look at it as we were visiting the lakes.\r\nYou say it’s called an Arc Phone, correct?\c\nI could swear that it has some sort of tie\nto Arceus...[VAR 0114(000C)]
But now, let us discuss the fragments.[VAR 0114(000C)]
They must surely be the plates!\c\nYes, the very plates you collected as you went\nabout quelling all the frenzied nobles.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Haven’t you noticed that they all have words\ncarved on their backs? Go on—give them a read.[VAR 0114(000C)]
You read the text engraved on the back of the\nfirst plate you obtained...
“The Original One breathed alone before the\nuniverse came.”
This “Original One” is none other than the\nPokémon known as Arceus.[VAR 0114(000C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]So, what do you say, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nI think\r\nwe\r\nshould\r\ntry\r\nto\r\ngather\r\nall\r\nthe plates![VAR 0114(000C)]
And I’ve got just the idea where to start our\nsearch. Join me in the heart of Grueling Grove![VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 57]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Now, [VAR 0100(0000)],\naccording\r\nto\r\nmy\r\nown investigations...[VAR 0114(000C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Wha—? An alpha Vespiquen?! Terribly sorry,\n[VAR 0100(0000)], but...do you\r\nthink\r\nyou\r\ncould\r\nhandle it?[VAR 0114(000C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Come now, [VAR 0100(0000)]! You’re\nstronger\r\nthan\r\nany\r\nother\r\nin Hisui!\c\nPlease, take care of that Vespiquen![VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 61]
You obtained the Stone Plate!
Why did that alpha Pokémon have the plate we\nwere looking for? Maybe it just happened to find\r\nthe plate lying around...[VAR 0114(000C)]
In any case, that’s the only other plate that I had\nany information about, so...that’s that!\c\nAnd yet nothing seems to be happening. Which\nmakes me suspect there must still be more plates\r\nleft out there for us to find.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Not to worry though! I know the perfect person\nto ask—she’s bound to know all about the plates![VAR 0114(000C)]
Mistress Cogita!
“She”?
The one and only Mistress Cogita, yes.\c\nYou haven’t had the chance to properly thank her\nfor her help in obtaining the Red Chain, am I\r\nright? All the more reason to pay her a visit.\c\nSo, onward to the Ancient Retreat![VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 69]
Oh, lost one... It’s miraculous what you’ve done![VAR 0114(000D)]
It seems the Red Chain served its purpose well.[VAR 0114(000D)]
And you carried out your duty, as you were bid.[VAR 0114(000D)]
But what brings you here? Have you yet need\nof me?[VAR 0114(000D)]
It’s about Arceus
It’s about the plates
Ah, yes. A tale whose origins lie a millennium or\ntwo ago...\c\nThose were the days of the ancient Sinnoh\npeople, from whom I am descended across\r\nmany generations.\c\nThese forbears of mine worshiped Arceus\nas the Pokémon that created the Hisui region.\c\nAnd I have heard of certain fragments—plates, as\nthey are called—that were given to the ancestors\r\nof Pokémon such as Kleavor and Wyrdeer.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Is that all? I thought that surely you could tell us\nmore about Arceus and the plates...[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m afraid I’ve nothing new to tell you.\c\nWhy, the Diamond and Pearl Clans would never\nhave confused Dialga and Palkia with the creator,\r\nArceus, had anything concrete been passed down.[VAR 0114(000D)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]If only we had more to go on. The answers to\nthese mysteries may even shed light on why\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nhere\r\nfell\r\nfrom\r\nthe sky.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Aha. I see what you intend. Very well—I’ll help as\nbest as I can.[VAR 0114(000D)]
There are still other tremendous Pokémon in\nHisui—other mysteries to be solved.\c\nWhether they are connected to Arceus, I cannot\nsay for certain. But in searching them out,\r\nperhaps you’ll stumble upon the path you seek.\c\nLet me think...\c\nThere are the Pokémon of the lakes, of course.\nAnd the temple giant.\c\nThe crescent moon, the volcano... And perhaps\nyou might even return to the very beginning...[VAR 0114(000D)]
Now, then... What would you hear of?[VAR 0114(000D)]
The three lake Pokémon
The temple giant
The crescent moon
The volcano
The beginning
Never mind
Ah, yes. Them, you already know. Go give them\nyour thanks for the Red Chain—and show them\r\nhow strong you’ve become.[VAR 0114(000D)]
The secret that lurks in Snowpoint Temple...\nTo find it, you must open the door that is sealed.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Yes, the moon... You must go where you may\nmeet the moon’s gaze unobstructed. Does that\r\nclue illuminate your path?\c\nWell...make for the Coronet Highlands, for now.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Well, where could that be but Firespit Island![VAR 0114(000D)]
Indeed—a beginning for you, certainly... Where\nwas it you first fell to earth here?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Done with your questions, are you?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Very well, lost one. The rest depends on you and\nyour efforts.[VAR 0114(000D)]
It appears that the opening of the space-time rift\ncompelled Pokémon that might otherwise have\r\nstayed hidden to come out and see what has\r\nbefallen the world.\c\nI hope you succeed—for your own sake and for\nthat of the Pokédex you labor on.[VAR 0114(000D)]
I knew we could rely on you, Mistress Cogita!\nThat’s more than enough information to work\r\nwith. Now, let us find those plates![VAR 0114(000C)]
You’d do well to go and look into those five\nleads I’ve told you of, lost one.[VAR 0114(000D)]
[~ 99]
It’s just as I had suspected! Pokémon are the key\nto our search, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000C)]
If we can gather all the plates from them and\ndecipher the messages on the backs of the plates\r\nat last, perhaps we can meet Arceus itself![VAR 0114(000C)]
You should go search for the Pokémon that\nCogita mentioned, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nI have my own avenues of research that I’d like\nto pursue.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Arceus, creator of all Hisui...\c\nI truly can’t wait to see what kind of Pokémon it\nmight be![VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 104]
Kyauun!
[~ 106]
Kyuuun!
[~ 108]
Kyouuuun!
[~ 110]
You obtained the Draco Plate!
You must catch the Pokémon! To battle once more!
There are two more lake Pokémon left to\nbe caught!
There is one more lake Pokémon to be caught!
[~ 115]
That festival attended by everyone in the clans\nand Galaxy Team alike... Oh, it was wonderful!\c\nBeing able to spend time with Iscan in front of\neveryone was like a dream come true.[VAR 0114(0014)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], Lina—ah, I’m\nsorry—Palina\r\nhere\r\nhas\r\nsomething\r\nshe\r\nwants\r\nto\r\ndiscuss\r\nwith you.[VAR 0114(000B)]
That’s right. You should also hear this, Irida.\c\nIt seems something is once again very much\namiss on Firespit Island.[VAR 0114(0014)]
O-oh? Firespit Island?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh dear. You seem reluctant to get involved.[VAR 0114(0014)]
It’s just...very hot there.[VAR 0114(000B)]
My, you speak in such disparaging terms of the\nseat that my lord, Arcanine, calls home! And to\r\nthink, you call yourself our leader, Irida.[VAR 0114(0014)]
N-no, Lina, I didn’t—[VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh, stop with that silly old nickname in front\nof others, won’t you![VAR 0114(0014)]
I’m sorry! I didn’t mean anything by it! It’s just\nan...an old habit...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Well, anyway, you heard her! Please get to\nFirespit Island so we can resolve this!\c\nTruly, please hurry. I might melt out there...[VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 127]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Hello, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Thank you\nfor\r\ncoming\r\nso\r\nfar\r\nout\r\nof\r\nyour way.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Er, Warden Iscan, wasn’t Lina joining us...?[VAR 0114(000B)]
O-oh, yes. About that...um...\c\nIt seems she wanted some time with her lord, so...\nshe’s asked us to check the Lava Dome Sanctum.\r\nWithout her.[VAR 0114(0013)]
What! The nerve of— She knows I can’t stand\nsweltering places like this![VAR 0114(000B)]
I-I’m sure she meant no ill will. The warden of\nthe Lord of the Isles is such a kind, gentle soul...[VAR 0114(0013)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]A-anyway, [VAR 0100(0000)], shall\nwe go?\r\nMight\r\nas\r\nwell\r\nget\r\nthis\r\nover with.[VAR 0114(0013)]
[~ 134]
Gwogobo gwobobobo!
Careful, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 137]
You obtained the Iron Plate!
Phew. At least the heat’s let up a bit.[VAR 0114(000B)]
With both Arcanine and Heatran spewing flames\nabout on a volcanic island, it certainly does get\r\na bit toasty...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Warden Iscan, I have to ask... Do you think there\nwas any need at all for me to be here?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Uh, well, um... Y-yes, of course there was!\c\nAfter all, you are the leader of the Pearl Clan,\nand this trouble cropped up right around the seat\r\nof one of your clan’s nobles so...um...\r\nYes, it was surely best for you to come see to it.\r\nAdmirable of you to look after your clan’s affairs.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Do you really think so? I was wondering if it\nmight not be revenge for all the times I pushed\r\nLina to train her Growlithe harder...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Th-th-that’s...surely not the case!\c\nEven if Warden Palina may have mentioned\nsomething about the need for, um, tough love...[VAR 0114(0013)]
I thought so. To think, she was so patient and\nkind with Growlithe, but when it comes to me...[VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Well, [VAR 0100(0000)], you did great!\nWe’ll, um,\r\njust\r\nhead\r\nback ahead of you, then...[VAR 0114(0013)]
[~ 147]
I don’t suppose a grunt like you would even\nknow, but I guess it behooves me to ask...\r\nDo you know the Pokémon called Cresselia?[VAR 0114(0016)]
I do
I don’t
Well! I figured you’d know. I wouldn’t expect\nany less from someone who managed to defeat\r\nme, even if it was just a fluke![VAR 0114(0016)]
Well, she is an incredibly rare Pokémon. It’s no\nfault of your own that you don’t know about it.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Cresselia is said to be the very embodiment of\nthe crescent moon.\c\nHer feathers are called Lunar Feathers, and\nlegend says that if you hold one as you fall\r\nasleep, you’ll be visited with wondrous dreams.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Well, I call her a nightmare, that pesky Cresselia!\c\nShe’s descended upon Moonview Arena and\ncaused my lord to hide itself away!\c\nI’m so worried about Electrode that I can’t even\nsleep, never mind dream![VAR 0114(0016)]
Think you might be able to catch Cresselia and\nperhaps even claim one of those Lunar Feathers?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Oh, do catch that pesky flying croissant! Do it for\nmy poor Electrode...\c\nThough I suppose Cresselia can’t be all bad, if\nshe at least recognizes the perfection of the arena\r\nlooked after with loving care by the great Melli![VAR 0114(0016)]
Lunaaan...
[~ 158]
You obtained the Dread Plate!
Well, well, this is unexpected. Instead of a Lunar\nFeather, you got some kind of a plate...\r\nI do feel power emanating from it, though.\c\nIn any case, if Cresselia did not gift us with any of\nher feathers, then I suppose she thought we had\r\nno need for them.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Not bad at all, grunt. Though I suppose anyone\nwith enough luck to best the great Melli should\r\nbe able to handle at least that much.\c\nThinking about it, a halfway competent person\nlike you might actually make a decent sparring\r\npartner to help my lord and I grow stronger still![VAR 0114(0016)]
I will go back to the settlement and tell the\nothers about the feathers...that we didn’t get.[VAR 0114(0011)]
[~ 163]
Oh! Wouldn’t have expected to run into you up\nhere, [VAR 0100(0000)]. What are you up to?[VAR 0114(000A)]
You’re here to try and find the secrets lurking in\nSnowpoint Temple, aren’t you?\r\nThat’s what my clairvoyance told me.[VAR 0114(0018)]
You do tend get mixed up in all kinds of strange\ngoings-on, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000A)]
This door here—well, they say behind it sleeps\na Pokémon so great it could tow around the\r\nentirety of the continents that lie to the south.[VAR 0114(000A)]
No matter what we do, this door just won’t seem\nto open...[VAR 0114(0018)]
[~ 169]
The Stone Plate and Icicle Plate you carry seem\nto be reacting to the door...\c\nBut the door remains closed tight.
The Stone Plate, Iron Plate, and Icicle Plate\nyou’re carrying are reacting to the door!
[~ 172]
Wh-what in time is that thing?! It’s colossal![VAR 0114(000A)]
It sure seems to be a Pokémon, but let’s see what\nmy clairvoyance has to say...[VAR 0114(0018)]
Yup! Definitely a Pokémon!\c\nMy clairvoyance showed me a vision of it\nin motion![VAR 0114(0018)]
[~ 176]
...Zut zutt!
[~ 178]
You obtained the Blank Plate!
Now that was one solid Pokémon! Like a giant\nborn of the very earth![VAR 0114(000A)]
I guess this is just part of your job with the Survey\nCorps, huh?[VAR 0114(0018)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]What kind of Pokémon is the one you just caught,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]? Hmmm?\r\nI can’t\r\nwait\r\nto see\r\nin the\r\nPokédex\r\nwhen\r\nit’s done![VAR 0114(0018)]
Yeah, I’m pretty curious to read everything\nMr. Professor writes up, too.[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]See you, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nWe should\r\ndo another\r\nchase sometime![VAR 0114(0018)]
[~ 185]
I’ve had a message from Mistress Cogita.\c\nI’m told you’re collecting plates of some sort\nwith the merchant Volo?[VAR 0114(0009)]
Then we must go to Prelude Beach.\nMeet me there.[VAR 0114(0009)]
[~ 188]
Prelude Beach... Indeed a place of beginning.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Now is not the time for words.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Face me in battle![VAR 0114(0009)]
[~ 192]
You’ve grown even stronger since we faced one\nanother on Mount Coronet.\c\nIt’s clear you do not view Pokémon as dangerous\nenemies but rather as trustworthy allies—\r\nallies with whom you can reach great heights.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Perhaps you are a divine being yourself, sent to\nbring us gifts from above...\c\nHere! You should have this.[VAR 0114(0009)]
You received the Fist Plate!
When the very first of our Galaxy Expedition\nTeam—myself, Beni, and the others—set foot\r\non Prelude Beach, we found that plate.[VAR 0114(0009)]
It clearly held some kind of power, and so I’ve\nkept it safe all this time.\c\nI find it fitting that it should now end up with you,\nwho likewise arrived here on this same beach![VAR 0114(0009)]
Perhaps something is guiding us...\c\nIndeed, it must be so. You and I, Adaman, Irida...\nIt’d appear we’re all being guided by the one\r\ncalled almighty Sinnoh.\c\nHrrrm. It might be more appropriate to call this\nregion the Sinnoh region.[VAR 0114(0009)]
I know I’ve no right to say this...\c\nBut we are truly fortunate to have been able to\ncount you among the Survey Corps’ ranks.\c\nIf you had not joined us, we would have fallen on\nMount Coronet. We would have lost our home.\r\nWe would have lost our future.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Now then. Carry on with your survey work!\c\nThe knowledge that you collect about the wild\nPokémon of this region will serve to illuminate\r\nour path forward as we walk into the future![VAR 0114(0009)]
[~ 201]
You’ve gathered the plates related to each of the\nstories Cogita told you about.\c\nYou should head back to Cogita’s retreat!
Based on Cogita’s hints, it seems there might\nbe [VAR 0200(0001)] more plate[VAR 1101(0001,0100)]s left for you to find.
[~ 204]
Here you are again. Have you collected all\nthe plates?[VAR 0114(000D)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Of course! [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]\nis a\r\nfamed\r\nmember\r\nof\r\nthe\r\nSurvey\r\nCorps,\r\nafter all![VAR 0114(000C)]
So, what more can you tell us? We’re so close\nnow! You must know more about the plates![VAR 0114(000C)]
If there’s yet more you want to know...kindly\nbring me wood. Three logs will do.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Wood? So you’re saying wood is somehow tied\nto the plates...?\c\nWell, I suppose that’s what we get to learn next!\nHop to it, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nWhile it shames me to admit it, merchant that I\nam, I’m quite out of wood in my stores just now...[VAR 0114(000C)]
I suppose I should see this search of\nyours through...[VAR 0114(000D)]
Three logs of wood... What kind of secret could\nlie behind Mistress Cogita’s request?![VAR 0114(000C)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! Have you got all the wood?\nThen we must give it to Mistress Cogita! There’s\r\nno time to lose![VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 213]
Have you gathered the three logs I requested,\nlost one?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Here you go
Not yet
Is that so? Then I’ll disregard the feeling that told\nme you’d gathered them.[VAR 0114(000D)]
You handed over three logs of wood.
Oh-ho! Yes, this certainly ought to do.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Now the moment comes at last! The big reveal!\nWhat, pray tell, is the secret behind this wood?![VAR 0114(000C)]
Secret? Your expectations need tempering, I fear.\nThis wood is merely for fashioning myself new\r\ncutting boards.[VAR 0114(000D)]
C-cutting boards? You mean...for cooking?\c\nThe plates we’re after aren’t dinner plates, so this\nis hardly the time for cooking![VAR 0114(000C)]
How you complain for one shirking his own work\nthis very moment.\c\nPoor Ginter of the Ginkgo Guild must have his\nhands full with you.[VAR 0114(000D)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]But honest work earns honest pay. Here you are,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]—a reward for the\r\nwood\r\nyou’ve\r\nbrought me.[VAR 0114(000D)]
You received the Pixie Plate!
THAT’S ONE OF THE PLATES WE WERE\nLOOKING FOR![VAR 0114(000C)]
Ahem. Apologies. That’s indeed one of the\nplates that we’ve been searching for.[VAR 0114(000C)]
What do you mean, a plate? Let me see\nthat again!\c\nHmm. This does rather look like one of the plates\nyou’ve been tracking down.[VAR 0114(000D)]
While the engravings upon it made it less than\naccommodating as a cutting board...\c\nwhatever ingredients crossed it certainly gained\na more pleasant flavor. Perhaps that was the\r\nboard’s power—the plate’s power, rather.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Well, no more needs saying. What do you two\nintend to do now?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Well, we’ve managed to collect quite a lot of\nplates by now...\c\nBut I still don’t know what we’re to do with them,\nexactly. It’s just a hunch, but perhaps we should\r\nhave a look around the Celestica Ruins?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Those ruins contain statues of both Dialga and\nPalkia. They might hold more secrets...[VAR 0114(000C)]
I see. A fine pretext to continue shirking your\nmercantile duties to crawl about in old ruins as\r\nyou so enjoy. On with you, then![VAR 0114(000D)]
I don’t need you to tell me! I’m going![VAR 0114(000C)]
The Celestica Ruins, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nI’ll see you there![VAR 0114(000C)]
Go on, now—to the Celestica Ruins. I’m curious\nmyself what you’ll find there.\c\nWhat can we who live now learn from the remains\nof our ancient myths and legends?[VAR 0114(000D)]
[~ 237]
Have a look at this, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(000C)]
This statue has been kept here, far from the\nstatues of Dialga and Palkia...\r\nBroken and shattered, and yet it remains...[VAR 0114(000C)]
Do you know what it is?[VAR 0114(000C)]
I think so...
Not at all...
Of course you would. You’re the greatest wielder\nof Pokémon this land knows. The one who could\r\nbring low even Dialga and Palkia.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Oh? You’re the greatest wielder of Pokémon this\nland knows. The one who could bring low even\r\nDialga and Palkia. But it seems certain things are\r\nbeyond even your grasp...[VAR 0114(000C)]
This crumbling statue once was the figure of a\nPokémon—one that was equal to both Dialga\r\nand Palkia, yet banished from our world...\c\nThe great Pokémon Giratina![VAR 0114(000C)]
It was banished for its violence, left to dwell\nin a world on the reverse side of our own.\c\nIt is a being that has lain in wait for the chance\nto bare its fangs in defiance and tear down\r\nArceus itself.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Now tell me, if this Giratina desires more than\nanything else to challenge almighty Arceus...\r\nwhere do you think it might appear?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Mount Coronet
The Temple of Sinnoh
Exactly! Where one is closer to the heavens than\nany other place in Hisui!\r\n...And where the space-time rift first opened![VAR 0114(000C)]
Huhuhuh... HAHAHAHAHA![VAR 0114(000C)]
I can feel it... We are getting closer to uncovering\nthe secrets of this world! I daresay the excitement\r\nis loosening my lips more than it should, but...[VAR 0114(000C)]
You see, ever since I was young, whenever I met\nwith something painful or heartbreaking...\c\nI couldn’t help but wonder why life was so unfair.\nWhy I was cursed to live through such things.\c\nOf course, I imagine we all go through something\nlike that.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Eventually, I chose to direct all my energy into\nmy own natural curiosity and ambition.[VAR 0114(000C)]
And what tickled my curiosity more strongly than\nanything were the mysteries to be found in\r\nlegends, in history, in ruins...\c\nYou see, I fancied that by unraveling these\nmysteries, I could find out how the world itself\r\ncame to be—and with that knowledge, maybe\r\neven forge a new, better world![VAR 0114(000C)]
Now, if we can find the realm that exists on the\nreverse side of our world...and meet the creator’s\r\nunwanted child banished therein...\c\nperhaps then we’ll be able to understand the\nnature of almighty Sinnoh itself![VAR 0114(000C)]
Don’t you want to see it with your own eyes?!\nWe must make for the Temple of Sinnoh at\r\nMount Coronet’s peak![VAR 0114(000C)]
Dialga and Palkia both appeared from within\nthe rift that once gaped open there, didn’t they?\c\nIf these plates can call anything at all, it seems\nlikely that is where it would appear![VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 259]
The temple lies in ruins now... Columns cracked\nand broken... Like pillars now turned into spears,\r\nstabbing into the heavens...[VAR 0114(000C)]
Well, I detect a distinct lack of Giratina.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Hmm? Is something bothering you?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Ah, I do beg your pardon. I suppose I must seem\nto be behaving strangely![VAR 0114(000C)]
I daresay you deserve to know what I’m really\nafter by now.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Ever since I became convinced that Arceus really\ndoes exist, there has been one question that\r\nconsumed my thoughts...\c\nHow can I meet such a being myself?[VAR 0114(000C)]
It was in an attempt to answer this question that\nI originally sought out Giratina and had it tear\r\nopen that rift in space and time...\c\nAfter all, Giratina wished to stand against Arceus.\nBut that didn’t do the trick...[VAR 0114(000C)]
So then I had you gather the fragments of the\nall-encompassing deity, just as the murals of\r\nthe ruins directed.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Eighteen plates said to be the fragments of the\nall-encompassing deity...\c\nYou hold in your hands seventeen of them. So,\nyou must be wondering: Where is the last one?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Why, it’s right here![VAR 0114(000C)]
Now hand over the plates you gathered! I will be\nthe one to bring them all together![VAR 0114(000C)]
My desire to meet Arceus cannot be contained\nany longer! I need to know what it is!\r\nI MUST know what it is![VAR 0114(000C)]
If I can meet Arceus myself, then I may also be\nable to subjugate its power... And using that,\r\nI will attempt to create a new, better world![VAR 0114(000C)]
Of course, if I create a brand-new world, then\nthis Hisui region that we currently exist in will\r\nbe undone and returned to nothing.\c\nYou, everyone you know, and all the Pokémon\nliving here will vanish in an instant, as if you’d\r\nnever been.[VAR 0114(000C)]
If you want to keep this world from disappearing,\nthen face me in battle!\c\nNot that you have a choice. Even if you don’t\nwish to battle me, I’m not above using force to\r\ntake those plates from you.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Almighty Arceus above! Behold the glorious\nconclusion to my long effort![VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 276]
Why? How?![VAR 0114(000C)]
I’ve devoted myself to Arceus beyond any other!\nI worshiped it as the creator of our entire world!\r\nI bent all of my passion and interest to its study!\c\nAll the time I’ve spent poring over the legends...\nEverything that I’ve done—![VAR 0114(000C)]
You outsider! It’s almost as if you were spat out\nof the space-time rift just to get in my way![VAR 0114(000C)]
No...no, this isn’t finished yet![VAR 0114(000C)]
Can’t you feel it? The chill creeping through your\nveins—the eldritch presence icing your heart?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Bishaan!
[~ 283]
Bishaaan...
Turning tail and running? From this puny\nHUMAN? Pathetic![VAR 0114(000C)]
I was the one to feed you the power you needed\nso that you could take on Arceus![VAR 0114(000C)]
I was the one who gave you the chance to claw\nopen that space-time rift, driving the deity of\r\nspace and the deity of time mad so that you\r\ncould drag the creator out from hiding![VAR 0114(000C)]
How? How could this happen?! Almighty Arceus,\nif you have any heart within you, then tell me...[VAR 0114(000C)]
The blood of the ancient Sinnoh people flows in\nmy veins, does it not?! What is it, then, that you\r\nfind so lacking in me?![VAR 0114(000C)]
Do you mean to tell me that this world doesn’t\nneed to be remade?[VAR 0114(000C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I can’t live with such questions... I can’t bear not\nsatisfying this ache to know!\c\nAnswer me, then, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nDo you\r\nhave\r\nsome\r\ndream\r\nthat\r\npropels\r\nyou,\r\nas\r\nI’ve had?[VAR 0114(000C)]
I do!
I don’t know.
So you do...\c\nDoubtless that dream of yours would never leave\nroom for the dreams of one like me...[VAR 0114(000C)]
You don’t even know...\c\nThen perhaps the day will come when you will\nsuffer and agonize as I do now...[VAR 0114(000C)]
I am the great wielder of Pokémon. And you...\nYou battle alongside your Pokémon.\c\nIn the end, I was alone... But not you.\c\nYou will fight together with your Pokémon to\nseize whatever dreams you have.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Here. Take it...\c\nTake the plate that started me on this path—\nthe plate I once received from Giratina.\c\nMy journey is over. My story ended when I lost\nto you.[VAR 0114(000C)]
You received the Spooky Plate from Volo!
I suppose now you’ve gathered all of the plates\nsaid to exist in this land of Hisui.[VAR 0114(000C)]
The Celestica Flute transformed...into the\nAzure Flute!
So that’s...that’s it... The Azure Flute. Heh.\nIt comes to you.[VAR 0114(000C)]
So Arceus wishes to meet you... Of all people,\nyou had to be the one...\c\nIs that why you were brought to this world?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Gah! I’ve no desire to watch from the sidelines as\nArceus comes to you!\c\nAnd I absolutely cannot accept a world in which\nyou would ever manage to defeat Arceus...[VAR 0114(000C)]
Someday, I’ll solve every riddle in the legends of\nHisui’s Pokémon.\c\nAnd on that day, I’ll stand before Arceus at last—\nNo, I will CONQUER it!\c\nNo matter how many years, how many decades,\nhow many centuries it takes me![VAR 0114(000C)]

A message appeared on your Arc Phone.
“Seek out all Pokémon.”
A completed Pokédex, at last...\c\nThough in a way, you could almost call this a\n“[VAR 0100(0000)]-dex”![VAR 0114(0005)]
And of course you had your directive, didn’t you?\c\nI recall the message you received when you first\nfell down to this land.[VAR 0114(0005)]
“Seek out all Pokémon”...was it not? It seems\nyou’ve finally achieved that goal![VAR 0114(0005)]
So, where must you go now?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Mount Coronet... The Temple of Sinnoh...[VAR 0114(0005)]
You’ll find nowhere else in all of Hisui closer to\nthe heavens...\c\nYou are practically among the stars up there,\nas if one with the very universe—all creation.[VAR 0114(0005)]
What will happen there, I wonder? My scientific\ncuriosity is positively roiling, but...well, this isn’t\r\nmy tale of adventure—it’s yours.[VAR 0114(0005)]
This is for you and you alone to go and find out![VAR 0114(0005)]
We each have our separate duties—yours is to\ngo to the Temple of Sinnoh, and mine is to give\r\nthis Pokédex a jolly thorough read through![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 11]
Would you like to play the Azure Flute?
You decided to play the Azure Flute.
But nothing happened...
Your Azure Flute is making a sound.\c\nWould you like to play the Azure Flute?
You played the Azure Flute.
A glowing stairway appeared!
[~ 18]
Your Arc Phone is starting to glow!
You were bestowed with mysterious balm...
Dodogyuuun!
[~ 22]
Thou hast done well to seek out all Pokémon.
Unflagging devotion to a goal shalt see\nit through...
So hast thou proven by thine actions.
Much as that ancient hero once did. He and the\nPokémon that walked beside him.
To see such truths proven anew, beyond the\nbounds of time and space, bringeth joy to me.
I am glad that I chose thee to call to this world.
As thou walkest onward upon thine own path...
Upon thee...and upon this creation where thou\nnow dwellest...
I bestow my blessing.
And I bestow upon thee a part of myself.
I would walk this world together with thee.\nShow me how it appeareth in thine eyes.
[~ 34]
You received the Legend Plate from Arceus!

You’re that newcomer who fell from the sky!\nAre you heading outside the village?[VAR 0114(0026)]
Of course you are—the Survey Corps must have\nto get out and about to compile that “Pokédex”\r\nbook they’re working on, right?\c\nWell, on your way, kindly do me a favor: find out\nall about Starly![VAR 0114(0026)]
Pokémon certainly are terrifying creatures...\c\nBut when I see Starly, I feel simply...whole!\nNot that I have the least desire to actually\r\nTOUCH one, mind you.[VAR 0114(0026)]
Please let me see Starly’s entry in that Pokédex\nthe moment you’ve completed it![VAR 0114(0026)]
Oh, have you completed Starly’s entry in your\nPokédex? Hurry—let me read it![VAR 0114(0026)]
Hmm... Wait one moment—male and female\nStarly have different appearances?![VAR 0114(0026)]
Let me see...[VAR 0114(0026)]
So the markings on their foreheads are different\nsizes! Incredible—I had no idea![VAR 0114(0026)]
Thank you for letting me read its Pokédex entry.\c\nNow that I know more about it...I imagine I might\nfinally bring myself to touch a Starly![VAR 0114(0026)]
Please, if you can find it in your heart—catch a\nStarly and bring it to me!\c\nThere’s not a Pokémon in the world so adorable\nas Starly, I tell you.[VAR 0114(0026)]
Will you show me a Starly?[VAR 0114(0026)]
Here’s one
Another time
If you catch a Starly, please show it to me![VAR 0114(0026)]
I never expected one so large!\c\nLook at you, catching an alpha—that’s no\nmean feat![VAR 0114(0026)]
The generously fluffed expanse of its plumage...\nThe smooth curl of the feather on its head...\c\nAnd those big, round eyes... I feel like I could fall\nright into them![VAR 0114(0026)]
Oh, it’s lovely through and through! I adore it\ndown to the last feather![VAR 0114(0026)]
Well, hello there, Starly![VAR 0114(0026)]
The smooth curl of the feather on its head...\nThose lovely, round eyes...[VAR 0114(0026)]
Want to touch it?
Want to pet it?
NOOO![VAR 0114(0026)]
I-I think I’m quite satisfied just looking at it after\nall! Besides, it might let loose a move...\c\nWho outside of the Survey Corps or Security\nCorps could actually do something so frightful\r\nas approach a Pokémon willingly?[VAR 0114(0026)]
All the same, I must thank you for showing me\nthis sweet Starly.[VAR 0114(0026)]
Some people will see a Pokémon and simply flee\non sight, you know.\c\nPerhaps being able to read all about Pokémon in\nthat Pokédex might put them more at ease...[VAR 0114(0026)]

No use! I can’t remember. This’ll keep me up\nall night...[VAR 0114(0027)]
Hey, aren’tcha with the Survey Corps? If you\ncatch a Shinx, could you show it to me?\r\nI’ve gotta see one with my own eyes![VAR 0114(0027)]
Please! I can’t remember for the life of me what\nthose ears look like—it’s drivin’ me up the wall![VAR 0114(0027)]
Got one of those Shinx to show me?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Whoa! I-it’s huge!\c\nI’ve never seen a Shinx that big. Perfect for havin’\na good look at those markings![VAR 0114(0027)]
All righty. Let’s have a peek at these round ears...[VAR 0114(0027)]
That’s it! Its ears have that yellow cross pattern\non them—kinda like a star![VAR 0114(0027)]
Can’t tell you what a relief this is. Felt like I had\na bone stuck in my throat, only the throat’s my\r\nbrain and the bone’s a thought!\c\nThanks for helpin’ me get that bone out![VAR 0114(0027)]

All right. If a Pokémon starts eyeing me, I’ll fling\nan Oran Berry, then run while it’s distracted.\r\nIf I just stick to the plan, I’ll be fine...[VAR 0114(0045)]
Oh! Survey Corps [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl!\c\nI was just headed out to the fieldlands to go\ngather Tumblestones, but I haven’t got as many\r\nOran Berries as I’d like.[VAR 0114(0045)]
Are you familiar with Oran Berries?\c\nThey restore some HP to Pokémon that eat them,\nso as you might imagine, Pokémon tend to be\r\nvery interested in them.[VAR 0114(0045)]
You see where I’m going with this? Throwing\nOran Berries is a great way to distract and avoid\r\nwild Pokémon. They’re indispensable!\c\nWith that in mind...could I trouble you to gather\nfive Oran Berries for me?[VAR 0114(0045)]
I’d feel a lot better having more Oran Berries.\nWould you be able to give me just five of them?[VAR 0114(0045)]
I gratefully accept! Gosh, I can’t believe you\nwent to the trouble of finding these just for me![VAR 0114(0045)]
Happy to help!
Not really, but...
Thank you! Gosh, you’re nice for someone who\nfell out of the sky.[VAR 0114(0045)]
I’m sure you meant to say, “happy to help,” right?\nSure you did, you generous soul![VAR 0114(0045)]
Let’s just tuck these away in my satchel...[VAR 0114(0045)]
I won’t let your kindness go to waste. Wish me\nluck with those Tumblestones![VAR 0114(0045)]

Can Pokémon of the same species really come in\ndifferent sizes?\c\nI know the professor said they do, but I’ll have a\nhard time believing it unless I see different-sized\r\nones lined up side by side.[VAR 0114(0029)]
If there really are Buizel bigger than mine,\nI’d love to see them alongside the one I have,\r\nfor comparison’s sake.[VAR 0114(0029)]
And you’re a natural when it comes to catching\nPokémon, right? I bet you see where I’m going\r\nwith this.[VAR 0114(0029)]
If you catch a Buizel bigger than mine, would you\nlet me have it? I’ll make it worth your while![VAR 0114(0029)]
Have you brought me a bigger Buizel?[VAR 0114(0029)]
[~ 5]
[~ 6]
Good gravy! I never expected you’d bring one\nso quickly.\c\nI’m afraid I’m looking for a bigger one, though.\nOne that’s at least around 2'8" would be great![VAR 0114(0029)]
[~ 8]
[~ 9]
Well, I’ll be! I didn’t think they could get THIS\nmuch bigger!\c\nLook at them side by side—they almost look like\na parent and its child. I wonder if there’s room\r\nfor me in that little family![VAR 0114(0029)]
Thank you!\c\nLook at them side by side—it’s almost like the\nbig one is the little one’s older sibling.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Look how the tip of the little one’s snout points\nup when it looks at us. What a precious\r\nlittle thing![VAR 0114(0029)]
And the big one’s flotation sac—there’s\nsomething reassuring about how large it is,\r\ndon’t you think?[VAR 0114(0029)]
Funny how Pokémon of the same species can\nseem so different depending which one’s bigger!\c\nKeeping an eye on Pokémon’s sizes when you’re\ncatching them might spice up your excursions![VAR 0114(0029)]
Thank you for the favor! I know you Survey Corps\nfolks’ work is no joke, so keep at it.\r\nI’ll be rooting for you![VAR 0114(0029)]

Hey. So, there’s this Pokémon called Wurmple.\nHave you heard of it?[VAR 0114(002A)]
Yeah
Nope
Well, you see, I was having a chat with Professor\nLaventon, and he told me that after a Pokémon\r\ngains a certain amount of experience through\r\nbattling and the like, it will sometimes change its\r\nappearance and become stronger.\c\nHe said it was a phenomenon called Evolution.[VAR 0114(002A)]
And so I decided I want to raise a Wurmple\nmyself and have it evolve.[VAR 0114(002A)]
You’re part of the Survey Corps, aren’t you? If\nyou catch a Wurmple, could you let me have it?[VAR 0114(002A)]
There’ll be a reward in it for you, I promise.\nJust get me a Wurmple if you can![VAR 0114(002A)]
Have you got a Wurmple you could give me?[VAR 0114(002A)]
[~ 8]
[~ 9]
Now that’s an alpha Wurmple!\c\nLook at you, catching an alpha. You must be even\nmore talented than people say.\c\nI haven’t got it in me to raise an alpha, though.\nCould you bring me a regular Wurmple?[VAR 0114(002A)]
[~ 11]
[~ 12]
[~ 13]
You really brought me one! You must be as good\nas the rumors say.[VAR 0114(002A)]
I’d like to name this Wurmple right away.\c\nNow, I’ve been told a Wurmple will evolve into\na Pokémon known as Beautifly, so I should give\r\nit a name with that in mind.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Hmmm, this is a tough decision...[VAR 0114(002A)]
Which of these do you like best: Beauticia,\nBeautifred, or Beaugene?[VAR 0114(002A)]
Beauticia
Beautifred
Beaugene
[VAR BD06(0000)]Yeah, I like [VAR 0102(0001)], too! I guess that’s\ndecided, then![VAR 0114(002A)]
I’ll raise [VAR 0102(0001)] to be a splendiferous\nBeautifly. Wait and see![VAR 0114(002A)]
[~ 23]
[~ 24]
[~ 25]
How goes the surveying? We’re getting along\ngreat here, as you can tell![VAR 0114(002A)]
Wait—what’s happening to [VAR 0102(0001)]?[VAR 0114(002A)]
[VAR 0102(0001)] evolved! Finally—it’s become Silcoon![VAR 0114(002A)]
Just a little longer, and it’ll blossom into\nBeautifly. You can do it, [VAR 0102(0001)]![VAR 0114(002A)]
Casssc!

I don’t believe it...\c\nProfessor Laventon seems to think that li’l\n[VAR 0102(0001)] here is a Cascoon...\c\nBut, errr, hello? It’s CLEARLY a Silcoon.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Caaascoo...
You’re making some kinda Pokédex or something\ntogether with the professor, right?[VAR 0114(002A)]
Then you gotta help me!\c\nPlease go catch a wild Silcoon so I can prove\nit’s the same species as [VAR 0102(0001)] here![VAR 0114(002A)]
Once you’ve caught yourself a Silcoon, please\ncome back here and show it to me![VAR 0114(002A)]
Have you brought a Silcoon to show me?[VAR 0114(002A)]
You bet I have!
I’m working on it...
You’re kidding! You caught an alpha? I see the\nrumors of your catching prowess are no joke!\c\nIt’s kinda hard to compare my li’l buddy with an\nalpha though. Could you catch a regular Silcoon?[VAR 0114(002A)]
... ... ...\n... ... ...[VAR 0114(002A)]
Ha! Just as I thought. They’re exactly the same![VAR 0114(002A)]
Those eyes, though...
They’re different colors!
Hmmm, now that you mention it... I guess they’re\nnot exactly two peas in a pod.\c\nI just never would’ve thought two Pokémon this\nsimilar could actually be different species!\r\nPokémon really are curious creatures, huh?[VAR 0114(002A)]
[~ 14]
Ca...cascooo.
[VAR 0102(0001)], my buddy...\nI didn’t know the first thing about you, did I?\r\nI’m sorry if I hurt your feelings.[VAR 0114(002A)]
You sure you’re still happy to have a goof like me\nfor a partner?[VAR 0114(002A)]
Ca-cass!
[VAR 0102(0001)], you loveable rascal!\c\nYou really are the only partner for me! This\ndynamic duo will stay together forever![VAR 0114(002A)]
Hey, how’s the survey work coming along?\c\nWe’ve been doing great since you helped us out,\nisn’t that right, [VAR 0102(0001)]?[VAR 0114(002A)]
Caaaaaas!
Wha— No way![VAR 0114(002A)]
[VAR 0102(0001)], my buddy! Congratulations!\nYou evolved into a Dustox![VAR 0114(002A)]

Hi. Clarissa of the Security Corps—that’s me!\nThanks so much for taking on my request.\c\nI need you to catch a Zubat and show it to me\nso I can take a look at its eyes.[VAR 0114(0033)]
Odd request, I know, but I’ve good reason for it.\nZubat never seem to have trouble flying around\r\nin pitch-darkness.\c\nThat means their night vision must be top-notch!\nIf I could learn how to see in the dark like them,\r\nnight shifts on guard duty would be a breeze.[VAR 0114(0033)]
So I’m counting on your help. Catch a Zubat and\ncome show it to me, would you?[VAR 0114(0033)]
I want to learn how to see in the dark like Zubat.\nPlease catch one and come show it to me![VAR 0114(0033)]
Oh! Do you have a Zubat to show me?[VAR 0114(0033)]
Wow, is this an alpha Zubat?!\c\nI wouldn’t stand a chance if it decided to\nattack me... I’m amazed you’re alive...[VAR 0114(0033)]
[~ 6]
I’ll just take a look at those peepers, if you\nplease, Zubat![VAR 0114(0033)]
Huh...? Where are the eyes on this little guy?\nDon’t tell me...it doesn’t even HAVE eyes?![VAR 0114(0033)]
But...but then that means Zubat flies around while\nbeing completely blind![VAR 0114(0033)]
Hmm... Zubat must have some other kind of\nsecret sense if it doesn’t even need eyes.[VAR 0114(0033)]
*sigh*\nThat’s amazing and all, but it hardly helps me.\c\nWhat am I going to do about my nighttime shifts\non guard duty?[VAR 0114(0033)]
Get a partner Zubat?
Find some help, maybe?
Oh, that’s a good idea! No need for me to go it\nalone, after all. A little help would be great!\c\nThat’s that, then. I’ll get out there and find\na Zubat that can help me as my partner.\r\nThanks for the great advice![VAR 0114(0033)]

Hey, sport. Interest you in some target practice?\c\nAll you’ve got to do is lob some balls and try to\npop some balloons. Easy peasy, fun and breezy.
Even got some fine prizes lined up to give out,\ndepending on how well you do.
If you manage to break 10,000 points, you’ll\nbe in for a real treat—I can tell you that.
If you’re up for a challenge, you just let me know.\nI’m usually to be found in the practice field.
If you ever manage to break 10,000 points,\nyou’ll be in for a real treat. Just you wait and see.
Well done, sport! Since you broke through the\n10,000-point mark, you get the real prize!

Oh, splendid! You came along at a good time.[VAR 0114(002B)]
I’m looking for a pickling stone, you see.\nWould you mind lending me a hand?[VAR 0114(002B)]
It needs to be the right size to fit atop one of my\npickle pots and heavy enough to put a nice, firm\r\npressure on the pickles while they’re fermenting.\c\nHmm... But I suppose it’ll be hard for me to lift\nsuch a heavy thing from the pot... The best thing\r\nwould be for the stone to lift itself up, actually...[VAR 0114(002B)]
Oh! I’ve a rather good idea. There’s a Pokémon\ncalled Geodude that lives on Deertrack Heights—\r\nit would be perfect for the job!\c\nCould you catch one and bring it back for me?\nI’ll head home and wait for you there.[VAR 0114(002B)]
Please catch a Geodude for me! I hear there are\nsome upon Deertrack Heights.[VAR 0114(002B)]
Oh! Are you here to give me a Geodude?[VAR 0114(002B)]
[~ 6]
[~ 7]
My! What a huge Geodude! You people from the\nSurvey Corps are really rather impressive!\c\nThough I’m sad to say this big fellow would likely\nend up squishing my poor pickles... Be a dear\r\nand catch a regular-sized Geodude for me![VAR 0114(002B)]
[~ 9]
[~ 10]
[~ 11]
If you ever have a Geodude you’re happy to\npart with, come speak to me again, will you?[VAR 0114(002B)]
Oh my! Would you look at that!\c\nIt really does look like a rock! And it seems to be\nthe ideal weight, too. Oh, it’s simply perfect![VAR 0114(002B)]
Thank you, young [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]manlady. With this Geodude’s\nhelp, I’ll surely make some scrumptious pickles![VAR 0114(002B)]

Be super brave?
Be wicked smart?
NOPE![VAR 0114(0060)]
...I mean, I guess that’s also important...\nBut you need to have a partner Pokémon!\c\nWith a great partner Pokémon backing you up,\nyou’ll be as strong as 100 people![VAR 0114(0060)]
I really wanna catch a Pokémon of my own\nsomeday, so I’ve been throwing balls to get my\r\naim spot-on.\c\nNow I think I’m ready to practice with real\nPoké Balls![VAR 0114(0060)]
I bet you have loooads of them, since you’re in\nthe Survey Corps and all!\c\nDo you think you could give me just five of your\nPoké Balls? Pleeease?[VAR 0114(0060)]
Just five Poké Balls! Please? Pleeeeeease?\c\nI’ll give you something from my special item\nstash in exchange![VAR 0114(0060)]
Gimme five Poké Balls![VAR 0114(0060)]
Woo-hoo! Now I can catch a partner Pokémon\nof my own![VAR 0114(0060)]
Here’s a reward, just for you—some Grit Dust!\nIt was super hard to collect, so I hope you like it.\c\nIf you wanna know more about what it does, you\ncan ask Captain Zisu! She knows all about it.[VAR 0114(0060)]
Anyway, I’m gonna practice loads with the\nPoké Balls you gave me.\c\nIf you find a Pokémon that’d be a great partner\nfor me, let me know so I can go catch it![VAR 0114(0060)]

Ah, just the person I was waiting for! There’s a\nPokémon I was hoping you could bring me.[VAR 0114(005A)]
I’ve been trying to make a business of offering\nthe groundbreaking experience of having your\r\nphoto taken with Pokémon...\c\nbut no one around here seems to understand the\nappeal. Perhaps they’re all just too afraid of\r\nPokémon to get over their reluctance...[VAR 0114(005A)]
But I happened to accidentally catch a Pokémon\nin this photo, and it gave me a brilliant idea![VAR 0114(005A)]
See how fluffy it is? How adorably soft?\nHow irresistibly, impossibly cuddly?\c\nOnce people see a Pokémon like this in a photo,\nthey’ll all want to have their portraits taken\r\ntogether with it![VAR 0114(005A)]
But I need to get a better shot of it than this one.\nIf you find one, could you bring it here?[VAR 0114(005A)]
What can I help you with?[VAR 0114(005A)]
I want to take a photo
About that request you had...
I think I’ve got the Pokémon you wanted
Can you show me the photo again?
Oh, it’s even fluffier and lovelier than I imagined\nfrom that photo! This is it! This is exactly it![VAR 0114(005A)]
Let’s get a proper shot at once![VAR 0114(005A)]
[~ 12]
I was able to get just the shot I needed, thanks\nto you and that Pokémon of yours.\c\nThis should go a long way toward getting the\nother villagers over their fears and into some\r\nphotos with Pokémon![VAR 0114(005A)]
If you manage to catch that furry, fuzzy, cuddly\nPokémon from the photo, do come show me.[VAR 0114(005A)]
Well, the fluffy tufts of fur do seem similar, but\nthis one has floppy ears... That’s quite different.\c\nI don’t think this is the Pokémon that I caught in\nmy earlier photo. Can you keep looking for me?[VAR 0114(005A)]
That certainly is an attractive specimen worth\ncapturing on film! But I don’t think that’s what\r\nappeared in my photo. Is it really out there?[VAR 0114(005A)]
G-gracious! Its presence is more overwhelming\nthan I would have guessed from the photo!\c\nYou certainly pulled off a feat catching such a\nthing. My word. Simply astounding.[VAR 0114(005A)]

I hear you caught three different species of\nPokémon in your trial. That’s no mean feat!\c\nI have a job that’s perfect for a high achiever\nlike you. See, I need help researching—[VAR 0114(002C)]
Arrgh! It’s those pesky Bidoof again![VAR 0114(002C)]
I look away for ONE second, and the little\nscoundrels waltz right into the village![VAR 0114(002C)]
Ohhh, this is awful... I’m a complete failure as\na member of the Security Corps...\r\nHow can I face Captain Zisu like this?[VAR 0114(002C)]
No, get ahold of yourself, Tsumugi! Just catch the\nBidoof, and everything will be fine.[VAR 0114(002C)]
But still...three Bidoof is a lot. Two more than I\nthink I could handle on my own, in fact...[VAR 0114(002C)]
Oh! I have an idea![VAR 0114(002C)]
[~ 7]
I’ve heard that these particular pests get easily\ndistracted if other Bidoof are nearby and end up\r\nletting their guard down around humans!\c\nSo if you bring a Bidoof to draw their attention,\nI can seize that chance to catch the little\r\ntroublemakers! Voilà, the perfect plan![VAR 0114(002C)]
If we combine forces, we’ll get all three caught\nin no time at all![VAR 0114(002C)]
First things first—we need to find where each of\nthose pesky Bidoof waddled off to.\c\nRemember—they should let their guard down as\nlong as you have another Bidoof with you![VAR 0114(002C)]
*chomp chomp*
Caught it! Great going, team![VAR 0114(002C)]
Darn, it got away...[VAR 0114(002C)]
Let’s wait a while, then go search for it again.\c\nJust make sure you have a Bidoof with you, and\nthose pests won’t pay us humans any mind![VAR 0114(002C)]
Nice work! That puts all the little troublemakers\nsafely in our custody.[VAR 0114(002C)]
Now to give ’em the old heave-ho![VAR 0114(002C)]
Hold on![VAR 0114(001F)]
It’d be a shame to just send those Bidoof back\ninto the wild, no? My Construction Corps could\r\nfind a use for ’em.[VAR 0114(001F)]
Huh?! You want to keep them?\c\nBut these naughty nibblers have caused so much\ntrouble for the Construction Corps![VAR 0114(002C)]
They’re just Pokémon being Pokémon.\nHow’re they supposed to know our village is a\r\nstrict no-chewing zone?\c\nShows good taste on their part to come all the\nway here to gnaw on our woodwork, too.[VAR 0114(001F)]
But if they’re gonna stay here, they’ll have to\nhelp with our work![VAR 0114(001F)]
They’ve got the guts to keep trying to get into\nthe village, plus the teeth to gnash through\r\ntrees and rocks—just what our corps needs![VAR 0114(001F)]
How about it, little ones? Meals taste better\nafter a day’s work, y’know![VAR 0114(001F)]
Doooooof!
Just what I wanted to hear![VAR 0114(001F)]
Hmmm... I’m not convinced this lot have it in\nthem to do an honest day’s work...\c\nBut if Sanqua’s watching over them, I’m sure\nit’ll work out all right.[VAR 0114(002C)]

Throw one of your Poké Balls at a Berry tree,\nand your Pokémon will grab the Berries for you!\c\nBe sure the Poké Ball you throw has a Pokémon in\nit, mind! It’d be a shame to waste an empty ball!\c\nIf you hand me three of the Cheri Berries you\nget, I’ll tell you another handy tip.[VAR 0114(0096)]

Ooh! Could you give me three of those Cheri\nBerries you have there?[VAR 0114(0096)]

You can throw a Berry near wild Pokémon to grab\ntheir attention and keep ’em distracted![VAR 0114(0096)]

No, no. Everything’s fine. Whatever you need,\ncome back later, all right?[VAR 0114(001F)]
What’s the matter?
Are you all right?
Hmm. Maybe a Survey Corps type like you could\nfigure out what’s causing this...[VAR 0114(001F)]
Look, when I’m in my quarters trying to sleep at\nnight, it feels... It feels like I’m not alone in there!\c\nSometimes, there’s this kind of crackling sound...[VAR 0114(001F)]
I’ve found burnt Berries a couple times, and\nonce in a while, I hear something clatter...[VAR 0114(001F)]
So, Survey Corps kid, go survey my quarters!\nFigure out what’s happening![VAR 0114(001F)]
Just do it at night, would you? I’ve gotta be at\nwork during the day.[VAR 0114(001F)]
Ready to investigate my place?[VAR 0114(001F)]
I’m ready
Not yet
I swear there’s something in there. Check every\nnook and cranny for me, OK?[VAR 0114(001F)]
Doesn’t seem you’ve solved my mystery yet...\nNeed a break or something?[VAR 0114(001F)]
Yes
Not yet
I know it’s still lurking in there, whatever it is...\nPlease, come back as soon as you can![VAR 0114(001F)]
There’s a faint smell—it seems like Berries had\nbeen present here...
There was a noise from the entryway!
You heard something from beneath the cloth!
*crackle crackle*
You saw sparks fly for a moment. It seems like\nsomething ran by you.
There was a noise from back near the closets!
Survey Corps kid! Are you all right? I heard this\nstrange noise...[VAR 0114(001F)]
Wait a minute. This Pichu—could it be...[VAR 0114(001F)]
It might sound absurd, but...I think this might be a\nPichu I found injured in the forest a while back.[VAR 0114(001F)]
A Berry? For me? What, because I fixed you up?[VAR 0114(001F)]
Chu!
Wait—so the thing haunting my quarters was\njust...a grateful little Pichu?[VAR 0114(001F)]
Guess all that worrying was pointless! To think,\nI was afraid it was some spine-chilling thing.[VAR 0114(001F)]
Regardless, I owe you! Have a token of\nmy gratitude.[VAR 0114(001F)]
The cloth has been pulled to one side, and...\nis that a hair on the hem? A short, black hair?
You can hear the crackling of static electricity\nfrom the cloth-covered box as you approach.
It’s full of neatly folded uniforms.
It’s full of rolled-up architectural plans.\c\nThere’s a sketch of a Magikarp, too. Perhaps it’s\npart of the plans for Galaxy Hall.
There are some weird clothes and a cape inside.
The closet door is open just a crack... Do you\nwant to peek inside?
Take a peek
It contains architectural models.\c\nThere’s a model with a Gyarados sculpture on it.\nPerhaps it’s an earlier design for Galaxy Hall.
The sliding windows are slightly ajar, as if they\nwere recently moved...
There’s a cloth draped neatly over the mirror.
Draw it back
Leave it alone

I was hoping to get some advice on evolving him,\nbut I can’t evolve the little guy if he’s gone.\r\nPlease! Help me find Eevee![VAR 0114(003B)]

Survey Corps kid—would you make me a\nJubilife Muffin?\c\nIf I can watch this Pokémon chow down like\nEevee did, maybe I’ll understand this nagging\r\nfeeling I get when I look at it...[VAR 0114(003B)]
Breah!
Would you mind parting with a Jubilife Muffin?[VAR 0114(003B)]

Look at it chow down! It really is the spitting\nimage of Eevee when it does that.\r\nOr could it somehow be...the real Eevee?[VAR 0114(003B)]

Hey, listen to this! I saw something out in the\nwilds! Oh, it was incredible![VAR 0114(002D)]
Come again?
What was it?
The thing I saw was...a will-o’-the-wisp! A ball of\nbright red fire![VAR 0114(002D)]
When I was walking on Windswept Run the\nother night, it leaped at me like woooOOOooo![VAR 0114(002D)]
At it again with this story, huh?\c\nDon’t listen to her, m[VAR 1100(00FF,0405)]istera’am. My big sis always gets\ncarried away with her fairy tales.[VAR 0114(005F)]
Oh for goodness’ sake, I’m not making it up!\nI saw that will-o’-the-wisp with my own two eyes![VAR 0114(002D)]
Oh yeah? Then why don’t you show it to me?\nHeh. Good luck with that![VAR 0114(005F)]
It’s SO frustrating he won’t believe me...\nI honestly did see one![VAR 0114(002D)]
Say... You’re with the Survey Corps, right?\nAnd I hear you’re quite the prodigy!\r\nI bet you could easily catch a will-o’-the-wisp![VAR 0114(002D)]
Do you think you could catch the one I saw\nand bring it back here?[VAR 0114(002D)]
Last place I saw the will-o’-the-wisp was on\nWindswept Run at nighttime. Please catch it![VAR 0114(002D)]
You should catch the Chimchar so you can show\nit to Paira!
Go back to Paira and show her the Chimchar\nyou caught!
Paira said she saw the will-o’-the-wisp on\nWindswept Run at nighttime...
Have you come to show me the will-o’-the-wisp\nI saw?[VAR 0114(002D)]
Here it is!
Not yet
Come show me once you’ve caught it, OK?\c\nWaka won’t have a choice but to believe me\nwhen he sees the will-o’-the-wisp glowing in the\r\ndark, right before his eyes![VAR 0114(002D)]
Why, this is an alpha Pokémon, isn’t it? That’s\nincredible and all...but a will-o’-the-wisp is what\r\nI’m after, remember? Please catch it for me![VAR 0114(002D)]
A Pokémon? But I’m certain what I saw was a\nwill-o’-the-wisp, you know!\c\nHm? I should look at this Pokémon at night?\nOK... If you say so...[VAR 0114(002D)]
Th-that’s it! That’s the will-o’-the-wisp I saw,\nall right![VAR 0114(002D)]
So it was a Pokémon all along...[VAR 0114(002D)]
In any case, you caught it just like you promised!\nThe Survey Corps really are a talented bunch.[VAR 0114(002D)]
Hang on—a Pokémon?! Seriously?[VAR 0114(002D)]
*sigh*\nWell now I feel like I wasted all that excitement\r\nand surprise I felt when I first saw it. I thought it\r\nwas a real will-o’-the-wisp![VAR 0114(002D)]
But no, you did an amazing job uncovering\nthe truth—and catching the little fireball to boot!\r\nThe Survey Corps really are a talented bunch.[VAR 0114(002D)]
Now I just have to explain the whole thing to\nWaka somehow. Can’t say I’m looking forward\r\nto that...[VAR 0114(002D)]

The mushroom! I-it turned around!\c\nEr, no...no, you’re saying this thing is a Pokémon,\nnot a mushroom.[VAR 0114(002E)]
And yet... Call it a forager’s intuition, but 20 long\nyears of picking tells me something is amiss...\c\nYes, I’m sure of it. This thing that turned to look\nat me just now... It’s definitely a mushroom![VAR 0114(002E)]

You’re here about my Ponyta request, right?\nGlad to have some help at last![VAR 0114(0040)]
Here’s the problem...\c\nA Ponyta like no one’s ever seen before has\nappeared in the Horseshoe Plains.\c\nIt looks so different than the other Ponyta, it’s a\nlittle scary, to be honest![VAR 0114(0040)]
But when I told the professor he got all excited\nabout researching it! So we agreed to have the\r\nPonyta surveyed and see what’s what.[VAR 0114(0040)]
If you’d head to the Horseshoe Plains and catch\nthat strange Ponyta for us, it’d really help us out![VAR 0114(0040)]
The unusual Ponyta ran away! You should return\nto Jubilife Village and try again later.
You caught the unusual Ponyta! Time to report\nback to Yota in the village.
I see you caught that strange Ponyta! You Survey\nCorps folks sure don’t mess around.[VAR 0114(0040)]
You know, a friend of mine from Galar was\nsurprised when he saw the Ponyta herds out in\r\nthe fieldlands. He couldn’t wrap his head around\r\ntheir fiery manes![VAR 0114(0040)]
At the time, I thought it was an odd thing to be\namazed by... But now that I know some Ponyta\r\nhave blue flames, it’s not such a stretch to think\r\nthere might be all sorts of them out there.[VAR 0114(0040)]
And I’m not just talking about Ponyta, mind!\c\nWho knows how many differently colored\nPokémon there are in the world!\c\nI hope the Survey Corps keeps trying its level\nbest to research them all.[VAR 0114(0040)]

So, you’ve accepted my request to look into that\nDrifloon? I can’t tell you what a big help that is![VAR 0114(002F)]

[~ 2]
Let me fill you in. We’d heard reports that a\nDrifloon was playing with one of the village\r\nchildren over on Prelude Beach in the evenings.[VAR 0114(002F)]
This seemed like odd behavior for a Pokémon,\nso all of us in the Security Corps worried its true\r\nintentions were to harm the child in some way.\c\nThankfully all the village children were safe and\naccounted for when we went to check on them,\r\nbut there was one curious thing...\c\nNone of them seemed to know anything about\na Drifloon![VAR 0114(002F)]
But, well, so many people from the village have\nreported seeing the Pokémon—we can’t simply\r\npretend there isn’t an issue here.[VAR 0114(002F)]
Since this calls for some investigation, I thought\nthe Survey Corps would be our best bet!\c\nWe need you to find out the truth behind the\nDrifloon and the child it’s been playing with.[VAR 0114(002F)]
It seems one of the village children plays with a\nDrifloon on Prelude Beach in the evenings.\c\nWe need you to identify the child and find out\nwhat this Drifloon is after.[VAR 0114(002F)]

Errr...

Fwoooooo!
Yaaay! Now I can finally go home!
But hey, um, Drifloon didn’t mean to be bad.\c\nIt always played together with me—it’s real\nfriendly! So...I kept it a secret from everyone.
Oh! My name’s Taki. See you around, Survey\nCorps [VAR 1100(00FF,0302)]bolady![VAR 0114(004D)]

All the same, he was in considerable danger!\c\nWithout your help, goodness knows where\nDrifloon would have taken him by now...[VAR 0114(002F)]

I’d be remiss if I didn’t follow up on this\ntroubling incident.\c\nI’ll urge Captain Zisu to post extra Security Corps\nguards out on Prelude Beach at once![VAR 0114(002F)]

If you manage to burst, say, 17 balloons, well,\nthat’d be an impressive start!
You can find me here any time, so let me know\nwhenever you feel like testing your skill in the\r\nballoon race!

There you are! You’re the one, right?! The one\nthey’ve all been talking about—the Survey Corps\r\nkid that’s been exploring the Crimson Mirelands![VAR 0114(0091)]
My younger sister Wanda is in the Security Corps,\nyou see, and she went to the mirelands, too—\r\nbut she never made it back![VAR 0114(0091)]
You managed to track down that Arezu woman\nin those boggy mirelands, right?\r\nSo could you find my sister Wanda, too?[VAR 0114(0091)]
Anything I can go off of?
What’s she smell like?
You planning on using a Pokémon to find her?\nHmm. Would her favorite kerchief maybe help?[VAR 0114(0091)]
Wh-what?![VAR 0114(0091)]
O-oh, you mean you can search by her scent?\nWell, maybe the kerchief she usually carries\r\ncould be of some use?[VAR 0114(0091)]
Ursaluna picked up Wanda’s scent!
I’m counting on you! Please find Wanda wherever\nin the mirelands she’s ended up![VAR 0114(0091)]
I know it’d be better if I just went myself, but I’m\nan utter disaster when it comes to Pokémon...\c\nSo please! Find Wanda wherever in the mirelands\nshe’s ended up![VAR 0114(0091)]
Return to Galaxy Hall, and report to Zeke!
A-a person! Another real, live human being!\nOh, thank goodness![VAR 0114(0070)]
I was on my way back to the base camp when I\ngot attacked by some wild Pokémon...\c\nI managed to get away from them, but I got\ncompletely lost when I was running, and...um...\r\nPlease! Can you tell me how to get back home?![VAR 0114(0070)]
That way? I see! Thank you so much.[VAR 0114(0070)]
Er, I mean, this way! Right, of course! I knew you\nmeant this direction![VAR 0114(0070)]
I know that there’s a lost and found for items,\nbut I never thought there was one for people...\r\nor that I would end up in it!\c\nBut, goodness, you Survey Corps people really\nare great at finding things![VAR 0114(0070)]
Wanda made it back home safe!\c\nBoy, am I ever glad I asked you... You’re just as\ngood as everyone says you are![VAR 0114(0091)]
Wanda is still new to the Security Corps, you\nunderstand. And she’s a bit flighty at the best\r\nof times, so I can’t help but worry about her.\c\nIf it’s not asking too much, do you think you\ncould continue to keep an eye on her?[VAR 0114(0091)]
Oooh, stop it, Zeeky! You’re embarrassing me!\nI just got unlucky this time—that’s all it was![VAR 0114(0070)]
That’s what you’d have me believe, but ever\nsince we were kids, the instant I took my eyes off\r\nof you, you’d be lost somewhere in the bushes![VAR 0114(0091)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Well, anyway, [VAR 0189(0000)], I do\nappreciate\r\nall\r\nyour\r\nhelp.\r\nSo thank you from me, too![VAR 0114(0070)]

One moment, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Would you come here, please?[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Er, [VAR 0100(0000)]? I think you’ve got\nsomething\r\nstuck\r\nto you...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Was that a Pokémon?![VAR 0114(0005)]
Come to think of it, Volo did mention that there\nwere carvings that resembled writing on the walls\r\nof the Solaceon Ruins...[VAR 0114(0005)]
But supposing that the Pokémon we just saw is a\nspecies with multiple forms, perhaps the carvings\r\nare actually likenesses of this very Pokémon![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m going to add a section specifically for that\nspecies to your Pokédex, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Unown Notes were added to your Pokédex!
What’s this, now? Letter-like markings seem to\nhave appeared in this section I’ve just added...[VAR 0114(0005)]
And was that your Arc Phone I just heard?\nIf your mysterious device is reacting to this\r\nnew species, I wonder what that could mean...[VAR 0114(0005)]

Why, if it isn’t one of the young’uns from the\nSurvey Corps! Good thing you dropped by.\c\nI need some help making friends with this Eevee.\nThink you could lend a hand?[VAR 0114(003B)]
Canala—my granddaughter—brought the little\nguy home with her the other day, and I want us to\r\nbe on good terms.[VAR 0114(003B)]
After thinking long and hard, I decided the best\nway to win Eevee over is the old fashioned way...\r\nThrough tasty treats![VAR 0114(003B)]
So I’ll be whipping up a special snack from my\nhometown. Some of the ingredients for it don’t\r\ngrow here in Hisui, but I found a few local Berries\r\nand things that’ll make good enough substitutes.[VAR 0114(003B)]
Three stalks of Hearty Grains, two Hopo Berries,\nand one Razz Berry is what I need. I’m counting\r\non you![VAR 0114(003B)]
[~ 5]
[~ 6]
[~ 7]
I see you’ve found all the ingredients I asked for!\c\nThree stalks of Hearty Grains, two Hopo Berries,\nand one Razz Berry... Yes, they’re all here!\r\nAre you happy to give these to me?[VAR 0114(003B)]
[~ 9]
[~ 10]
Hrmm, as you wish. Remember—I’m counting on\nyou for these ingredients so I can treat Eevee to\r\na nice snack from my hometown.[VAR 0114(003B)]
Wonderful! These ingredients look nice and fresh.\nI’ll get cooking, so wait here awhile, would you?[VAR 0114(003B)]
OK! They’re all done![VAR 0114(003B)]
Let’s have a taste before giving one to Eevee,\nshall we?[VAR 0114(003B)]
[~ 15]
*munch munch*\nMmph... That’sh...inchereshting...[VAR 0114(003B)]
I guess the taste is fine, but...it’s just not the same\nas the muffins from my hometown.\c\nI remember them being more moist and having\nthis nice, delicate flavor to them...[VAR 0114(003B)]
Sorry to waste your time after all the trouble you\nwent through to gather the ingredients for us.\c\nBut I’m afraid these mediocre muffins won’t be\nenough to get me in Eevee’s good books.[VAR 0114(003B)]
Oh? What’s the matter, Eevee?[VAR 0114(003B)]
Do you want one...? Well, I won’t stop you.\nHere you go![VAR 0114(003B)]
Vee!
You like it that much? Th-that’s great! I’m so glad![VAR 0114(003B)]
Vevee!
Hm? You want another? I don’t think that’s wise...\nToo many snacks will give you a bellyache![VAR 0114(003B)]
Eee?
Oh, now who could resist that cute little face!\nI’ll spoil you rotten if I’m not careful, yes I will![VAR 0114(003B)]
Thanks to you, it seems Eevee and I will get on\njust fine. More than fine, even! I’m in your debt.[VAR 0114(003B)]
As for my new muffin creations—they’re not quite\nthe same as the ones from my hometown, so...\r\nhow about we call them Jubilife Muffins instead?[VAR 0114(003B)]
I think I know just what to do to make them even\ntastier for my darling Eevee, too.\c\nI’ve jotted down my ideas, so here—you should\ntry making some for yourself![VAR 0114(003B)]

Hello there. So, you’re the Survey Corps child\nwho quelled the Lord of the Woods, are you?[VAR 0114(0068)]
Think you could help with setting up our new\nbase camp? We’re making one up by the bogs.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Our Odo could sure use someone as capable as\nyou. He’s a fresh Construction Corps recruit, still\r\nlearning the ropes.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Whoa there. I’d keep your distance, if I were you.[VAR 0114(0087)]
Just look at those bothers! They’re taking up the\nspot where I was going to set up a base camp.[VAR 0114(0087)]
One Stunky would be a headache, but this little\ngroup is a full-blown migraine!\c\nMaybe I can get someone else from the team\nto handle this—someone good at battling...[VAR 0114(0087)]
I’m not bad
I’ll drive them off
Are you sure you’re up to this, though? They\nstink something fierce.[VAR 0114(0087)]
Leave it to me!
Just watch!
Well, if you insist. But you’ve got to beat three\nof them, so be ready to run...and stay downwind![VAR 0114(0087)]
I came all this way to set up base camp, just to\nrun into a group of Stunky...\r\nThis reeks of disappointment.[VAR 0114(0087)]
Whoa, whoa! Think before you rush in. Give me a\nsecond to heal your Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0087)]
All right, your Pokémon should be healthy now.\c\nGood luck—I’m counting on you![VAR 0114(0087)]
Prepare for battle, then try again!
You weren’t kidding—you’ve got talent! And your\nPokémon w[VAR 1101(00FD,0302)]asere so brave, too![VAR 0114(0087)]
I can’t believe you handled three Stunky all by\nyourself without getting smelly![VAR 0114(0087)]
Thanks to you, we can get the base camp set up\nnow. Hold on a minute.[VAR 0114(0087)]
There we go. What do you think? Makes things\nfeel a little safer out here, no?[VAR 0114(0087)]
And there’s not a whiff of Stunky here, either.\nStop by anytime![VAR 0114(0087)]
This makes a second base camp for us to use in\nthe Crimson Mirelands!\c\nPerhaps some Stunky will pop by for fun and\ngames sometime, eh? Wouldn’t that be a treat![VAR 0114(0005)]

I’ve been waiting for you, kiddo. Let’s get down\nto business—have a look at that Sudowoodo.[VAR 0114(0087)]
It was looking pretty listless, so I gave it a whole\nfeast of Berries...[VAR 0114(0087)]
But even though it gobbled them up, it still seems\nlike it has no energy at all. Isn’t that odd?[VAR 0114(0087)]
So then I figured it must be parched. After all, it’s\nlike a plant, right? It must need to be watered.[VAR 0114(0087)]
So if we could just fire off a healthy Water Pulse\nat it, I’m sure it’d perk up in no time![VAR 0114(0087)]
You’re right!
Uhhh, actually...
What? You don’t agree? But plants LOVE water![VAR 0114(0087)]
Bring me a Pokémon that can use Water Pulse\nso we can get Sudowoodo feeling right as rain![VAR 0114(0087)]
Did you do like I asked? Did you bring me a\nPokémon that can use Water Pulse?[VAR 0114(0087)]
All right! Get ready, Sudowoodo! All your worries\nare about to be washed away for good![VAR 0114(0087)]
Yeah! Let’s do it!
Guess we’re doing this...
Wo doooooo?!
No-doooooo!
Well, it’s certainly got plenty of energy now!\nBut what’s it all upset about?!\c\nIf we don’t find some way to calm it down, it’ll\ndestroy the camp! Do something![VAR 0114(0087)]
Woooooo...
Maybe...it doesn’t like getting wet?[VAR 0114(0087)]
Do!
Is that it? Gosh, I guess I rained on your parade.\nSorry, Sudowoodo.[VAR 0114(0087)]
Su su...
And I’m sorry for making you a part of this, too.\nI thought I was helping, but when you get right\r\ndown to it, I just didn’t understand Sudowoodo.[VAR 0114(0087)]
Keep working hard on that Pokédex to educate\npoor fools like me, would you?[VAR 0114(0087)]

Um, this is kind of a secret, but...\c\nsomething terrible has happened. Hisui is in a\nwhole lot of danger.[VAR 0114(0056)]
Hundreds of years ago, a being that brought\ncalamity to this region was sealed away by\r\nsomeone using the power of a strange magic.\c\nBut now, for some unknown reason, the magic\nhas come undone and the seal is broken.[VAR 0114(0056)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I hate to think what might happen at this rate...\c\nSo please, [VAR 0100(0000)], hear\nme out.\c\nI need you to restore the broken seal...[VAR 0114(0056)]
Just tell me what to do!
I don’t believe you
Oh, thank you! I’m so happy you believe me!\nI just knew you’d be willing to help.[VAR 0114(0056)]
This Odd Keystone is for you. Keep it safe.[VAR 0114(0056)]
Yeah, I guess that’s a normal response to hearing\nsuch a strange story. I must sound crazy...\c\nBut...you just have to believe me![VAR 0114(0056)]
Can I give you this Odd Keystone anyway?\nIt’ll help you see I’m telling the truth.[VAR 0114(0056)]
After the seal was broken, a whooole bunch of\nwisps scattered across Hisui...[VAR 0114(0056)]
A hundred and seven of them in total.\c\nWith the Odd Keystone I gave you, you’ll be\nable to gather them all.[VAR 0114(0056)]
See, the wisps are normally invisible. But not to\nthe holder of the Odd Keystone.[VAR 0114(0056)]
I know it’s a huge task, but please...you just\nhave to gather all the wisps for me!\c\nThere’s one real close to where we are now.\nHow about you start with that one?[VAR 0114(0056)]
See that flame hovering over there?\nTry touching it![VAR 0114(0056)]
The wisp...has been absorbed into the Odd\nKeystone, just as it should have been.[VAR 0114(0056)]
Thank goodness I picked you to help me\nwith this...[VAR 0114(0056)]
Come talk to me if you ever need help finding\nthe remaining wisps!\c\nAnd one last thing—as you gather more and more\nwisps, I’ll give you some rewards as thanks![VAR 0114(0056)]
I’ll wait here for you while you carry out your\nsearch. Good luck![VAR 0114(0056)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Wait, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Where are you\ngoing?\r\nYou need to touch the wisp![VAR 0114(0056)]
Wow! You’ve gathered every last one of\nthe wisps! I really can’t thank you enough.[VAR 0114(0056)]
*sigh*\nNow we can finally seal away that\r\nhavoc-wreaking bundle of mischief once more.[VAR 0114(0056)]
But...we’ll need to go to the Shrouded Ruins.\nThat’s the only place the sealing will work...[VAR 0114(0056)]
We should meet there at the same time of day\nas when we first met. Hope you remember![VAR 0114(0056)]
I’ll be waiting for you there, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nDon’t you dare forget![VAR 0114(0056)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! I’m glad you came.\nLet’s get\r\nstarted,\r\nshall we?[VAR 0114(0056)]
First of all, a confession. I may have told you\none teeny-tiny lie.[VAR 0114(0056)]
About the wisps...there are actually 108 of them.\c\nI’ve been holding on to the last one—could you\nput it in the Odd Keystone with the others?[VAR 0114(0056)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]But wait—before that, well...\n[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]...\r\nWhat\r\ndo you\r\nthink\r\nof me?[VAR 0114(0056)]
You’re a strange one...
I don’t really know you...
A “strange one,” huh...? Yeah, you’re right.\nYou really do understand me.[VAR 0114(0056)]
...Really? Even after gathering 107 wisps?\nAh well, it’s fine. We have time, after all.[VAR 0114(0056)]
Here it goes, the final wisp...\c\nAfter this, the traveler who used that strange\nmagic will finally forgive me...right?\c\nAh. Close your eyes for a sec, would you?[VAR 0114(0056)]
The Odd Keystone started glowing!
The Odd Keystone disappeared without a trace...
Making you gather all those wisps was my last\nbit of mischief... Thanks for playing along.\c\nPlease...don’t forget about me...
You sense the presence of a strange Pokémon...
Vessa is nowhere to be seen... You should come\nback at night to look for her.

My grandmother was precisely like you—the type\nof person who could understand the minds and\r\nhearts of Pokémon.\c\nI grew up watching how she interacted with them,\nso I have a bit of a knack for sensing how\r\ncompatible a person and a Pokémon are.[VAR 0114(0046)]
If you’d like to, you can keep on coming to show\nme your Pokémon.\c\nI’m happy to inform you at any time how they’re\nfeeling about you.[VAR 0114(0046)]

Listen here, Survey Corps kid. I saw the\ndarndest thing.[VAR 0114(0038)]
I was scouring the Heartwood for crops we could\ngrow in the fields here when I saw it...\c\nThis Pokémon called Cherrim changed its\nappearance before my very eyes![VAR 0114(0038)]
It was in the evening. The light was getting dim.\c\nAll of a sudden, Cherrim’s petals closed right up\nso it looked like nothin’ but a little flower bud.\c\n“Wow,” I thought, “I just witnessed the miracle\nof Evolution!”[VAR 0114(0038)]
But the next morning, when I went to check in on\nthat Cherrim, it was right back to full bloom![VAR 0114(0038)]
But why would it bloom just to close back up?\nIs that how Evolution works...or was the change I\r\nsaw something different?\c\nWhen you finish Cherrim’s Pokédex entry, let me\nhave a look, wouldja?[VAR 0114(0038)]

Wow, you sure went into detail. Uh-huh, uh-huh...\nI see.[VAR 0114(0038)]
So, it changes its form when the sun’s hidden.\c\nGuess I didn’t see it evolve. I just saw that\nchange in action.[VAR 0114(0038)]

Oh, hello! Thanks again for finding me those\nOran Berries.[VAR 0114(0045)]
I had a wretched time in the fieldlands, getting\nharried by Pokémon left and right. They even got\r\nme with a few of their moves...\c\nBut I did get those Tumblestones, so I think I’ve\nearned some time to cool my heels here.[VAR 0114(0045)]
I didn’t even have a chance to use all the Oran\nBerries you got me—but they made a lovely snack.\c\nIt’s nice to be able to carry so much. Asking that\nfellow at headquarters to help me fit more in my\r\nsatchel was definitely the right move.[VAR 0114(0045)]
So, helpful soul that you are, I suppose you’re\nhere about my request to the professor?[VAR 0114(0045)]
On to the matter at hand, then. Would you mind\ninvestigating the Mr. Mime that’s taken up\r\nresidence here in the village?[VAR 0114(0045)]
Just having a wild Pokémon among us is scary\nenough, and then there’s the eerie way it moves...[VAR 0114(0045)]
The Security Corps refused to handle it, for\nwhatever reason. I’m hoping a Survey Corps\r\nperson like you can help me out.[VAR 0114(0045)]
Look! It’s over there![VAR 0114(0045)]
See what it’s up to, would you?[VAR 0114(0045)]
Get closer to that Mr. Mime and see what it’s\ndoing, would you?[VAR 0114(0045)]
It ran off that way![VAR 0114(0045)]
It wouldn’t run unless it had something to hide!\nNow we’ve really got to find out what it’s up to.[VAR 0114(0045)]
Look! That Mr. Mime ran right up there![VAR 0114(0045)]
You know, you’ve got a...roundabout way of\ntrying to get up close to Pokémon. Are you\r\nsecretly scared of them or something?[VAR 0114(0045)]
Something blocked me
It’s these invisible walls
What? You’re joking! Unless that Mr. Mime is\nusing some kind of mysterious power...\c\nWhatever the case, this calls for\nfurther research![VAR 0114(0045)]
I’ve got to get after that Mr. Mime. Come quick![VAR 0114(0045)]
There you are. Look—Mr. Mime’s over there.[VAR 0114(0045)]
Go see if it’s really making walls![VAR 0114(0045)]

Whoa! I...I can’t go any further![VAR 0114(0045)]
There’s definitely something here I can’t see![VAR 0114(0045)]
What is it, Mr. Mime? Looks like something’s got\nyou in a panic.[VAR 0114(0030)]
What? Ress, you know this Mr. Mime?[VAR 0114(0045)]
Yep. It helps me guard the gate sometimes.\c\nWhen it stands out front and does that eerie\ndance, wild Pokémon can’t get in. It’s like there’s\r\nsome kind of invisible wall.[VAR 0114(0030)]
It’s docile, and it helps me with my job, so I just\nlet it do as it pleases.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Who would have thought...[VAR 0114(0045)]
Sorry to make you go to all that trouble. But it\nbrought me some peace of mind, if nothing else.[VAR 0114(0045)]
If we’ve got invisible walls cropping up here and\nthere, folks had better keep an eye out!\c\nOr...perhaps not an eye... Well, however one\nwatches out for invisible obstacles![VAR 0114(0045)]

You’ve completed Kricketot’s Pokédex page?\nGreat! Quickly now, let me have a look![VAR 0114(0055)]

Ohhh, so Kricketot produce that curious sound\nof theirs by hitting their antennae together!\c\nHmm...I wonder if Anvin from the Supply Corps\ncould put together an instrument with a similar\r\nshape to those antennae...[VAR 0114(0055)]
Well for now, thanks for going out of your way\nto solve this tonal enigma! Here, take these.[VAR 0114(0055)]

Ooh, you’re that [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl from the Survey Corps\nwho fell from the sky, aren’t you?\c\nListen here a moment. I need to tell you about\nthis great cake-lure recipe I invented![VAR 0114(002E)]
I call it...the Mushroom Cake! I poured 20 years\nof mushroom foraging know-how into coming up\r\nwith this recipe, and I just know it’s a winner.\c\nProblem is, the folks around here just aren’t\ncatching on to my recipe’s amazing potential...[VAR 0114(002E)]
But you’re the talk of the village! If people see\nyou making my Mushroom Cakes, famous as you\r\nare, I’m sure they’ll want to give it a go, too.\c\nI’ll teach you the recipe—all you have to do in\nreturn is spread the good word by using it![VAR 0114(002E)]
Oh, and you’ll need to go get the key ingredient\nfor the recipe yourself. “Scrounge not from the\r\nforages of thy fellows,” as the old saying goes!\c\nOne Springy Mushroom’s all you need.\nI’ll be waiting![VAR 0114(002E)]
If you want to learn my amazing recipe, you’ll\nneed to bring me one Springy Mushroom![VAR 0114(002E)]

Oh! Now that’s a nice Springy Mushroom if I ever\ndid see one!\c\nI’m glad I chose you for my request. You’ve got\nwhat it takes to be a fine mushroom forager![VAR 0114(002E)]
But I digress. Let’s get to teaching you my recipe.\nI’ll just use that handy workbench over there...[VAR 0114(002E)]
By the by, did you know that Springy Mushrooms\nlike this one multiply in no time? That’s why you’ll\r\nfind them all over the Obsidian Fieldlands!\c\nAnd they’re versatile, too. Fry ’em, stew ’em—\nthey’ll taste great either way![VAR 0114(002E)]
And here you have it! The delectable Mushroom\nCake, beloved by Pokémon far and wide![VAR 0114(002E)]
Just throw one at a wild Pokémon and, if it’s\npartial to a nice mushroom snack, you can bet\r\nyour bottom toadstool it’ll go after the cake-lure.\c\nYou can use that opening to make your getaway,\nor, of course, to try to catch the Pokémon![VAR 0114(002E)]
Here—I’ll give you some of my own Cake-Lure\nBases so you can get crafting right away.[VAR 0114(002E)]
Now get out there and throw a generous—no,\ngratuitous—number of Mushroom Cakes to lure\r\nPokémon left, right, and center, you hear?\c\nI’m counting on you to make my recipe famous![VAR 0114(002E)]

Listen—I’ve been gathering Combee honey for\nwork, and I’m starting to think that their honey’s\r\nflavor varies between groups of Combee.[VAR 0114(0039)]
I’d like to look into the differences more. But\nthat’d mean collecting honey from Combee\r\nhives in all sorts of areas, and that’s a bit too\r\nmuch for this lone fella.[VAR 0114(0039)]
That’s where you come in! I’d love if you could\nbring me Combee from three different areas.\c\nFirst, get me a Combee from Grueling Grove,\nwould you?[VAR 0114(0039)]

*slurp*[VAR 0114(0039)]
That’s exactly what honey should be. Tastes like\na distilled drop of nutritious, forest-y goodness![VAR 0114(0039)]
But I get the feeling it doesn’t quite taste like\nhoney from other areas...\c\nI’ll make sure to memorize this flavor. Let’s move\non—two more places to check![VAR 0114(0039)]
The next Combee I’m after lives on Aipom Hill.\nCould you bring me one from there?[VAR 0114(0039)]
Whoa, now! Is that one of those alphas I’ve\nheard about?!\c\nBet you with a Combee this big, I could harvest a\nwhole year’s worth of honey![VAR 0114(0039)]
Brought me a Combee from Aipom Hill,\nhave you?[VAR 0114(0039)]
Not too heavy on the sweetness. Just honey,\nplain and simple...and good enough to serve as a\r\nspecial treat on its own![VAR 0114(0039)]
This one definitely tasted different from the\nGrueling Grove honey! I’ll make sure to\r\nmemorize this flavor.[VAR 0114(0039)]
All right, here’s the last of these errands: Could\nyou bring me a Combee from Ramanas Island?[VAR 0114(0039)]
Brought me a Combee from Ramanas Island,\nhave you?[VAR 0114(0039)]
This type of honey just begs to be stirred into a\ncup of tea! Must be something different about\r\nthe flowers...[VAR 0114(0039)]
So Combee in different areas make differently\nflavored honey! What a delightfully mysterious\r\nbunch they are![VAR 0114(0039)]
Just think how many different clusters of Combee\nthere are in the Obsidian Fieldlands alone.\r\nI’m getting the urge to go collect more honey![VAR 0114(0039)]
Thanks for helping me confirm my suspicions.\nHave some of my hand-selected Dazzling Honey![VAR 0114(0039)]

In fact, I’d like to ask your help once again,\nif I might. Would you take a look at this?[VAR 0114(005A)]
At first it looks like a perfectly normal landscape\nshot, wouldn’t you say?\c\nBut take a closer look, and you start to notice\nsomething odd about the pair of leaves there\r\nin the foreground of the image.[VAR 0114(005A)]
That conspicuous pair of leaves, popping into\nthe frame like that...\c\nI’m inclined to think they could be part of some\nPokémon, but I’ve got no proof, you see.[VAR 0114(005A)]

If you’re open to it, I certainly hope you’ll keep\nbringing your Pokémon by to take many more\r\nphotographs here.[VAR 0114(005A)]
That certainly is an attractive specimen worth\ncapturing on film! But I don’t think that’s what\r\nappeared in my photo. Does it truly not exist?[VAR 0114(005A)]
Now that is quite the pair of leaves! And they\ncertainly do look like those in the photograph!\r\nSee! I knew it was a Pokémon I’d captured![VAR 0114(005A)]

There’s a Pokémon I think would be the perfect\ninspiration for some new designs.[VAR 0114(001D)]
It’s the species called Shellos, you see. I’ve heard\nit has different forms depending on where it\r\nlives—with different coloring, too![VAR 0114(001D)]
If I could just compare its different forms, I’m\ncertain I’d be filled with inspiration.\c\nCould you show me Shellos’ different forms?\nOne can be found in the Obsidian Fieldlands,\r\nand the other out in the Cobalt Coastlands.[VAR 0114(001D)]
Please show me a Shellos from the Obsidian\nFieldlands and one from the Cobalt Coastlands\r\nonce you’ve caught them![VAR 0114(001D)]
You’ve caught the Shellos I asked about? I’d like\nto see the pink one first, then![VAR 0114(001D)]
Could you show me the light blue one now, too?[VAR 0114(001D)]
I’ve heard that the Shellos found in the Obsidian\nFieldlands is pink. Could I see that one first?[VAR 0114(001D)]
You’ve already shown me Shellos of that color.\nI want to see the light blue one![VAR 0114(001D)]
It’s quite beyond me why Shellos would have\ndifferent colors, but I think it’s absolutely\r\ncharming that they change things up depending\r\non where they live![VAR 0114(001D)]
We here in Jubilife Village have also journeyed\nfar from where we used to live...\c\nMaybe a change in the color of our clothing is\nwhat we need, just like Shellos![VAR 0114(001D)]
I took advantage of the inspiration I was feeling\nand expanded my lineup! I would be very\r\npleased if you would have a look.[VAR 0114(001D)]

Well, I’ll be! Its tail is like a tightly wound spring,\nand it’s thick as a rope, to boot!\r\nNot half bad, I must say.[VAR 0114(0063)]
But the tail I’m looking for should belong to a\nsmaller Pokémon, about the size of a Bidoof...\c\nI’m beggin’ you here! Find that beautiful, elegant\ntail for me, would you?[VAR 0114(0063)]
YES! This is it! It’s just as I remember!\nThe elegant sway of its tail![VAR 0114(0063)]

I was down by the sea gathering fresh ingredients\nrecently when, wouldn’t you know it, an Octillery\r\npopped up and sprayed me with ink![VAR 0114(002B)]
But here’s the thing—the ink... Well, it actually\ntasted rather good![VAR 0114(002B)]
Inspiration, quite literally, struck me at\nthat moment!\c\nI knew I could use this ink to create pickles the\nlikes of which the world has never seen...[VAR 0114(002B)]
But making food out of something a Pokémon\nhas spat up seems risky to say the least, no?\r\nSo a little research on Octillery is in order, I think![VAR 0114(002B)]
That’s where you come in, dear. If you learn more\nabout Octillery, please let me know.[VAR 0114(002B)]
I believe Octillery ink has fantastic potential\nas a pickle ingredient, as you know, dear.\c\nIf you’ve figured out Octillery’s secrets,\nI’m all ears![VAR 0114(002B)]
Oh! So you’ve looked into Octillery for me, have\nyou? Lovely! Let’s hear what you’ve learned.[VAR 0114(002B)]

Gah, this is hopeless! Where could he\nhave gone?[VAR 0114(0075)]
Would you mind helping me track him down?\c\nI’ll be waiting a little further ahead. Please come\nsee me when you have a moment.[VAR 0114(0075)]
Oh, you’re here. I’ve been waiting.\c\nLike I said, I need your help finding Yorrich from\nthe Construction Corps.[VAR 0114(0075)]
He and I came out here to set up a base camp,\nbut then he went off on his own to get the lay of\r\nthe land...and hasn’t come back.[VAR 0114(0075)]
Yorrich ought to still be somewhere nearby!\c\nIf you find him, please tell him to come back\nhere already.[VAR 0114(0075)]
S-stay away![VAR 0114(0088)]
Away! Stay!
Gwaaah! Why is this Pokémon talking?![VAR 0114(0088)]
Talk?! Twaaalk?!
You all right?
Having fun?
Far from it! Help me!
No, the opposite! Help me!
Halp me!
Gaaah! I’m done for![VAR 0114(0088)]
You have no Pokémon that can battle. Better\nregroup and come back prepared.
Thank goodness! I don’t know if I’d have survived\nwithout you![VAR 0114(0088)]
No one told me there’d be Pokémon that talk\nlike people out here! What a fright![VAR 0114(0088)]
Back where I grew up, folks often said that if you\nhear someone talk when nobody’s around, it’s\r\nnot a ghost playing tricks—it’s just a Chatot.[VAR 0114(0075)]
Anyway, thank you kindly for finding Yorrich.\nI’ll have him set up camp now![VAR 0114(0075)]
Hup, two! Ready, and...lift![VAR 0114(0088)]
Aaand lift! Aaand lift![VAR 0114(0004)]
All finished![VAR 0114(0088)]
I’m sure that awful voice I heard mimicking me\nwas...just my imagination...[VAR 0114(0088)]
I owe you big time, young Survey Corps recruit!\nCome take a rest here at camp anytime you like.[VAR 0114(0088)]
What a splendidly scenic base camp!\c\nThis ought to be quite convenient for surveying\nPokémon that live on the waterfront.[VAR 0114(0005)]

Captain Zisu has set me to all sorts of training,\nbut I don’t feel like I’m really improving at all...\r\nSo I came here to train with my partner, Pachirisu.[VAR 0114(0034)]
But I simply can’t seem to figure out any winning\nstrategy to use with Pachirisu...[VAR 0114(0034)]
I’ve heard tales about you, though, and your\nstrength in battle. Could I ask you to show me\r\nhow a Pokémon like Pachirisu can truly shine\r\nin battle?[VAR 0114(0034)]
I want to see you battle with a single Pachirisu.\nNo more, and no other Pokémon. If you think\r\nyou can show me how it’s done, I’ll be waiting.[VAR 0114(0034)]
Ready to show me what Pachirisu can do?\nLet’s see it battle...against a mighty Ursaring![VAR 0114(0034)]
Watch and learn!
Maybe later...
Well, once you do work out a great way to battle\nwith a Pachirisu, show me...against Ursaring![VAR 0114(0034)]
All right! I’ve made sure your Pachirisu is all\nhealed up and in fighting form.[VAR 0114(0034)]
Ha! That’s the spirit! Now follow me.[VAR 0114(0034)]
Seems like this is one challenge that will require\nmethods beyond the ordinary...\c\nIf you do figure out an amazing way to battle\nwith Pachirisu, come back and show me![VAR 0114(0034)]
Astonishing! That really was amazing! You\ndefeated an Ursaring with a Pachirisu!\c\nAnd your Pachirisu was so pumped up and eager\nfor battle, it looked like it was fearless![VAR 0114(0034)]
You directed Pachirisu with such aplomb in\nbattle—it was clear how well you understood it!\c\nI guess all the work you Survey Corps members\nput into learning about Pokémon does pay off.[VAR 0114(0034)]
But we won’t be outdone! We’ll work hard to\nreach that same level of understanding![VAR 0114(0034)]
Pachi!

Hey, what’s that Pokémon up there? What’s its\nname? What’s it do?[VAR 0114(0069)]
It’s a Magikarp
It splashes around a lot!
Magikarp? Why is it called Magikarp?! Is it a cool\nPokémon? Is it strong? Can it fly?[VAR 0114(0069)]
It splashes? Is that a move? Is it strong? Is it\ncool? Does that mean it can fly?[VAR 0114(0069)]
No, it can’t fly
It’s pretty cool
Why can’t it fly? Aren’t those flappy things its\nwings? Tell me, tell me![VAR 0114(0069)]
It’s cool? Why is it cool? Which part is cool?\nTell me, tell me![VAR 0114(0069)]
Tell me more! Please! Pleeeaaase![VAR 0114(0069)]
You’re gonna go learn about Magikarp, right?\nCan you tell me when you’re all done with its\r\npage in your pokey-dex?[VAR 0114(0069)]
Is Magikarp’s page filled in yet? Tell me, tell me![VAR 0114(0069)]
I know all about Magikarp now! I’m a\nMagikarp professor![VAR 0114(0069)]
Now it’s my turn to tell you something! Sanqua\ntold me a secret![VAR 0114(0069)]
Sanqua said she made those Magikarp statues.\c\nBut she said she really wanted to make Gyarados\nstatues instead![VAR 0114(0069)]
She said that Gyarados is super strong and cool\nand can even fly! And that Magikarp can\r\nbecome Gyarados![VAR 0114(0069)]
You’ll learn more about Gyarados too,\nright? Pleeeaaase?[VAR 0114(0069)]

You’re part of the Survey Corps, right? Could you\nhelp me out?[VAR 0114(003F)]
It seems this Pokémon’s so hungry that it can\nbarely even move.[VAR 0114(003F)]
I tried giving it food, but it wouldn’t take a bite.\nI don’t know if it’s being stubborn or what.\c\nIt showed some interest in Plump Beans, but it\nstill wouldn’t eat them.[VAR 0114(003F)]
We could use crafting
We could make it special
Oh, of course! If we make the Plump Beans\nextra tasty, I’m sure this little dear will eat them![VAR 0114(003F)]
What kind of Supply Corps member am I to\ncompletely forget about crafting?[VAR 0114(003F)]
In any case, maybe Bean Cakes will do the trick!\c\nCould you make me one? If you need the recipe,\nyou can find it at the craftworks![VAR 0114(003F)]
If you have any Bean Cakes, could you give me\none? You can buy the recipe for them at\r\nthe craftworks.[VAR 0114(003F)]
Piiip...
Could you give me a Bean Cake?[VAR 0114(003F)]
[~ 11]

Great! Actually, why don’t you give it to Piplup?\nLet it eat out of your hands.[VAR 0114(003F)]

Pi? Piluuu?
Oh wow, it ate the whole thing already? It’s got\nquite the appetite, that’s for sure.[VAR 0114(003F)]
I’ve quite taken a liking to little Piplup!\c\nAnd I don’t think it’s safe to let it wander around.\nI’ll bring it back to the village and take care of it.[VAR 0114(003F)]

There you are! I’ve been looking for you![VAR 0114(0091)]
My sister Wanda went off to the Cobalt\nCoastlands, and she never came back![VAR 0114(0091)]
I’ve asked her fellows in the Security Corps to be\non the lookout, but they haven’t found her...\c\nI’m so worried. Do you think you can find her?[VAR 0114(0091)]
You can use that old kerchief of hers again, if\nyou need to track her down by her scent.[VAR 0114(0091)]
[~ 4]
Please find Wanda again for me! She should be\nsomewhere in the Cobalt Coastlands![VAR 0114(0091)]
Wanda went to the Cobalt Coastlands on duty,\nbut she hasn’t come back!\c\nPlease use Ursaluna’s special skills to track her\ndown wherever she’s gone![VAR 0114(0091)]
Oh, [VAR 0189(0000)]! You came to find me?![VAR 0114(0070)]
I got the old heave-ho from this Machop, see,\nand—SPLASH! It was right into the sea for me.[VAR 0114(0070)]
And then I couldn’t swim back to the shore on\nmy own, so I was just stranded...so...um...\r\nPlease! Can you help me get back home?[VAR 0114(0070)]
No problem!
Guess I’ve got to...
[VAR BD06(0000)]Thanks a million for your help,\n[VAR 0189(0000)]!\r\nI’ll\r\npay\r\nyou\r\nback somehow![VAR 0114(0070)]
My oh my, that Basculegion sure is something!\c\nIt zips right through the water, even with the\nweight of a person or two on its back... Amazing![VAR 0114(0070)]
I was supposed to be out there looking for other\npeople’s lost items, but instead I got found...[VAR 0114(0070)]
Wanda made it back home safe again! I really\ncan’t thank you enough!\c\nI knew I wouldn’t be wrong to ask you again.\nYou’re still as good as everyone says you are![VAR 0114(0091)]
And that Ursaluna is amazing, too. Not many can\ntrack a scent even across rivers and seas![VAR 0114(0091)]
If I could ever learn to live with Pokémon myself,\na Pokémon like that Ursaluna sure would be nice.\r\nYeah, a Pokémon that’s great at finding things![VAR 0114(0091)]

Ah, you’re here for my request about Croagunk?[VAR 0114(0020)]
[~ 1]
[~ 2]
A member of the Diamond Clan told me\nthat they make medicine by diluting\r\nCroagunk’s poison![VAR 0114(0020)]
Medicine made from Croagunk’s poison can\napparently relieve pain in the lower back.\c\nI’d love to have some to give Buck. The poor\ngentleman’s bedridden from back pain.[VAR 0114(0020)]
I know how to make the medicine, so all I need is\nsome help getting my hands on Croagunk poison.[VAR 0114(0020)]
Head to the Crimson Mirelands and catch me\na Croagunk, would you?[VAR 0114(0020)]
Will you let me have a Croagunk?[VAR 0114(0020)]
[~ 8]
[~ 9]
[~ 10]
[~ 11]
So this is Croagunk! Got a charming little face,\nhasn’t it?[VAR 0114(0020)]
I need a smidgen of your poison, please,\nCroagunk. Would you be so kind?[VAR 0114(0020)]
Grunk.
Thanks very much!\nNow to whip up that medicine...[VAR 0114(0020)]
There we have it!\nThis ought to be super effective.[VAR 0114(0020)]
Pokémon come to our aid in surprising ways\nsometimes, don’t they?\c\nI bet we’d be able to help an even greater range\nof people and Pokémon if we could set up some\r\nkind of...aid facility where Pokémon worked side\r\nby side with us.[VAR 0114(0020)]
Of course, we’ll need to learn much more about\nPokémon if that’s ever to happen.\c\nI’m starting to think the Survey Corps’ work will\nhelp us in ways people aren’t even aware of.[VAR 0114(0020)]
Pesseeelle! My poor back! It’s screamin’![VAR 0114(0067)]
One moment! I’ve got a medicine that ought to\nbe a great help.[VAR 0114(0020)]
It looks like we’ll have Buck up on his feet again\nthanks to you and Croagunk![VAR 0114(0020)]
I need Croagunk’s poison to make medicine.\nPlease let me have a Croagunk, if you catch one![VAR 0114(0020)]
The medicine should take effect before long.\nIt’s bound to help Buck’s back feel better.[VAR 0114(0020)]
Groak.
I’m gonna make a wood carving of Croagunk to\nshow it how grateful I am![VAR 0114(0067)]
Croagunk’s medicine seems to have worked like\na charm.\c\nBuck is back to work chopping trees, apparently\nfeeling better than ever.[VAR 0114(0020)]
Meanwhile, Croagunk here has been hard at work\nmaking nice with everybody.[VAR 0114(0020)]
Croaooo!

What are the odds? Fate must have my back\ntoday, bringing you here!\c\nLook, I know we just met, but would you do\nsomething for me?[VAR 0114(0062)]
I’d love it if you could bring me that Pokémon...\nAh, what’s its name again? Well, the one with a\r\nscythe on each arm![VAR 0114(0062)]
All right
Not a chance
Hah hah hah! C’mon, surely you can find it in\nyour heart to do such a small task![VAR 0114(0062)]
Excellent. I had a feeling you’d say that!\c\nHm? Never mind why I need it. Just bring me\nthat Pokémon with a scythe on each arm![VAR 0114(0062)]
Please bring me that Pokémon—you know, the\none with a scythe on each arm![VAR 0114(0062)]
Guess you must’ve brought me that Pokémon\nwith a scythe on each of its arms?\c\nGo on—show it to me, please![VAR 0114(0062)]
Look at those keen blades. They’ll make short\nwork of this![VAR 0114(0062)]
You see the Ramanas roses blooming all over this\nisland? I have to gather every last one![VAR 0114(0062)]
I’ve been trying to pluck all of them myself.\nHaving this—ah, yes—Scyther’s help will make\r\nthings much smoother![VAR 0114(0062)]
Now hold on...
ALL the roses?
They’re for my wife, y’see! She told me\nshe wanted to fill our garden with these\r\nRamanas roses.\c\nSo I’m gathering every last one here to fill that\ngarden right up for my darling dear![VAR 0114(0062)]
You’re taking it too far
I think she just meant...
What?[VAR 0114(0062)]
S-seriously?![VAR 0114(0062)]
So she just meant...to plant some? Well, that was\na pretty severe misunderstanding.[VAR 0114(0062)]
I’m glad you came along before I plucked every\nrose on this island![VAR 0114(0062)]
I’ll just bring some of their seeds home for us to\nraise together. Take care![VAR 0114(0062)]

Hello there! Is this your first crack at the balloon\nrace? Or maybe you’ve had a go before?\c\nEither way, why not team up with Pokémon and\ntry out my fun balloon-bursting game?
You just need to burst as many of my adorable\nballoons as possible while riding a Pokémon.\r\nIt’s exhilarating, really!
If you manage to burst, say, 24 balloons, well,\nthat’d be an impressive start!
You can find me here any time, so let me know\nwhenever you feel like testing your skill in the\r\nballoon race!

And whaddya know? You beat my target of\nbursting at least 24 balloons! Well done, you!

Nice to see ya again, Mis[VAR 1100(00FF,0103)]ters Survey Corps!\nYou got great timin’, as always![VAR 0114(0037)]

Did ya bring a Pokémon that’s all ready to use\nthe move Rock Smash for us?[VAR 0114(0037)]
The move we really want is Rock Smash, hear?\nWe’re countin’ on ya![VAR 0114(0037)]
You’re lendin’ me an alpha?! Gee, that’s awful\nkind of ya! Those boulders are good as gone!\c\nI gotta say, takes an impressive [VAR 1100(00FF,0306)]fellergal to catch an\nalpha and get it to help folks out like this![VAR 0114(0037)]
Yer Pokémon’ll sure be a big help in expandin’\nthe fields. Might as well get started![VAR 0114(0037)]

Oh, it’s my most valued customer. I was just\nhoping you’d come by![VAR 0114(001C)]
Need new goods again?
Something the matter?
Yes, it’s the same business all over again. Tao Hua\njust refuses to supply any new goods to me.[VAR 0114(001C)]
Oh, come on—you know how this goes by now.\nI need help getting new goods.\c\nTao Hua is once more refusing to supply anything\nto me.[VAR 0114(001C)]
I suppose you must be wondering why he refuses\nanytime I try to deal with him directly.\r\nWell, let’s just say he has his reasons...[VAR 0114(001C)]
Please speak to Tao Hua for me, would you?\nI imagine you’ll have better luck if you bring him\r\nsome Crunchy Salt as a gesture of goodwill.\r\nPerhaps three hunks, to be safe...[VAR 0114(001C)]
Oho, if it isn’t the Survey Corps recruit who\nquelled the Lord of the Isles!\c\nHas Choy sent you to do the negotiating for\nhim again?[VAR 0114(0021)]
You’re looking a little perplexed. Wondering why\nthis old man gets so stubborn over selling the\r\nshopkeeper a few things?[VAR 0114(0021)]
Well, maybe I’ll tell you...if you bring me three\nhunks of Crunchy Salt first.[VAR 0114(0021)]
[~ 10]
Bring me three hunks of Crunchy Salt, would you?[VAR 0114(0021)]

Brought what I asked for already? No less than I\nexpected of you. Wish I could persuade you to\r\njoin my corps.\c\nNow then—would you let me have three hunks of\nthat Crunchy Salt?[VAR 0114(0021)]
Ah, Crunchy Salt! The Coronet Highlands’\nfinest feature!\c\nIf you see it in the wild, don’t pass it over as if it\nwere just another rock. This translucent mineral’s\r\ngreat for making a potent Pokémon lure.[VAR 0114(0021)]
You’ve got to break it up with a hammer, then get\nthe chunks in a mortar and crunch ’em right up—\r\ngrind ’em into a powder.\c\nMix that powder with another ingredient and\npack the mix together, and you’ll get a crunchy\r\ncake that Pokémon love to munch on.[VAR 0114(0021)]
Well, I can’t send you back to Choy a failure,\nsince you so kindly brought me this Crunchy Salt.\r\nTell him I’ll set him up with some new wares.[VAR 0114(0021)]
Ah, I forgot—you wanted to know what\nhappened between me and Choy?\c\nWell, that whelp made off with my dearest\ntreasure! I’ll never let him live it down![VAR 0114(0021)]
We’ve got new goods in stock, thanks to you!\nBut you seem troubled. Is something the matter?[VAR 0114(001C)]
Tao Hua told me...
You stole his treasure?
Ah, he said I took his “treasure,” did he? That’s...\none way to put it, but the story’s not so simple.\r\nPlease believe me for now that it’s nothing you\r\nought to worry about.\c\nGiven what a fine customer you are, I imagine\nI’ll end up giving you the full story at some point.[VAR 0114(001C)]

This is an alpha Pokémon, isn’t it?! Amazing...\nLook how its body ripples like a cloud...\c\nI’ll be sure to use this as inspiration when I have\na customer as large and scary as an alpha![VAR 0114(0012)]

...Wait. That’s it! That’s what I’ll do![VAR 0114(0012)]
Wow, I just thought up some charming hairstyles!\nAnd an enchanting new palette of colors!\r\nAll thanks to you and Misdreavus here.[VAR 0114(0012)]

That nostalgic and unmistakable fragrance...\nIf only I could smell it again.\c\nI wonder if the herbs from my home region can\nbe found here in Hisui as well...[VAR 0114(0054)]
Oh, you’re part of the Survey Corps, right?\nMaybe you’ve seen what I’m looking for—it’s an\r\nherb that looks like a bluish vine.\c\nI’ve heard it clings to a specific Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0054)]
Please let me know if you manage to catch a\nPokémon that has herbs that look like blue\r\nvines hanging off it![VAR 0114(0054)]

That Pokémon doesn’t have the herbs I remember\nfrom home on it.\c\nPokémon with blue, vine-like herbs stuck to their\nbodies... Where could they live, I wonder?[VAR 0114(0054)]
Yes! Yes, those vines are exactly what I was\nlooking for!\c\nI can’t believe it really exists! I didn’t think there\ncould be a Pokémon so covered in herbs!\c\nI wonder where the plant ends and the\nPokémon begins...[VAR 0114(0054)]
Hmm...?[VAR 0114(0054)]
There’s a bit of bitterness to the aroma. This isn’t\nthe scent of the herb I know...[VAR 0114(0054)]
I don’t think this is the same herb we used back\nhome...but it’s close! So close!\c\nI wonder if this Pokémon is connected to the\nherb I’m looking for, somehow?[VAR 0114(0054)]
Astounding! Is this one of those alphas?!\c\nIt’s almost like the herbs from my home took\nshape and became a Pokémon themselves![VAR 0114(0054)]
[~ 13]
Just look at it! It’s a solid lump of vines![VAR 0114(0054)]
And this aroma... This is the scent I remember![VAR 0114(0054)]
Yes! THESE are the herbs from my home![VAR 0114(0054)]
I didn’t expect the Pokémon to be so absolutely\ncovered in herbs—I mean, vines.\c\nAnd...are the vines moving? I wonder what the\nPokémon itself looks like underneath all those...[VAR 0114(0054)]
Anyway, thank you for finding it![VAR 0114(0054)]
Don’t worry, I’m only going to take a little bit\nof your vines to use as herbs![VAR 0114(0054)]
Oh, I have an idea! If I lived with a Pokémon like\nyou, I’d be able to enjoy this aroma every day![VAR 0114(0054)]

Hey, you there, Survey Corps kid! I need your\nhelp catching a Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0097)]
The Construction Corps is busier than ever these\ndays, making homes for all the new people in\r\nthe village.\c\nWe just don’t have enough labor to handle\neverything. So we figured, why not try and see if\r\nPokémon could help us out?[VAR 0114(0097)]
I searched around awhile for a reliable Pokémon\nthat wouldn’t need much training...\c\nAnd I was lucky enough to find an incredibly\nrobust Pokémon called Machoke![VAR 0114(0097)]
Now, I’d love to get Machoke to join us myself...[VAR 0114(0097)]
But I don’t have the faintest idea how to go\nabout catching such a strong-looking Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0097)]
First thing to do, then, is to learn more about\nMachoke! Show me its completed Pokédex entry![VAR 0114(0097)]
Did you complete Machoke’s Pokédex entry?\nPlease, show me![VAR 0114(0097)]
So it likes grain, huh? And it certainly has a\nsturdy, powerful body...\c\nIt would be the perfect addition to the\nConstruction Corps![VAR 0114(0097)]

Thanks to you, I was able to catch a Machoke!\nI guess I owe the Survey Corps one.[VAR 0114(0097)]
It really seemed to enjoy the Grain Cake I threw\nat it. I promised we’d feed it lots of grain dishes,\r\nand that seems to be enough for it to help us![VAR 0114(0097)]
Macho![VAR 0114(00FA)]
You know, the recent exploits of the Survey\nCorps are what inspired me to get help from\r\nPokémon in the first place. Keep up the good\r\nwork, you hear?[VAR 0114(0097)]

Ah, good! I’ve been waiting for someone from\nthe Survey Corps to come along.[VAR 0114(0075)]
I want to gather crafting materials in Wayward\nCave, but I realized I’ve a bit of a problem...\c\nMy sense of direction is worse than useless.\c\nIf there’s any chance at all of getting lost in\nthat cave, you can bet that’s what I’ll do![VAR 0114(0075)]
But! I know a way to keep myself from stumbling\naround in the dark forever.\c\nSee, there’s an old saying in my hometown:\n“A Nosepass never wanders.”[VAR 0114(0075)]
Since Nosepass always face the same direction,\npeople from my village would look to this\r\nPokémon for guidance when they’d lost\r\ntheir way!\c\nThough I admit I’ve not actually seen a Nosepass\nbefore in my life...[VAR 0114(0075)]
But little matter! I just need to find myself a\nNosepass before I find myself hopelessly lost.\c\nI’ll check the direction it faces against my map,\nthen navigate through the cave with ease![VAR 0114(0075)]
I’ll look around for a Nosepass, too, but if you\ncatch one before I do, could you give it to me?[VAR 0114(0075)]
Hmm...now where might I find a Nosepass?\nIf you catch one, please give to me, OK?\c\nWait... Why do I feel like I’ve been here before...[VAR 0114(0075)]
Did you find a Nosepass for me?[VAR 0114(0075)]
Is this an alpha Nosepass?! Wow, I guess for\nsomeone as skilled as you, this is no big deal!\c\nNow, as I understand it, this Pokémon’s giant\nnose always points in the same direction...[VAR 0114(0075)]
That’s a Nosepass, all right! Thanks for finding it!\c\nNow, as I understand it, this Pokémon’s giant\nnose always points in the same direction...[VAR 0114(0075)]
So if it’s facing this way...[VAR 0114(0075)]
that means the exit must be over here![VAR 0114(0075)]
“A Nosepass never wanders”, indeed! I wish I’d\nencountered this Pokémon sooner![VAR 0114(0075)]
I owe you a big thanks. It’s such a relief to finally\nhave a Nosepass as my trusty guide!\c\nAll the twists and turns of Wayward Cave can’t\nstop me now![VAR 0114(0075)]

The color of your clothing can make all the\ndifference in the world, don’t you think?[VAR 0114(001D)]
You think?
Yeah!
Absolutely! I bet you would like to dress up in\nyour favorite color.[VAR 0114(001D)]
I knew you’d agree! You want to dress up in your\nfavorite color, don’t you?[VAR 0114(001D)]
I want to make clothing in new colors, but I can’t\nget ahold of the right materials.\c\nIf you happen to have Red Shards, Blue Shards,\nand Green Shards, would you kindly give me one\r\nof each?[VAR 0114(001D)]
When you can spare a Red Shard, Blue Shard,\nand Green Shard, would you kindly give me one\r\nof each?\c\nI hear you can find such shards in space-time\ndistortions.[VAR 0114(001D)]
Could you give me one Red Shard, one Blue\nShard, and one Green Shard?[VAR 0114(001D)]
[~ 8]
[~ 9]
Such beautiful shards... I’m sure these will\nwork perfectly.[VAR 0114(001D)]
Now then, let me try and dye something.[VAR 0114(001D)]
I can make anything into a beautiful dye if I cook\nit down in the trusty cauldron inside my shop![VAR 0114(001D)]
A color more beautiful than I even imagined...\nAnd all thanks to you, dear customer.[VAR 0114(001D)]

*sigh*\nWhat am I going to do...\c\nAt this rate I’ll make a real fool of myself in front\nof Conlan...[VAR 0114(0052)]
Eh? Oh, hello. You’re one of those kids from the\nSurvey Corps, right?[VAR 0114(0052)]
Ah! You might actually be just the person I need\nto help me out with a little research![VAR 0114(0052)]
My boy Conlan and I are planning to head to\nPrelude Beach at night to try and find the ghosts\r\nthat are rumored to haunt the place.\c\nBut ghosts scare the daylights out of me—errr...\nmy son! Yup! He’s terrified of ’em.[VAR 0114(0052)]
You’d think we could just not go, and call it a day.\nBut no, I’m afraid his little heart’s set on this.[VAR 0114(0052)]
But, er...you know. A fella can’t stay scared of\nghosts forever, right? It’s just too tragic.\r\nFor my boy, I mean...[VAR 0114(0052)]
So maybe if I study up on ghosts, I can find a way\nto help my boy conquer his fears.[VAR 0114(0052)]
If you’ve got any research data on spooky\nPokémon—Gastly would be a good one—I’d\r\nbe mighty grateful if you’d share it with me.[VAR 0114(0052)]
Let me know once you’ve learned any useful\ntidbits about Gastly. It’ll really help me...er...\r\nhelp my boy get over his fear of ghosts![VAR 0114(0052)]
Ooh! Gathered lots of data on Gastly, have you?\c\nLet’s see now... So it’s all recorded in this\nPokédex of yours? All right, then...[VAR 0114(0052)]
... ... ...\n... ... ...[VAR 0114(0052)]
Mushrooms, eh? Well, I’ll be.[VAR 0114(0052)]
It says here that Gastly likes to eat mushrooms,\nof all things! Not that that’s a bad thing, mind—\r\nit’s just a lot more tame than I was expecting.\c\nAnd here I was thinking that ghosts love nothing\nmore than to snack on unsuspecting humans...[VAR 0114(0052)]
You know, it’s funny—I’m actually rather partial to\na nice mushroom stew myself.\c\nMaybe Gastly aren’t so...ghastly after all![VAR 0114(0052)]
Hey, Dad! Watcha doin’ there?[VAR 0114(006A)]
Ack—Conlan![VAR 0114(0052)]
You talking ’bout work again? Don’t forget you\ngotta take a day off tomorrow!\c\nYou promised you’d take me to see the ghosties\nat Prelude Beach, remember?[VAR 0114(006A)]
O-of course your ol’ dad remembers, kiddo!\nAnd I’d never let work get in the way of our\r\nghost hunt. I’m really looking forward to it![VAR 0114(0052)]
Yaaay! I’m gonna catch a ghostie and show it\nto all my friends! Byeee—![VAR 0114(006A)]
... ... ...\n... ... ...[VAR 0114(0052)]
You know, he was just putting on a brave face\nbecause you were here.[VAR 0114(0052)]

You there! You seem like someone who enjoys\na bit of crafting! Do you think you could help\r\nme out with something?[VAR 0114(0050)]
I’d be very, VERY grateful if you’d try to craft\nsomething using a special recipe I came up with![VAR 0114(0050)]
So, without further ado, here’s the recipe![VAR 0114(0050)]
[~ 3]
This is the recipe for what I’ve named\nPokéshi Dolls!\c\nI invented them, you see, as special items that\nwe could make in this village. I would love to\r\nhave you craft one and show it to me.\c\nI’m looking forward to seeing what you come\nup with![VAR 0114(0050)]
Please come show me once you make a\nPokéshi Doll!\c\nAnyway...[VAR 0114(0050)]
Hmmm? What’s this?!\c\nWhy, that’s a Pokéshi Doll if I ever saw one!\nPlease, let me have a closer look![VAR 0114(0050)]
Amazing! Just look how smoothly you’ve carved\nthese curves!\c\nYour attentive carving shows you put love and\ncare into your handiwork![VAR 0114(0050)]
And these colors! You’ve definitely given it a\nvivid look, that’s for sure!\c\nYes, these hues must be the very shades of your\ninner strength and passion![VAR 0114(0050)]
Not to mention, this Pokéshi Doll is perfectly\nbalanced! At a glance, you’d think it’s sure to\r\nfall over, and yet it stubbornly remains upright![VAR 0114(0050)]
...Whew.\c\nThank you. I’ve savored your Pokéshi Doll to my\nheart’s content.[VAR 0114(0050)]
We used the same recipe, and yet your Pokéshi\nDoll had a completely different feel than mine.[VAR 0114(0050)]
Here, I’ll give you a Pokéshi Doll I made. I took\ngreat care in crafting it, so have a look, and see\r\nhow it differs from the one you made![VAR 0114(0050)]
Please make more and more of these delightful\nPokéshi Dolls!

Ah, you’re part of the Galaxy Team!\nI’ve been waiting![VAR 0114(0081)]
I came here since I heard you all were planning to\nset up a camp.[VAR 0114(0081)]
But it seems not much progress has been made,\nsince that Bronzor is getting in the way.[VAR 0114(0081)]
It’s not belligerent, but it seems like it wants\nsomething, so we can’t just ignore it either...[VAR 0114(0081)]
Please, do you think you could find out what it\nis Bronzor wants?[VAR 0114(0081)]
Bronzor seems like it’s trying to tell us something.\nTry and find out what that is.[VAR 0114(0081)]
Zor!
Is there something over that way...?
Zooor...
Zozor!
Zooor...
I saw Bronzor go flying off in this direction\nall of a sudden...[VAR 0114(0081)]
What in the— That Bronzor! It’s wounded![VAR 0114(0081)]
This is no good at all! Here, I’ll fix it right up.[VAR 0114(0081)]
There, that should do it! Bronzor should be fit as\na fiddle now.[VAR 0114(0081)]
Zooor!
Zozor!
Seems the Bronzor at the new campsite was\nlooking for its friend this whole time.\c\nI’m glad you looked into it. Otherwise, we may\nhave been too late to treat this Bronzor![VAR 0114(0081)]
This land is dangerous, even for the Pokémon\nthat call it their home.\c\nIt may be wise to be extra prepared as you\nexplore this area.\c\nI’ll be sure to keep a fine lineup of wares stocked\nfor you, so please buy anything that you need![VAR 0114(0081)]
Ah, and it seems the base camp has been all\nset up while we were talking! In which case,\r\nI should get settled in as well. So long![VAR 0114(0081)]
Those Bronzor really do seem jolly keen on our\nnew base camp, eh?\c\nThey don’t flee or attack as one might expect...\nHow wonderfully mysterious![VAR 0114(0005)]

Back where I came from, Clefairy would come\nout and dance on nights with a full moon.\c\nI’ve heard there are Clefairy in Hisui, and\nso I was wondering if they dance here, too.[VAR 0114(003E)]
I’ve heard you can find Clefairy at the\nFabled Spring.\c\nCould you go and find out if Clefairy dance\nhere in the Hisui region?[VAR 0114(003E)]
Pi! Pi!

Piii?!
You should let Astair know that the Clefairy of\nHisui do indeed dance.
Come back when the full moon is out.
You can’t see the moon in this weather!
Oho! So you say that Clefairy dance here in the\nland of Hisui, too![VAR 0114(003E)]
They must have been adorable to behold. I must\ngo and see them one of these days.[VAR 0114(003E)]

Not really
I see... Well, I have the duty of making this village\nmore fashionable, too.\c\nLet us study fashion together![VAR 0114(001D)]
If that’s the case, then we should study fashion\ntogether. I’m sure your interest will grow in\r\nno time![VAR 0114(001D)]
You’re part of the Survey Corps, am I right?\nPlease, I ask that you lend me your talents.\c\nI’ve been told that Hippopotas, which can be\nfound around the Crimson Mirelands, have\r\ndifferent appearances based on their gender.[VAR 0114(001D)]
I feel like if I were able to see and compare\nthem, it would inspire me to create new designs\r\nfor my clothing!\c\nPlease, could you show me both a male and a\nfemale Hippopotas?[VAR 0114(001D)]
Please, could you show me both a male and\na female Hippopotas?[VAR 0114(001D)]
Could you show me a male Hippopotas, then?[VAR 0114(001D)]
Next, I’d like to see a female Hippopotas.[VAR 0114(001D)]
Wah![VAR 0114(001D)]
Such a presence... Is this what they call an alpha?\nYou must be skilled to be able to catch one![VAR 0114(001D)]
I never thought just a change in color would\nlead to such a different impression for the\r\nsame Pokémon...[VAR 0114(001D)]

Every time I’m in trouble, you turn up—just like\nclockwork. That’s right—Wanda’s missing again!\r\nPlease! Help me find my lost sister![VAR 0114(0091)]
This time she was sent to the Coronet Highlands,\nbut she never returned from that trip![VAR 0114(0091)]
But I’ve got faith! I know you and that Ursaluna\nwill be able to track her down for me.\c\nGet a whiff of that old kerchief, and see if you\ncan find any traces of her, please![VAR 0114(0091)]

Wanda should be somewhere up in the Coronet\nHighlands, so please find her![VAR 0114(0091)]
Wanda was sent to the Coronet Highlands, but\nshe never returned from that trip!\c\nPlease use Ursaluna’s tracking skills to find her\nwherever she is out there.[VAR 0114(0091)]

Though it’s a little embarrassing, I guess, to admit\nto myself that I need to rely on you...[VAR 0114(0070)]
Oh, you know what?\c\nI used to think that Sneasler was a mean\nPokémon, since it looks sly and unsavory, but...\c\nIt helped me out of a real tight spot, so I guess\nit must be good at heart after all![VAR 0114(0070)]
Thanks again for helping me off that mountain,\nmy trusty teammate [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nYou know, I meant it—you’d be well suited to the\nSecurity Corps! Ever consider joining up?[VAR 0114(0070)]
It seems as if there’s nothing you can’t find!\c\nI’m always thanking you, but thanks again.\nThere’s simply no doubting your abilities![VAR 0114(0091)]
And I heard from Wanda how you reassured her,\ntelling her you’re teammates and all. She’s even\r\nstarted calling you her savior!\c\nIt really means a lot to her to be accepted by\nsomeone like you. And as her big brother, I\r\nappreciate you keeping her safe too, of course.[VAR 0114(0091)]

N-nooooooo!\c\nThey got me with their Stun Spore, and my legs\nwon’t listen to me! Don’t leave me here, savior![VAR 0114(0070)]
You have no Pokémon that can battle. Better\nregroup and come back prepared.
Th-th-THANK YOU! I swear I’d never survive here\nin Hisui without you as a teammate![VAR 0114(0070)]
I came to patrol because I know some of the\nvillagers come out here to hunt for mushrooms.\c\nWhile keeping an eye out for them, I ended up\nhunting around a bit myself for some finds...\r\nbut the mushrooms ended up hunting m-me...\c\nI guess my brother is probably a mess worrying\nabout me again, huh?[VAR 0114(0070)]
But you’re so good at battling... Probably even\nbetter suited to the Security Corps than I am![VAR 0114(0070)]
You sure you don’t want to join our corps, savior?\nI really think you’d fit right in.[VAR 0114(0070)]
Thank you for saving Wanda yet again! I’m so\nglad we’ve got the Survey Corps to rely on.[VAR 0114(0091)]
I was chilled to my marrow when I heard my sister\nwas caught up in a Pokémon attack this time...\c\nIf only she could just get herself assigned to\npatrolling the village for a while, nice and safe...[VAR 0114(0091)]

Ah, Sand Radishes! The Alabaster Icelands’\nfinest feature!\c\nIf you give these bitter roots a nice, thorough\npickling, it brings out a unique sweetness!\c\nOnce they’re pickled, they make for a lovely,\ncrisp, and quite well-liked snack![VAR 0114(0021)]
My granddaughter makes a fine pickle, I tell you\nwhat. Perhaps I’ll ask her to give one of these a\r\nnice briny soak.[VAR 0114(0021)]
Anyway, I’m sorry to have kept on using you as a\ngo-between with Choy. I suppose it’s time I had\r\na proper conversation with the whelp.[VAR 0114(0021)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Now listen—I’ll set you up with some new goods,\nbut as a favor to [VAR 0189(0000)]—\r\nnot you!\c\nDon’t think for one second this means I’ve\naccepted you![VAR 0114(0021)]
But Tao Hua, sir—[VAR 0114(001C)]
Oh, please, grandpa! I can’t believe this is still an\nissue for you![VAR 0114(008B)]
Yui! How long have you been—?![VAR 0114(0021)]
What—is our little store not worthy to sell your\ngoods? Talk about letting personal feelings get\r\nin the way of your business!\c\nIf you keep this up, grandpa, I swear I’ll never\nspeak to you again![VAR 0114(008B)]
Guuuh! But why, sweet Yui?! You swore you’d\nnever get married and leave your poor gramps![VAR 0114(0021)]
Who in their right mind takes a tiny child’s\nwords so seriously...?[VAR 0114(008B)]
I’m so sorry my grandpa has been such a bother\nto you, [VAR 0189(0000)].\r\nI hope this doesn’t put you off visiting our shop.[VAR 0114(008B)]
Well...in any case, we’ve got excellent new items\non our shelves. Do buy some![VAR 0114(001C)]
Yui’s my granddaughter, you hear? My dear,\nsweet granddaughter! I raised her myself, and I’d\r\nsooner be eaten by a Pokémon than accept that\r\nshe’s been married to some whelp![VAR 0114(0021)]

Hmmm... No, that’s not right, either. It needs a\nspecial extra something, but what...?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Oh! Nice timing as always![VAR 0114(0012)]
I could use your help again coming up with some\nnew hairstyles. I’ve hit another wall here![VAR 0114(0012)]
Now, I bet I could get inspiration from a different\nPokémon this time. A Pokémon like...yeah, Kirlia![VAR 0114(0012)]
I can’t remember how it looks exactly, but I’m\npretty sure it has a real distinct style.\c\nIf I could study one up nice and close, I bet it’d\nget me past this block![VAR 0114(0012)]
If you manage to catch a Kirlia, bring it here so I\ncan have a look, ’K?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Kirlia... Hrmm...\nNow what exactly did Kirlia look like again...?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Oh! Didja get that Kirlia to show me?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Come on—even you must be hurting for some\nnew hairstyles, right? Get me that Kirlia![VAR 0114(0012)]
Wow! This is an alpha Pokémon, isn’t it?!\c\nJust think—if an alpha Kirlia waltzed into the\nhairdresser and asked for a cut ’n’ dry, where\r\nwould you even begin, huh?[VAR 0114(0012)]
You know, they say Kirlia just loves to dance.\c\nI kinda get it—that feeling when your hair sways\naround you while you’re dancing... It’s the best!\c\nActually, yeah... That’s the sort of hairstyle I want\nto go for!\c\nNow, how to gather up the hair the right way?\nAnd where should it be let down? Hmmm...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Oh! I’ve got it! That’s what I’ll do![VAR 0114(0012)]
[VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]BoyGirl, I owe you one. Thanks to you and Kirlia,\nI’ve got ideas for some new hairstyles—and new\r\ncolors—like no one’s ever seen![VAR 0114(0012)]
Come by anytime and try ’em out for yourself![VAR 0114(0012)]

I’ve come up with the perfect pickle recipe\nthanks to Geodude.[VAR 0114(002B)]
Aren’t you curious?[VAR 0114(002B)]
You bet I am!
Not really...
Tell you what, my dear—help me gather the\ningredients, and I’ll teach you the recipe!\c\nI’ll need two hunks of Crunchy Salt, two pods of\nPlump Beans, and two bunches of King’s Leaf.[VAR 0114(002B)]
Oh, come now—don’t be such a spoilsport!\nHelp me gather the ingredients, won’t you?\c\nI need two hunks of Crunchy Salt, two pods of\nPlump Beans, and two bunches of King’s Leaf.[VAR 0114(002B)]
You want that perfect pickle recipe, don’t you?\c\nThen I need two hunks of Crunchy Salt, two pods\nof Plump Beans, and two bunches of King’s Leaf.[VAR 0114(002B)]
Do you want to make a perfect batch of pickles?\nIt’ll use up two hunks of Crunchy Salt, two pods\r\nof Plump Beans, and two bunches of King’s Leaf.[VAR 0114(002B)]
Let’s get pickling!
[~ 9]
Oh, OK... Well, let me know once you’re ready\nand able to start pickling.[VAR 0114(002B)]
Lovely! I already have the Sand Radishes I need,\nso let’s get pickling![VAR 0114(002B)]
[~ 12]
Now for the final step—all we need to do is place\nGeodude on top of the pot, and it’s done![VAR 0114(002B)]
What in the world?![VAR 0114(002B)]
Graaaaaav!
Gosh! Geodude changed shape!\c\nIs this that “Evolution” business I’ve heard people\ntalk about?[VAR 0114(002B)]
And what about the pickles?![VAR 0114(002B)]
Oh my. This is twice as good as I expected!\nI’ll call it...the Twice-Spiced Radish! It truly is\r\nthe perfect pickle dish.[VAR 0114(002B)]
Why, with the help of Pokémon, there’s no limits\nto what a cook can accomplish! Thank you so\r\nmuch for helping me out![VAR 0114(002B)]

Glad to see you all the way out here! I’ve been\nwaiting patiently with a request.\c\nWhat say you to a spot of mushroom hunting...\nin the snow![VAR 0114(002E)]
The Pearl Clan told me that the ’shrooms growing\naround Heart’s Crag are quite the delicacy.\c\nBut these little gems are buried in the snow, and\nonly a Swinub’s nose can snuffle them out![VAR 0114(002E)]
This is where your skills come in. Catch yourself a\nSwinub, take it out foraging, and see if you can\r\nfind those mushrooms! Three would be great![VAR 0114(002E)]
Three mushrooms is all I need!\c\nHave a Swinub accompany you around Heart’s\nCrag and snuffle them out from under the snow.[VAR 0114(002E)]
Two mushrooms left now!\c\nHave a Swinub accompany you around Heart’s\nCrag and snuffle them out from under the snow.[VAR 0114(002E)]
Only one mushroom left!\c\nHave a Swinub accompany you around Heart’s\nCrag and snuffle it out from under the snow.[VAR 0114(002E)]
Sweee![VAR 0114(00EA)]
Swinub is making some noise... Is there something\nbeneath the snow?
Oho! Found one, did you? A fine mushroom\nindeed—well done![VAR 0114(002E)]
Wow, you and Swinub snuffled this one out quick!\nI just knew you were the right person for the job.[VAR 0114(002E)]
You have no Pokémon that can battle. Better\nregroup and come back prepared.
Gosh, I thought you were slacking off, wasting\ntime with that Pokémon battle! But look at this\r\nsplendid specimen of a mushroom you’ve found!\c\nYou’re a natural at this foraging stuff, you know.[VAR 0114(002E)]
Swinub is reacting to the mushroom that Snover\nis holding.
Fantastic effort all around!\c\nYou and Swinub did a great job tracking down\nthose three mushrooms I was after![VAR 0114(002E)]
It sure was fun foraging with you both. Pokémon\nand people together make for a great team!\c\nI can’t wait to forage with you elsewhere—\nperhaps with a new Pokémon pal along to help![VAR 0114(002E)]
It’ll be hard to top Swinub, though... Its snuffling\nskills may well be the best out there!\c\nThinking about it, it was a Swinub that discovered\nthe hot spring in the Pearl Settlement, too...[VAR 0114(002E)]
Maybe I should really just partner up with a\nSwinub, huh? Morel and Swinub: the mushroom-\r\nhunting dream duo! Sounds good, doesn’t it?[VAR 0114(002E)]

Ah, if it isn’t one of our beloved customers.\c\nMight I trouble you to help me with a little\nsurvey work?[VAR 0114(0035)]
In my family, we’ve always passed down tales of\nsome ancestor that lived in a village around the\r\nAvalanche Slopes. But I’ve never been able to\r\nfind any hint of such a settlement ever existing.\c\nI’m beginning to doubt the tales are true.[VAR 0114(0035)]
But everyone wants to know about where they\ncame from, don’t they?\c\nSo help me out. See if you can find any evidence\npeople ever lived around the Avalanche Slopes.[VAR 0114(0035)]
I’m still hoping you’ll find me some evidence that\npeople used to live around the Avalanche Slopes.[VAR 0114(0035)]
“February 5”\c\n“I was on my way back to the village when a\nblizzard blew in. I decided to take refuge for\r\nthe night in one of the mountain huts.
“I awoke at dawn due to some noise. Before me\nstood a ... ...arbed in a fine kimono...
“Our eyes met, and ... beauty stole the breath\nfro... my breast—yet it ...s a terrible beauty,\r\nfrighten... to behold.
“I cl...d my eyes in terror, waiting for th...\nto move on and lea... me in peace.
“When ...ext I opened my eyes, the... had\ndisappea... ...eaving behind nothi... but the\r\ndriven s...”
...The rest of the pages are missing.
You should regroup and come back later to\ntry again!
Froslass seems to have dropped something...
It’s a bundle of pages without any cover...\c\nIt looks like they would fit into the gap in the\njournal that you found earlier.
The rest of the pages seem to detail the writer’s\nlife in a village, which sounds like it might have\r\nbeen in the Alabaster Icelands.
“September 1”\c\n“It’s hard to believe it’s been ... years now since\n...and I began living together in the ...lage.\c\n“I was flipp... through my old journal entries\ntoday and ...ppened to be reminded of th...\r\n...I met once...”
“In an odd way... reminds me of the... that\nI met that day...\c\n“But I remind myself th... I live in the real world,\nnot in a ...rld of old fairy tales. Surely such\r\nthings c... be true...”
“January 3”\c\n“Why did I do it? Why d... I have to remember\nthat ...? Why speak of ... to my dear ...?\r\nI regret so m... ...t it’s too late for reg... now...

That was the last entry in the journal.
You’d better return to Jubilife Village and show\nthe old journal to the merchant, Mani.
[~ 20]
Did you find any trace of a settlement that might\nonce have been around the Avalanche Slopes?[VAR 0114(0035)]
You root around in your satchel, but you can’t\nseem to find the old journal you’d picked up...
What? You say you found an old journal but\nnow it’s gone? And you got it from...a Pokémon?\c\nWell, don’t leave me in suspense! What in the\nworld did it say?[VAR 0114(0035)]
That lines up exactly with the stories I heard from\nmy old gran about the village...[VAR 0114(0035)]
Which means that it’s true! My ancestors really\ndid come from a village that once existed there![VAR 0114(0035)]
You have no idea how many years I’ve wondered\nif I could believe those old tales or not.\c\nI really owe you a great deal for looking into this\nfor me and clearing up my doubts.[VAR 0114(0035)]
But you still have to wonder...\c\nWhy would a Pokémon be carrying an old journal\nthat once belonged to a human?[VAR 0114(0035)]
And you say it disappeared? I almost wonder if,\nsomehow, it returned to that Pokémon again...[VAR 0114(0035)]

I’m telling you, Burmy is the Pokémon with a\ncloak made of leaves![VAR 0114(0042)]
No, no, Burmy cloaks are made of minerals like\nsand and rock—I’m quite sure of it.[VAR 0114(0066)]
Ha! If it ain’t covered in trash, it ain’t a Burmy![VAR 0114(004E)]
Haaah... This conversation is getting us nowhere.\c\nAre you both sure you’ve actually seen a Burmy\nbefore? It wasn’t some other Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0042)]
We might ask you the same thing.[VAR 0114(0066)]
I’ve seen Burmy here in Hisui, and I’ve seen ’em\nback in my own region too. And guess what...?\r\nThey’re all covered in trash![VAR 0114(004E)]
Oh my. You must have gotten confused somehow,\nmy dear.[VAR 0114(0066)]
Please, both of you! We’re just repeating the\nsame arguments over and over at this point...[VAR 0114(0042)]
Hey, you’re from the Survey Corps, aren’t you?\c\nWe could figure out which of us is right pretty\nquick if someone brought us an actual Burmy.\r\nCatch one and come show it to us, would you?[VAR 0114(0042)]
Could you try to catch both the so-called Burmy\nthat my companions here were talking about?[VAR 0114(0042)]
Have you brought a Burmy to show us?\nYou know, the Pokémon covered in leaves?[VAR 0114(0042)]
Burmy is the Pokémon with a cloak made of\nleaves. Once these two see it, they’ll have to\r\nadmit I was right all along.[VAR 0114(0042)]
No... This isn’t the Burmy I’m familiar with.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Yup, this is a Burmy, all right![VAR 0114(0042)]
It’s similar, dear, I’ll grant you that. But this must\nbe a different species.[VAR 0114(0066)]
Yeah, I ain’t buyin’ it. This ain’t a Burmy.[VAR 0114(004E)]
... ... ...\n... ... ...
Well...if the real deal can’t convince these two,\nI guess we’ll need to look at the fake Burmy too.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Well, we’ve all seen each other’s supposed\nreal Burmy...\c\nBut we’re no closer to agreeing on anything.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Nothing else for it. Let’s have Professor Laventon\ndecide. The Burmy he chooses to put in the\r\nPokédex will be considered the real Burmy!\c\nOnce you complete Burmy’s Pokédex entry,\ncome back and show us what it says, will you?[VAR 0114(0042)]
Can you carry on until you’ve brought both the\nBurmy look-alikes these two spoke of, my dear?[VAR 0114(0066)]
Have you brought a Burmy to show us? It should\nhave minerals stuck all over it, mind you![VAR 0114(0066)]
Burmy is the Pokémon with a cloak made of\nsand, rock, and other minerals!\c\nSeeing is believing, young researcher, so please\nbring us a Burmy to put our dispute to rest.[VAR 0114(0066)]
Hm. The Burmy I know is different from this one.[VAR 0114(0066)]
Take a good look, both of you! This little one is\nthe real Burmy.[VAR 0114(0066)]
Errr. I guess it looks pretty similar. But there’s\nno way this is a Burmy.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Yeah, I gotta agree. Where’s its trash at, huh?[VAR 0114(004E)]
Honestly, how can someone still be in doubt\nafter seeing a real Burmy right up close?\c\nI suppose we’ll need to compare it to those false\nBurmy to prove the point.[VAR 0114(0066)]
Hey, survey g[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]uyal. Be a sport and bring us both\nthose wannabe Burmy as well, would ya?[VAR 0114(004E)]
You got that Burmy yet? The trash-covered one?[VAR 0114(004E)]
Burmy cover themselves in trash, ain’t no two ways\nabout it! Find one and bring it here, would ya?[VAR 0114(004E)]
What’s the deal here? This ain’t the Burmy I know![VAR 0114(004E)]
Oh! Now that’s a Burmy, and no mistake![VAR 0114(004E)]
Huh? I don’t know about that...[VAR 0114(0042)]
Indeed. This Pokémon is no Burmy.[VAR 0114(0066)]
These two ain’t gonna admit this is the real Burmy.\nLooks like we’ll just hafta line it up with both the\r\nfake ones too![VAR 0114(004E)]
Burmy is the Pokémon cloaked in leaves. I look\nforward to seeing its completed Pokédex entry![VAR 0114(0042)]
Burmy is the Pokémon with a cloak made of\nsand, rocks, and other minerals, lest you forget.\c\nPlease look into it for us![VAR 0114(0066)]
Burmy’s the Pokémon caked in trash! The ones\nfrom my region were all like that too, so...yeah.[VAR 0114(004E)]
I see you completed your Pokédex entry for\nBurmy! Let’s have a look.[VAR 0114(0042)]
So that’s how it is... It seems all our Burmy are\nindeed, well...Burmy! All three of them![VAR 0114(0042)]
So you’re saying that Pokémon of the same\nspecies can come in forms as different as these?\r\nHow incredible![VAR 0114(0066)]
I guess that means...we were all in the right?\nLooks like we wasted our breath arguin’.\c\nGeez, well, I’m sorry I was so harsh to both o’ ya.[VAR 0114(004E)]
No, no, I’m just as much at fault.\c\nBut really, this whole escapade has taught us a lot\nabout Pokémon! I’m truly glad.[VAR 0114(0066)]
I apologize for getting a little heated back there\ntoo... But it all turned out well in the end.[VAR 0114(0042)]
And sorry for getting you caught up in our mess!\nYou did a great job clearing up our confusion.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Now then, I’m feeling fired up to learn even\nmore about Pokémon! If you find any other\r\ncurious Pokémon, we’d love to hear about them.[VAR 0114(0042)]

I’ve been waiting for you, Survey Corps recruit.\c\nI want to give my thanks to a certain Blissey that\naided me when I was left injured by a wild\r\nPokémon. Help me find it, would you?[VAR 0114(0099)]
It was a wild Pokémon that hurt me, and it was a\nwild Pokémon that helped me...\r\nIt’s a curious world we live in, wouldn’t you say?\c\nBut even to a Pokémon, one must always give\nthanks for the care one receives. I’d be the shame\r\nof my corps if I failed to do even that much.[VAR 0114(0099)]
Join me at Avalugg’s Legacy, here in the Alabaster\nIcelands. That’s where I met that Blissey.[VAR 0114(0099)]
So you’ve come to help me search out Blissey,\nhave you? It was around here that I met it, but\r\nI don’t see it now...[VAR 0114(0099)]
When did you meet it?
How did you meet it?
Now, let me think... As I recall, when I’d been out\nhere for a little while, I simply turned around—\r\nand there was an Abomasnow![VAR 0114(0099)]
Snooowwwrrr!
You must defeat that Abomasnow in battle!\c\nSo that we can find Blissey...and so that no one\nelse from the team might be attacked like I was![VAR 0114(0099)]
Now, hold on right there! What can your\nPokémon do for you all battered and weary?\r\nGive me a moment, and I’ll take care of [VAR 1101(00FD,0402)]itthem.[VAR 0114(0099)]
Now! To battle![VAR 0114(0099)]
It’s quite as I thought—Blissey may be one thing,\nbut other Pokémon are still terrifying...[VAR 0114(0099)]
Ow! Oooh, and it seems I managed to twist my\nankle in all the excitement...[VAR 0114(0099)]
Bliss!
Wha— Blissey?![VAR 0114(0099)]
Well, this is a bit of fortune in misfortune!\c\nI brought these Berries to thank you for your\nhelp before, Blissey. Here you go.[VAR 0114(0099)]
Blisseee!
Snooow...
Blissey is terribly kind, isn’t it?\c\nIt treats anyone who needs its help, be they\nhuman or Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0099)]

Sure, what is it?
What kind of favor?
Don’t worry. It’s very simple.[VAR 0114(0020)]
Could you bring me a hundred Medicinal Leeks?[VAR 0114(0020)]
What?!
A hundred?!
These leeks are well-known for growing\npractically all over the region. They’re also\r\ncalled wayfarer’s friends.\c\nKnowing you, I bet you could gather a hundred\nof them in your sleep![VAR 0114(0020)]
Once you have a hundred Medicinal Leeks you\ncan spare for me, please do bring them on by![VAR 0114(0020)]
I see you’ve gathered a hundred leeks! Will you\ngive them to me?[VAR 0114(0020)]
Ah, what fine leeks![VAR 0114(0020)]
This will be enough to make plenty of medicine.\nI’m always running out, what with our constant\r\nstream of injured colleagues...[VAR 0114(0020)]
This way, the Medical Corps can prepare a nice\nstock for the folks who can’t craft their own\r\nmedicines like you can.[VAR 0114(0020)]
Though I must say, we’ve had fewer injuries to\ntreat as your Pokémon research has progressed.\r\nQuite an achievement on your corps’ part, right?[VAR 0114(0020)]

I came to set up another base camp, but I don’t\nspy Craig from the Construction Corps...[VAR 0114(0076)]
I told him to meet me near the base of the falls\nhere in the Alabaster Icelands, so where is he?[VAR 0114(0076)]
He’s not the type to usually get lost, so I’m\nhonestly a bit worried...\c\nDo me a favor? Would you find Craig for me?[VAR 0114(0076)]
I told Craig to meet me here at the base of the\nfalls, but there’s no sign of him anywhere...\c\nI wonder where in the world he could be.\nHe’s not the type to get lost...[VAR 0114(0076)]

He’s the one who told me to meet him at the\nbase of the falls, and yet he hasn’t shown.[VAR 0114(008A)]

I’m glad I had you around to help, or I might’ve\nbeen waiting here till I turned into a block of ice!\r\nNow let’s get that camp up and running![VAR 0114(008A)]

Goodness, I don’t know how the Pokémon living\nin this frigid place find the energy to dash about\r\nas they do...\c\nDo they have a nice layer of insulating fat,\nperhaps...? There must be some trick to it![VAR 0114(0005)]

Ah, just the person I’ve been waiting for!\c\nMy Keokeo wandered off to go play, but they\nhaven’t come back yet. Do you think you could\r\nhelp me find them?[VAR 0114(009B)]
Keokeo?
You mean Vulpix?
Oh, I’m sorry. Back home in Alola, Vulpix were\ncalled Keokeo, you see.[VAR 0114(009B)]
Hm...? Oh, did you not go to play with the rest?[VAR 0114(009B)]
This is what an Alolan Vulpix looks like.\c\nThey blend right into the snow with their white\nfur, so trying to find them all just by myself would\r\ntake ages. And I’m still missing five of them...[VAR 0114(009B)]
You should be able to find my Vulpix playing\naround the Avalanche Slopes. Could you find\r\nthem all and tell them to come back?[VAR 0114(009B)]
Keon!
Keeen!
Kon!
Ken?
Keokeo!
Ken ken!
The Vulpix ran off toward the Snowfields Camp.
Thanks for helping me search for them. They’re\nall back, safe and sound.[VAR 0114(009B)]
Oh! This one seems to have taken a liking to you.[VAR 0114(009B)]
If it’s all right with you, could you take this little\none with you? I’m certain it’ll help with your\r\nsurvey work![VAR 0114(009B)]
We’ll be here at the Snowfields Camp for a while.\nI’d love it if you’d stop by from time to time and\r\nshow me how Vulpix is doing.[VAR 0114(009B)]
You don’t have any space on your team.
Just let me know once you’re ready to take\nVulpix with you.[VAR 0114(009B)]
You’re taking Vulpix with you now? Have fun out\nthere, Vulpix![VAR 0114(009B)]

It’s so cold, I can’t even feel my fingers...\nI can’t work like this![VAR 0114(0076)]
I just want to earn my way up through the ranks!\c\nBut to do that, I’ve got to at least warm myself\nup enough to feel my fingers...[VAR 0114(0076)]
Do you think you could bring me a Pokémon\nthat’s good at manipulating flames? Then it could\r\nkeep our fire roaring for me.[VAR 0114(0076)]
I’m really having a hard time keeping the fire\nburning just right—maybe because of the cold?\r\nAnyway, I need a Pokémon good with flames![VAR 0114(0076)]
Did you bring me a Fire-type Pokémon that\ncan keep these flames roaring?[VAR 0114(0076)]
If you find a Fire-type Pokémon that’d be perfect\nfor turning up the heat on our fire, let me know![VAR 0114(0076)]
I’m already feeling much warmer, thanks to this\nPokémon of yours. Now I can focus on my work![VAR 0114(0076)]
Though...now that I’m so warm and comfortable,\nI seem to...*yawn*...find my eyelids drooping...[VAR 0114(0076)]
Just...just a... Zzz...[VAR 0114(0076)]
Gahk! N-no! I wasn’t sleeping! I swear![VAR 0114(0076)]
Now that’s some real firepower!\c\nIf I can use the power of a real alpha Pokémon,\nthis fire’ll burn brighter than anything![VAR 0114(0076)]

You’re with the Survey Corps, right?\c\nA Chimecho’s decided to nest in my house.\nDo you think you could help me get it to move?[VAR 0114(0058)]
It made itself at home under the eaves before\nI even noticed.\c\nIt seems mellow enough, but I’m not at ease with\nhaving a Pokémon so close...[VAR 0114(0058)]
I’ve already spoken to some homeowners who’d\nbe willing to let Chimecho move in with them.\c\nWhat I’d like you to do is have a look at the\nhomes and make sure they’d be a good fit\r\nfor Chimecho.\c\nIt’s not like I can tell what Chimecho feels, so...[VAR 0114(0058)]
The first place I’d like you to check is that\nfarmer’s house near the fields. Think you could\r\nfind a nice place for Chimecho to hang there?[VAR 0114(0058)]
You found a place that Chimecho could\nhang from.
Chiiiiiime...
The wind direction seems to be\nbothering Chimecho.
Oh... So it prefers the way the wind blows around\nmy house? I like it, too! We get a good breeze![VAR 0114(0058)]
Chime!
Well then, how about a hut by the sea? The\nocean breeze is so refreshing.[VAR 0114(0058)]
Chiiiiiime...
Chimecho seems lonely since there’s\nnobody around...
So it likes lively places! It’s always great to have\nsome activity around.[VAR 0114(0058)]
How about the training grounds?\c\nWith the Security Corps around, that place is\nalways bustling![VAR 0114(0058)]
Chime! Chiiime!
Is that your Chimecho? Why don’t you come and\ntrain with us?
Chiii?!
It seems like Chimecho doesn’t like to battle...
I guess it’s only natural that some Pokémon don’t\nlike to battle. I’m sorry to scare you, Chimecho.[VAR 0114(0058)]
Chi-i-i-i-i-me!
Oh, is it telling me to not worry about it?[VAR 0114(0058)]
How about next door to me, then? It’s hardly\ndifferent at all from my place.\c\nI just had a chat with my neighbors, and they said\nthey’d be fine with Chimecho hanging around![VAR 0114(0058)]
Chime...
Uh, pardon me...[VAR 0114(0058)]
I know I just sent you chasing about looking for\na good home for Chimecho, but...\c\nI think I’d like it to stay with me, after all.[VAR 0114(0058)]
You’ve really helped me understand Chimecho\na lot better, and I think we can actually live\r\ntogether now.[VAR 0114(0058)]
It just dawned on me that hearing its adorable\ncry coming from under the eaves is part of my\r\nroutine now![VAR 0114(0058)]
Chime! Chiiime!
You’re going to live with me from now on,\naren’t you, Chimecho?[VAR 0114(0058)]
Thank you for all your help. I’m glad this village\nhas the Survey Corps![VAR 0114(0058)]

Hey, you’re a member of the Galaxy Team’s Survey\nCorps, right? I’ve heard you’re studying Pokémon\r\nand making some kind of book about them.[VAR 0114(00C8)]
Does that mean you’re also studying my dear,\nbeloved Bergmite?[VAR 0114(00C8)]
Of course![VAR 0114(00C8)]
Sure, I guess...[VAR 0114(00C8)]
What?! I can’t allow that!\c\nThat means you’ll know more about Bergmite\nthan I do, right?![VAR 0114(00C8)]
What a lukewarm answer!\c\nYou should be more passionate! Do a proper job,\nwon’t you?[VAR 0114(00C8)]
I’m absolutely convinced that nobody loves or\nunderstands Bergmite more than I do![VAR 0114(00C8)]
Once you’ve completed its entry in your book,\ncome show it to me.\c\nAs Bergmite’s number-one fan in all of Hisui,\nI’ll make sure you haven’t missed any details![VAR 0114(00C8)]
Come show me Bergmite’s entry when it’s done.\nNot that I think you’ll be able to find anything\r\nabout Bergmite that I don’t already know.[VAR 0114(00C8)]
You completed Bergmite’s entry?![VAR 0114(00C8)]
Oooh, what to do... I want to look, but then I\ndon’t want to look, and... Fine, I’ll have a look![VAR 0114(00C8)]
Huh... I see...\n... ... ...\r\nNo way, really?!\c\n... ... ...\nWow, I didn’t know that...[VAR 0114(00C8)]
You did a good job. I particularly liked how you\nmade a note of Bergmite’s height and weight.\c\nThis entry shows that you took the time to get\nto know many Bergmite and studied them with\r\na passion.[VAR 0114(00C8)]
I mean, I knew everything you wrote already,\nof course![VAR 0114(00C8)]
Wh-what?! It’s true!\c\nI’m the one who knows all there is to know about\nBergmite, after all![VAR 0114(00C8)]
But I did really enjoy reading the entry you made\nabout Bergmite.\c\nIts entry in your book might be complete, but I\nhope you spend more time studying Bergmite![VAR 0114(00C8)]

Wanda snuck out of the village without telling\nme, and she hasn’t come back!\c\nI heard she was all bundled up against the cold,\ntoo, so I’ve got this sneaking suspicion she went\r\nto the Alabaster Icelands.[VAR 0114(0091)]
Whatever sent her out there, it doesn’t seem like\nit was an assignment from the Security Corps.\c\nBut what else could make her want to go to such\na dangerous place alone?[VAR 0114(0091)]
I really need some help again from you and\nthat Ursaluna!\c\nUse the scent from the scraps of Wanda’s old\nkerchief, and search her out for me![VAR 0114(0091)]
And this time I’ll go look for her myself, as well!\c\nI can’t just stand by and rely on you every time.\nI’m her big brother! I can’t let her down now![VAR 0114(0091)]
Wait for me, Wanda! I’ll save you this time![VAR 0114(0091)]

W-we’ve got to go find him at once! Please,\nsavior, you’ve got to help me one more time![VAR 0114(0070)]
We’ll use my brother’s sweaty old kerchief\nso that Ursaluna can learn his scent!\c\nSo let’s hurry to the Alabaster Icelands and save\nmy hopeless brother before it’s too late![VAR 0114(0070)]
O-oh! You! C-can you and Sneasler get me back\nup there?![VAR 0114(0091)]

Th-the walls are so slippery and smooth I can’t\nclimb out! No, please, I don’t want to dieeee![VAR 0114(0091)]
You have no Pokémon that can battle. Better\nregroup and come back prepared.
Oh, goodness me, thank you for saving me from\nthat complete and utter disaster![VAR 0114(0091)]
But...but it’s no good! I still haven’t found Wanda![VAR 0114(0091)]
Yeah, about that...
You missed her
Did you save my brother, my trusty savior?![VAR 0114(0070)]
W-wait—you mean Wanda was fine all along?!\nOh...oh, good... Now I can pass out in relief...[VAR 0114(0091)]
I’m sorry I made you worry...[VAR 0114(0070)]
Never mind that! What were you thinking, going\nto a place like the icelands without telling me?[VAR 0114(0091)]
Oh... Well, the fact is...\c\nThe fact is I came here for this![VAR 0114(0070)]
I came to find that stone so I could give it to\nyou, my savior.\c\nI was told it was pretty rare, so I thought maybe\nit could help you with your survey work...[VAR 0114(0070)]
Awww, don’t give me that sad look, Zeke!\nOf course I’ve got one for you, too.[VAR 0114(0070)]
I really owe you both so much! My savior...\nand the one always sending h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer after me!\c\nI’m going to keep working hard to become a\ngreat Security Corps member to pay you two\r\nback for everything you’ve done for me![VAR 0114(0070)]
Come on, bro! Let’s head back home.\c\nI’ve gotten really strong with all my adventures.\nI’m sure I can get you back to the village safe![VAR 0114(0070)]
I’m really glad to hear you think so, Wanda, but...\nthe village is THAT way.[VAR 0114(0091)]
I-I knew that![VAR 0114(0070)]

I came up with a new treat using Candy Truffles,\nbut it’s caused me nothing but sorrow!\c\nEvery last person who tries it says it’s beyond\nsaving. A complete disaster. Utterly terrible.\c\nI’ve had to shelve this new creation, and there it\nremains—in a salty puddle of my bitter tears.\r\nIt’ll likely never see the light of day again.[VAR 0114(004F)]
It seems like I’ll never be able to pull a profit\nfrom my creation, but I’d at least like to share my\r\nrecipe with someone, lest it be forgotten entirely.\c\nYou like making things with your own hands,\ndon’t you? I could share my recipe with you.[VAR 0114(004F)]
I’ve got plenty of Candy Truffles to spare. But\nyou’ll need to bring a Sootfoot Root, a Springy\r\nMushroom, and a Hopo Berry. Got that?[VAR 0114(004F)]
If you want to learn the secrets of making my\nspecial Swap Snacks, you’ll need the ingredients.\c\nBring me a Sootfoot Root, a Springy Mushroom,\nand a Hopo Berry, and I’ll teach you my tricks.\r\nUntil then...can I interest you in a candy?[VAR 0114(004F)]
If you’ve brought a Sootfoot Root, a Springy\nMushroom, and a Hopo Berry, I’d be happy to\r\nuse them to teach you my Swap Snack recipe.\c\nSo how about it?[VAR 0114(004F)]
I’m ready to learn!
Uh, maybe later...
Then learn from the master![VAR 0114(004F)]
[~ 9]
Well, if that isn’t just typical of our famed Survey\nCorps recruit! Took to it like a Finneon to water.[VAR 0114(004F)]
Swap Snacks seem to swap around a Pokémon’s\noffensive stats and defensive stats for a time.\c\nIt’s a curious sort of mix-up, not at all what I was\ngoing for, but life serves up all kinds of surprises![VAR 0114(004F)]
And you Survey Corps folks end up fighting\nagainst all sorts of different Pokémon, don’t you?\c\nIf anyone can find good use for my Swap Snacks,\nI’m sure it would be someone like you.[VAR 0114(004F)]

... ... ...\n... ... ...[VAR 0114(0005)]
I see...\c\nIn that case, the shadow in the Cobalt Coastlands\nmay be none other than Giratina, the Pokémon\r\nsaid to have once been banished to the reverse\r\nside of our world.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I do believe this calls for a survey...[VAR 0114(0005)]
The Cobalt Coastlands are pretty vast. I hope\nyou have some idea where to look![VAR 0114(0030)]
Giygogagohgwooh!
Giratina disappeared somewhere...
You should regroup and come back later to\ntry to catch it again!
You found something shiny where Giratina was!
Volo eventually returned and told me more\nabout what happened at the Temple of Sinnoh...[VAR 0114(0005)]
He said that Giratina... That it chose to protect\nthe land of Hisui after discovering it was no\r\nmatch for you. He said that we should study it\r\nand add it to the Pokédex.[VAR 0114(0005)]
He wandered off after that, saying this was\nprobably the last time we would meet...\c\nBut I can’t help but feel...he’s far more invested\nin our completion of the Pokédex than he would\r\nhave us know...[VAR 0114(0005)]

But what of you? Are you making progress with\nyour...what do you call your studies of Pokémon?\r\nSurveying, was it?[VAR 0114(000D)]
It’s going all right
It’s been better...
Indeed? Well, Hisui still holds more\nfascinating Pokémon.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Shall I speak to you of one of them? Which\nPokémon would you hear about?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Tornadus
Thundurus
Landorus
I’m done, thanks
Ah, yes, Tornadus... In every direction it flies,\nstirring up tremendous storms as it goes.\c\nWhen a blizzard batters the Alabaster Icelands,\nTornadus may be about.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Now, Thundurus—as it flies around, it fires\nbolts of lightning every which way.\c\nWhen a rainstorm lashes the Cobalt Coastlands,\nThundurus may be about.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Ah, yes, Landorus—the Pokémon hailed as the\nGuardian of the Fields.\c\nIt seems it can be glimpsed in the Obsidian\nFieldlands. Perhaps you’d be so good as to catch\r\nit for me?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Is that so? Hm.[VAR 0114(000D)]
I know not why these three have chosen to show\nthemselves. Perhaps the cause lies with the\r\nspace-time rift...or simply with their own whims.\c\nI suppose their stirring up storms and casting\nbolts of lightning may trouble you aplenty, but\r\nnature has need of such things.\c\nIf you wish to know more, you’d best study the\nPokémon for yourself.[VAR 0114(000D)]
When you’ve completed entries in your Pokédex\nfor Landorus, Tornadus, and Thundurus, come\r\nand speak with me.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Well, now! Completed your entries for Landorus,\nTornadus, and Thundurus, have you?\c\nCome to my hideaway, then.[VAR 0114(000D)]
[~ 17]
Ah, you’ve arrived.[VAR 0114(000D)]
You now know much about Landorus, Tornadus,\nand even Thundurus. Well done.[VAR 0114(000D)]
In more normal times, I would bid you let\nthose three fly free as is their nature.\c\nBut we are yet fresh from the tearing of the\nspace-time rift. Until its aftereffects fade entirely,\r\nperhaps it’s better to keep our trio contained.[VAR 0114(000D)]
And now, it is time to tell you the rest.[VAR 0114(000D)]
What is it?
You can’t mean...
There is one more of that cohort.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Come.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Amoooooor!
This is Enamorus—a Pokémon hailed as the\nHerald of Spring.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Enamorus is not particularly given to ill behavior.\nBut I imagine you’d like to document her for your\r\nPokédex, wouldn’t you?\c\nCatch her, then, if you like. She always flits about\nin the Crimson Mirelands.[VAR 0114(000D)]
[~ 29]
Aha—you’ve caught Enamorus as well. And you\nknow much about her.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Enamorus arrives in Hisui once winter has\npassed—hence the epithet Herald of Spring.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Her company, when I have the pleasure, is of\ngreat help—she ferries me hither and yon across\r\nHisui. But I’ll leave her in your care for now,\r\nI suppose.[VAR 0114(000D)]
For now?
In my care?
Indeed—even you can hardly expect to live for\nall time, surely, but she will be in your care\r\nfor now.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Here—this is the Reveal Glass.\c\nIf you use it on Enamorus and her brethren,\nthey will assume different forms.[VAR 0114(000D)]
You, Enamorus, and her brethren have something\nin common: you all tend to stir the pot of life.\r\nDo not mistake me—I mean this positively.\c\nIf everything were straightforward, what meaning\nwould there be in living as long as we do?[VAR 0114(000D)]
“Once there was a god of field,\nand once there was a god of spring.\c\n“Upon Hisui’s winds it wheeled,\nbrought life to every growing thing...”\r\nWas that how that old verse went?
I have passed on to you all there is to pass.\nWhere history goes from here...I leave to you\r\nand your companions to see through.[VAR 0114(000D)]

From the way it swam, it seemed to be drifting on\nthe ocean currents. Now, if I’m not mistaken,\r\nfrom the seas behind Jubilife that would take it\r\nall the way to the Cobalt Coastlands![VAR 0114(0005)]
This rather leaves me wondering if the Pokémon\nwas headed there for some specific purpose...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Given the circumstances, I was thinking that if\nwe spoke with the good Warden Iscan of the\r\nDiamond Clan, we might learn more.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I got your message, Professor Laventon...\c\nSo, uh, you’re looking for a Pokémon that was\nswimming towards the Cobalt Coastlands, yes...?\c\nWell, um, I’m very sorry, but I can’t tell you much\nbased on that alone...[VAR 0114(0013)]
But well... There is one thing I can tell you.\c\nI’ve heard that long ago, the Cobalt Coastlands\nwas known as the East Sea, and...a princely\r\nPokémon was said to live in the waters there.[VAR 0114(0013)]
The story of this princely Pokémon can be found\nin a tome called “The Sea’s Legend”...\c\nBut no one knows much about either the tome\nor its tale, beyond what I’ve just told you...[VAR 0114(0013)]
So, uh... That’s all I know. I...guess I wasn’t much\nhelp after all. Sorry about that.\c\nI’ll, um... I’ll just take my leave here then.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Fioooooo...
You heard something that sounded like a cry\nand a boulder shifting in the distance...
I see you’ve caught our mysterious swimmer...\nSo it was Manaphy all along!\c\nIt seems Manaphy here is a migratory Pokémon,\ndrifting to and fro across the seas since long ago.\c\nAt least, that’s what it says in “The Sea’s Legend.”\nI had a jolly hard time getting hold of this tome...\r\nBut it seems it was worth it in the end![VAR 0114(0005)]

[VAR BD06(0000)]Aha! You must be [VAR 0189(0000)],\nright?\r\nHello!\r\nI heard\r\nabout\r\nyou\r\nfrom\r\nMai!\c\nThank you for taking on my request. I’ll get right\nto the point.[VAR 0114(00EC)]
Once, when I was little, I got lost here in the\nObsidian Fieldlands.\c\nI was wandering around in tears when I stumbled\nacross a field of beautiful flowers.[VAR 0114(00EC)]
That’s where I met it—a Pokémon I’d never\nseen before.[VAR 0114(00EC)]
It gave me a flower and then set off walking,\nas if to guide me somewhere...so I followed it.\c\nAnd it led me back to a place I recognized!\nThanks to that Pokémon, I made it home safely![VAR 0114(00EC)]
But I never got to properly thank it. I’d like to\nfind it again and tell it how grateful I am![VAR 0114(00EC)]
The only problem is, I haven’t been able to find\nthat field of flowers. So I’d like you to help me![VAR 0114(00EC)]
Here—this is the only clue I’ve got.[VAR 0114(00EC)]
That’s called a Gracidea flower. It’s the same\nflower as the one that Pokémon gave me.[VAR 0114(00EC)]
Please find the field of Gracidea flowers here\nin the Obsidian Fieldlands for me![VAR 0114(00EC)]
This seems to be the flower field Medi has been\nlooking for...
Is this...the field from back then?[VAR 0114(00EC)]
The flowers may be withered, but I remember\nthese surroundings exactly.\c\nThis has to be the place...[VAR 0114(00EC)]
Excuse me! Can you hear me, kind Pokémon?[VAR 0114(00EC)]
A long time ago, I got lost out here and you\nguided me back.[VAR 0114(00EC)]
I don’t know if I’d have made it home without\nyou! So I just came to say...[VAR 0114(00EC)]
Thank you so much![VAR 0114(00EC)]
Kyuu uuhn!
Th-the flowers![VAR 0114(00EC)]
Thank you very much, [VAR 0189(0000)]!\c\nI’ll make sure to thank Mai for pointing me\ntoward you as well.[VAR 0114(00EC)]
I suppose you’ll be staying here to study\nthat Pokémon?\c\nWell, good luck with your work. Take care![VAR 0114(00EC)]

You the one who accepted my request? Well\nthen, let’s get right to business.[VAR 0114(00ED)]
There’s an old tale that’s long been told in the\nHisui region about a dark nightmare that visits\r\npeople on lonely paths at night.\c\nI never put any stock in it myself...until I saw it.\c\nI saw a terrifying black Pokémon just like the\none in the stories![VAR 0114(00ED)]
They say that people who are trapped in the\nnightmares it creates never wake again.\c\nWe can’t wait for someone to fall victim to it.\nWe’ve got to act before that can happen.[VAR 0114(00ED)]
I saw it near the Clamberclaw Cliffs, partway up\nMount Coronet...\c\nAnd it was when I was out walking alone at night,\njust like the old stories all say.[VAR 0114(00ED)]
Be careful if you go in search of it... I wouldn’t\nwant you to lose your life over this.[VAR 0114(00ED)]
You don’t see any sign of the black Pokémon\nthat Cael spoke of...\c\nYou’d better come back at night.
Astounding![VAR 0114(00ED)]
Now everyone will be able to rest easy.[VAR 0114(00ED)]
Yes... Now no one else will fall victim to such\ndark nightmares...[VAR 0114(00ED)]
I suppose I’d better be heading back home\nmyself now. But I won’t ever forget what you did!\c\nFarewell, young one![VAR 0114(00ED)]

[VAR BD06(0000)]Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nCheck\r\nout\r\nthis\r\nphoto\r\nof\r\nthe\r\nspace-time rift.[VAR 0114(001F)]
A photo?
The rift?
Yeah—it’s a photo Professor Laventon took to try\nand document what was happening.[VAR 0114(001F)]
He was going on about how a bunch of universes\nwere overlapping and generating some type of\r\npower overflow...\c\nIt went right over my head, basically. Might as\nwell have been babble.[VAR 0114(001F)]
But the photo kinda tickled my creative side,\nso I borrowed it, thinking I could maybe make a\r\npainting out of it.\c\nAnd since you saw the rift right up close,\nI wanted to ask you—what’d you think of it?[VAR 0114(001F)]
I sensed power...
It was terrifying...
I get that. Must be chilling, facing power like that\nup close.[VAR 0114(001F)]
All right, that gives me something to start with!\c\nThis won’t be some neat, clean building blueprint\nlike I usually deal in, though... This is gonna be a\r\nwork of unbridled emotion![VAR 0114(001F)]
And that’s that done![VAR 0114(001F)]
Once you told me what it was like falling out\nof that rift, it basically painted itself![VAR 0114(001F)]
What’s the title?
Does it have a name?
I’m thinking...it’ll be untitled.\c\nPeople can feel what they want from it. No need\nto force it into words.[VAR 0114(001F)]
Are you gonna display it?
So...what now?
Yeah, that’s the thing... All that terror and unease\nabout the rift must still be fresh in everyone’s\r\nminds. I think I’d better give people some time to\r\ncool off before I go hanging this up somewhere.[VAR 0114(001F)]
Our collective memory of the space-time rift will\nfade in time, no doubt.\c\nI hope my painting is able to inspire the people\nof the future somehow—even if they don’t know\r\nanything about the events behind the painting.[VAR 0114(001F)]
I’ll entrust it to the commander for safekeeping.\nThanks for the help, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(001F)]
Our collective memory of the space-time rift will\nfade in time, no doubt.\c\nI wonder what kind of feelings Sanqua’s painting\nwill inspire in people when that time comes?[VAR 0114(001F)]

Did that make your ears perk up? Happy to fill\nyou in, if you’re curious...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Yeah, I’m curious
I don’t really care...
There’s that Survey Corps spirit!\c\nCuriosity’s what moves science forward,\naccording to good old Mr. Professor.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Come on—don’t be like that!\c\nCuriosity’s what moves science forward,\naccording to good old Mr. Professor![VAR 0114(000A)]
But come to think of it, what I’ve found seems\ntoo valuable to just let you in on it for free.\r\nYou’ll need to work a little![VAR 0114(000A)]
Here’s the deal. I want you to show me what’s\nin your mind, your heart...your soul!\c\nIn short: battle me![VAR 0114(000A)]
You got it!
I’ll pass
What—oh, come on! I promise, this’ll be exciting!\nOr did you run out of excitement after everything\r\non Mount Coronet?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Then it’s on! Time to see what you’ve got.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Here I come, knowing full well how tough you\nare... For the future of the Diamond Clan![VAR 0114(000A)]
You’re really something...and I’m a man of my\nword. So, here’s that treasure.[VAR 0114(000A)]
This used to be my grandfather’s.\c\nHe said it was somehow related to almighty\nSinn—I mean, to mighty Dialga.[VAR 0114(000A)]
So, now that I’ve put you through the wringer a\nlittle, it seems right to give it to you since you’re\r\nthe one who caught mighty Dialga![VAR 0114(000A)]
Y’know, I ought to tell you...I’m glad it was you\nwho fell out of the sky to us.\c\nYou taught me another way to get along with\nPokémon...another way to relate to the world![VAR 0114(000A)]

Hello, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000B)]
I was just about to go find you and tell you about\nthis precious—incredibly precious—thing I found!\r\nAre you curious? Tantalized?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I am curious
If you say so
As you should be!\c\nThere isn’t a single person in all of vast Hisui who\nwouldn’t be interested in treasure.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh, come on! It’s a treasure! If you don’t take it\nnow, those bandit sisters might get it first.[VAR 0114(000B)]
But anyway, before I show you... Can you guess\nwhat I want to do?[VAR 0114(000B)]
You want to battle?
Not a clue
Please, take the hint! I’m saying I want to have a\nbattle with you![VAR 0114(000B)]
Yes, exactly!\nI want to be able to achieve feats like yours—\r\nlike what you did atop Mount Coronet.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Now, give me one moment. I need to\ncenter myself.[VAR 0114(000B)]
My partners and I are going to get stronger and\ntravel all across this wide world![VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I wonder, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nAre there\r\npeople\r\neven\r\nstronger\r\nthan\r\nyou\r\nout\r\nin the\r\nworld,\r\nwith\r\nPokémon\r\nstronger\r\nthan yours?\c\nI’ll just have to find out for myself, I suppose!\nHere! The treasure I promised you.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m told this once belonged to the founder of\nthe Pearl Clan!\c\nIt’s somehow connected to almighty Sinn—er, to\nmighty Palkia, I mean.[VAR 0114(000B)]
And since mighty Palkia’s with you now...I’ll\nentrust the Lustrous Globe to you, too![VAR 0114(000B)]

Ah. Say no more, old [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl, that’s quite all right.\nMy door is always open if you change your mind.[VAR 0114(0005)]

We’ve some rather special news to share, so\nplease lend us your ears, if you’d be so kind![VAR 0114(0005)]
Today marks the fulfillment of a long held dream\nof mine, and the fruition of the most earnest\r\nefforts of the entire Survey Corps.\c\nYes indeed, for, you see, the Pokédex, our corps’\nmagnum opus, is finally...at long last...[VAR 0114(0005)]
COMPLETE!!![VAR 0114(0005)]
Is this true?
This fantastic achievement wouldn’t have been\npossible if not for the hard work—no, the heroic\r\nefforts of our very own [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
From h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser quelling of the frenzied Lord Kleavor\nall the way up to h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser battles against Dialga and\r\nPalkia atop mighty Mount Coronet...\c\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe tirelessly surveyed the Pokémon of this land\nwhile facing perils of the sort that would send\r\nmost of us running for the hills![VAR 0114(0005)]
All this has led to our accomplishing what can\nonly be described as a remarkable triumph of\r\nhuman effort: the completion of a Pokédex.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Outstanding!
Hrrrm. So, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nYou’re still very much a mysterious stranger who\nfell from the sky...[VAR 0114(0009)]
And I know not whether your actions were\nmotivated by your own curiosity or a genuine\r\ndesire to help the people of our village...\c\nBut it doesn’t matter. You have been a great\nasset to us, and I am truly grateful for everything\r\nyou’ve done.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Perhaps I should also study under the professor,\nso I might learn more about Pokémon.\c\nCyllene is quite capable of handling the duties\nof commander, I am sure.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Commendable work.[VAR 0114(0008)]
In recognition of your effort, I present you with\nthis Shiny Charm.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Tonight’s potato mochi are my treat! I’ll make\n’em extra tasty![VAR 0114(000E)]

The next day...
[VAR BD06(0000)]What a party yesterday was!\nRight, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nBut we can’t relax just yet. The Pokédex may be\ncomplete, but think how many mysteries\r\nPokémon still hold![VAR 0114(0006)]

I wonder if the hole that appeared in the sky is\nsome sort of bad omen...[VAR 0114(0057)]
I hear you passed your trial![VAR 0114(0057)]
Honestly...I’m not sure whether battling with\nPokémon makes you brave or reckless.[VAR 0114(0057)]
So the hole in the sky was a bad sign after all...[VAR 0114(0057)]
A lot has changed since you fell out of the sky![VAR 0114(0057)]
The Galaxy Team is made up of several corps.\nLet’s see... There’s the Security, Construction,\r\nand Agriculture Corps...and a few others besides![VAR 0114(0059)]
What an odd way to dress. Is that fashionable\nwhere you’re from?[VAR 0114(0040)]
Oh, you’re from the Survey Corps? Well then...\c\nCan you tell me how Pokémon make themselves\nso tiny?[VAR 0114(0040)]
If I had a Pokémon pal with me, I bet I’d feel\nmuch safer wandering around the wilds...[VAR 0114(0040)]
It’s the end of the world... I should never have\ncome to Hisui...[VAR 0114(0040)]
I’ve heard that in some faraway regions, people\ncompete with each other by having their partner\r\nPokémon do battle.[VAR 0114(0040)]
I wonder if there are other Pokémon besides\nPonyta that can look so different but are still\r\nconsidered the same species... Wouldn’t that\r\nbe fun![VAR 0114(0040)]
Sure, it’s nice and peaceful inside the village...\c\nBut one step beyond the gates, and the land is\njust teeming with scary Pokémon![VAR 0114(0045)]
Did you pass your trial? Wait—but you’d need to\nleave the village for that, right?[VAR 0114(0045)]
It’s hard to believe you can catch Pokémon using\nthose Poké Ball things...[VAR 0114(0045)]
I tried to catch a Pokémon, but it didn’t end\nwell... How’s a guy supposed to get close when\r\nthey keep pelting you with attacks?[VAR 0114(0045)]
The festival sure was something, huh?\c\nI met lotsa folks from the clans and stuffed my\nface with food! Even Pokémon joined the fun!\r\nIt was great to see everyone together like that.[VAR 0114(0045)]
We’ve no food for freeloaders. Survival out here\nis a daily battle, you know![VAR 0114(0048)]
Give the Survey Corps your all, you hear?\nAfter all, we’ve no food for freeloaders.[VAR 0114(0048)]
If you need new garments, you should head to\nthe clothier. They have an impressive selection![VAR 0114(0048)]
If this mess gets much worse, we may have to\nabandon the village...[VAR 0114(0048)]
I’m seeing more and more people with partner\nPokémon these days... I’m sure we have the\r\nSurvey Cor— No...we have you to thank for this.[VAR 0114(0048)]
It’s my dream to have my own shop that\nspecializes in unbitter herbal medicines![VAR 0114(0048)]
I had a rather traumatic experience when a wild\nPokémon attacked me... Now I’m scared to even\r\nset foot outside the village.[VAR 0114(0049)]
You Survey Corps lot are amazing! I mean...you\ncatch all these strange Pokémon like it’s nothing![VAR 0114(0049)]
People fear what they don’t know. But we might\nbe able to move on from that mindset if you\r\nkeep up those surveys of yours.[VAR 0114(0049)]
I find myself wondering what sort of creatures\nPokémon really are...\c\nThey’re clearly far more dangerous than even\ntyphoons or earthquakes...[VAR 0114(0049)]
Once we all start learning more about Pokémon\nfrom that Pokédex of yours, I think we’ll find\r\nthem much less frightening.[VAR 0114(0049)]
Ouch, ouch, ouch! Well, I didn’t even stand\na chance...\c\nI should have heeded the warning in your\nPokédex and been a bit more careful.[VAR 0114(0049)]
Back in my hometown, I’ve got an older brother\nwho’s gonna inherit the family farm an’ all.\r\nBut I’m gonna make my own way here in Hisui![VAR 0114(005F)]

Wow, you’re amazing! I want a partner\nPokémon, too![VAR 0114(005F)]
You’ll get us outta this...won’t you...?[VAR 0114(005F)]
All the shops ’n’ stuff in Jubilife are real nice\nnow! So I guess...time to build a new village?[VAR 0114(005F)]
They say hunger is the best seasoning, but I’d\nrather rely on the quality of my Sootfoot Roots\r\nto make my potato mochi tasty.[VAR 0114(000E)]
At what point does a stranger become one of us?\nI wonder where that boundary lies...[VAR 0114(000E)]
I did what I came to do here in Hisui. Now I\nsuppose it’s time for me to head someplace\r\nwith a more agreeable climate.[VAR 0114(000E)]
This region is huuuge! And there’s lotsa\ndangerous Pokémon, too! But you came here\r\nanyway... How come?[VAR 0114(0060)]
Wooow, you caught Pokémon?![VAR 0114(0060)]
What’s it like, battlin’ scary-strong Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0060)]

Hey, can anyone make friends with Pokémon\nif they have Poké Balls?[VAR 0114(0060)]
If I can catch a partner Pokémon with the Poké\nBalls you gave me, it’ll help me become an\r\nawesome member of the Galaxy Team for sure![VAR 0114(0060)]
Those Survey Corps people... What is it they’re\nactually investigating?\c\nAll they seem to do is eat potato mochi at\nthe Wallflower. Are they making some sort of\r\nPotato Dex or what?[VAR 0114(002F)]
So you’re the new recruit from the Survey Corps?\nDon’t slack off on making that Pokédex of yours.[VAR 0114(002F)]

This is the end... Even someone as strong as you\ncan’t stop a cataclysm like this, can you?[VAR 0114(002F)]
I think I’ll ask Melli of the Diamond Clan to join\nme for a sparring session sometime.[VAR 0114(002F)]
I’m glad we managed to prevent that Drifloon\nfrom causing any real trouble. Now we just need\r\nto post more guards out on Prelude Beach...[VAR 0114(002F)]
Commander Kamado is fantastically strong!\c\nRumor has it he once sent a Pokémon flying\nwith one of those sumo throws he’s so proud of![VAR 0114(002A)]
Looks like you got some skills, kid. Good thing,\ntoo—it’s dangerous outside the village![VAR 0114(002A)]
The Pokémon nobles are seriously powerful\nPokémon that protect the Diamond and\r\nPearl Clans...\c\nIt’s incredible to think you’re even stronger than\nthey are![VAR 0114(002A)]
Even Commander Kamado can’t win against a\nforce of nature...[VAR 0114(002A)]
I hear some Galaxy folks plan to turn one of\nour base camps into a new village.[VAR 0114(002A)]
My li’l buddy here will evolve into the best\nBeautifly there ever was. You’ll see![VAR 0114(002A)]
The Silcoon look suits my buddy for sure.\nBut I can’t wait to see it as a Beautifly![VAR 0114(002A)]
Haaah... Why would the professor say that?[VAR 0114(002A)]
I love my buddy, no matter what it looks like!\nBut its nickname needs changing, I guess...\c\nTo rename one of your Pokémon, you just need\nto choose it from your party, right?[VAR 0114(002A)]
Pokémon t-terrify me... Even going out to gather\nBerries is the worst...[VAR 0114(002C)]
Hisui is positively bursting with Bidoof and lots\nof other Pokémon besides. It’s no exaggeration\r\nto say this land belongs to them, really.\c\nI just don’t think humans are ready to settle\nhere yet...[VAR 0114(002C)]
Are you teaching your Pokémon new moves?\c\nMake sure to check how your party Pokémon are\ndoing as often as you can![VAR 0114(002C)]
That terrifying being atop Mount Coronet... I get\nwhy people might see such a thing as a deity.[VAR 0114(002C)]
I hear Captain Zisu wants to build a dojo to\nteach everyone how to battle with Pokémon![VAR 0114(002C)]
Those pesky Bidoof gave me some valuable\ntraining. Now I’m really on the ball with my\r\nSecurity Corps duties![VAR 0114(002C)]
It’s a brave new land we’re living in! Gotta learn\nmore about the Pokémon here![VAR 0114(0038)]
It’s a brave new land we’re living in! Which means\nthere’s a whole lot to do...[VAR 0114(0038)]
Maybe we could use the strange powers of\nPokémon to help our crops grow faster?[VAR 0114(0038)]
I just want Paira and Waka to escape safely...\nI don’t think that’s too much for a father to ask.[VAR 0114(0038)]
Humans and Pokémon living together...\nI can’t wait to see what the future has in store![VAR 0114(0038)]
Hey, Survey Corps kid! Do you like Cherrim\nbetter when it’s budding or when it’s in bloom?\c\nI think both forms of Cherrim are great, myself.[VAR 0114(0038)]
We Galaxy folks may be one big group now, but\nwe drifted here from all over the place—Kanto,\r\nJohto... You name it!\c\nThey should call us the Ragtag Expedition Team![VAR 0114(0033)]
Pokémon are full of mysteries... I hope you can\nhelp us solve them.[VAR 0114(0033)]
Partnering up with Pokémon is much better than\nfighting against them, don’t you think?[VAR 0114(0033)]
It may well be impossible for humans to ever\ncompletely understand Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0033)]
How does it feel to have caught a Pokémon\nrevered by some as a deity?[VAR 0114(0033)]
Zubat’s the best Pokémon to have with you for\nguard duty, both during the day and at night![VAR 0114(0033)]
All the new folks coming to Jubilife will need\nfeeding. I should get to collecting some honey![VAR 0114(0039)]
You have [VAR 1101(00FD,0002)]a Pokémon with you...? Wow... And\n[VAR 1101(00FD,0707)]it doesthey don’t attack you?[VAR 0114(0039)]
I get why Pokémon would want to attack us.\c\nFrom their point of view, we’re the intruders\nafter all...[VAR 0114(0039)]
If we grew crops that Pokémon could eat,\nmaybe we could become friends with them?[VAR 0114(0039)]
Some Pokémon are so sturdy, they’d be great for\nhelping us plow the fields![VAR 0114(0039)]
Ever since I found out that each Combee swarm\nmakes a different flavor of honey, I can hardly\r\nwait to harvest my honey and find out how\r\nit tastes![VAR 0114(0039)]
Galaxy Hall’s built in a modern style. We worked\nin design elements from the Galar region, too.[VAR 0114(001F)]
Maybe we oughta build some spare lodgings in\ncase anyone else falls out of the sky.[VAR 0114(001F)]
It’d sure be nice if we could gather materials in\npeace and have a safe home to come back to.[VAR 0114(001F)]
All that matters right now is keeping our people\nalive. The village can be rebuilt.[VAR 0114(001F)]
I’ve heard talk lately that we might start building\nnew villages while we keep expanding Jubilife.[VAR 0114(001F)]
I don’t know which was the bigger shock—\nthat a Pichu had been in my house or that it\r\ncame just to say thank you!\c\nSeems some Pokémon have real decency.[VAR 0114(001F)]
Rest until tomorrow morning?
You won’t find any Pokémon on Prelude Beach.\nIt’s about as safe as things get around here.
Here at the seaside gate, sure, it’s pretty safe.\nNo wild Pokémon round here, after all.[VAR 0114(0031)]
Whenever I see Prelude Beach, it reminds me of\nthe day I first arrived in Hisui...[VAR 0114(0031)]
It’s almost as if the very land of Hisui is rejecting\nus... But where else are we supposed to go?[VAR 0114(0031)]
I’m sure glad you came here! Thanks to you,\nit seems Hisui has finally accepted us.[VAR 0114(0031)]
They say the Pokémon of Hisui are even more\nsavage and powerful than those of other regions.[VAR 0114(0029)]
If only I had a whole bunch of partner Pokémon...\nThen guard duty would be so much easier.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Your partner Pokémon must be [VAR 1101(00FD,0E0F)]a solid fightersolid fighters if\nyou managed to quell a frenzied Pokémon noble.[VAR 0114(0029)]
If Pokémon are what test our strength in Hisui,\nmaybe Pokémon will also be the ones to save us.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Pokémon won’t ever disappear from the world,\nno matter how many you catch.\c\nThat means we’re always going to need people\nlike me to stand guard.[VAR 0114(0029)]
They may be the same species, but the big and\nthe small Buizel seem totally different.[VAR 0114(0029)]
As the village grows, it seems we can’t avoid\nattracting odd folks like you...[VAR 0114(003B)]
What with new folks pouring in all the time, we\ngotta work to make Jubilife the best it can be.[VAR 0114(003B)]
If Pokémon can sleep inside their balls, I guess\nthat means they’re more comfy than they look.[VAR 0114(003B)]
Between the Starly that scamper away at the\ndrop of a hat and this Pokémon on top of\r\nMount Coronet...there’s really a crazy variety\r\nof Pokémon out there.[VAR 0114(003B)]
I wonder if Jubilife will grow into a big ol’ city\none day?[VAR 0114(003B)]
No matter what form he takes, Eevee is always\ncute when he stuffs his little cheeks with food.[VAR 0114(003B)]
Thanks to those Jubilife Muffins, Eevee and I are\ncloser than ever. Living with a Pokémon can be\r\nquite a lot of fun![VAR 0114(003B)]
Our human weapons are no match against the\nfangs and claws of Pokémon![VAR 0114(0034)]
Throwing Poké Balls is all well and good.\nJust don’t throw away your life, kid![VAR 0114(0034)]
To fight against Pokémon, we need to borrow\nthe strength of other Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0034)]
Can the Pokémon on Mount Coronet really be\ncaught inside a Poké Ball?![VAR 0114(0034)]
The more we know about Pokémon, the less we\nfear them...\c\nIt’s funny that we can form such a bond with them\nwhen they don’t understand human speech![VAR 0114(0034)]
Thanks to you, Pachirisu and I are really in sync.\c\nEven Captain Zisu is full of praise for our battle\nskills these days![VAR 0114(0034)]
The Snorlax that Commander Kamado keeps with\nhim is a huge Pokémon. And it’s always sleeping![VAR 0114(0064)]
It’s rather impressive that you can get so close to\nPokémon while they’re firing attacks at you!\r\nOh, I bet you’re skilled at dodging![VAR 0114(0064)]
Your accuracy in throwing Poké Balls exactly\nwhere you want is quite remarkable!\r\nI bet you make sure to focus before throwing![VAR 0114(0064)]
*sigh*\nI suppose this is it for our world...[VAR 0114(0064)]
Even if we caught all the Pokémon in Hisui, there\nwould still be plenty of Pokémon elsewhere in\r\nthe world, no?[VAR 0114(0064)]
[~ 118]
A new hairstyle means a fresh outlook. And a\nfresh outlook lets you change your fortunes![VAR 0114(005C)]
New arrivals coming to live in the village, hm?\nIt’s probably high time I had myself an assistant...\r\nor rather, a successor.[VAR 0114(005C)]
Hisui is done for... Right after I entrusted the\nsalon to young Arezu, too. What dreadful timing.[VAR 0114(005C)]
It’s hard to care about things like your hairstyle\nwhen you’re struggling to survive.[VAR 0114(005C)]
I came here from across the sea in search of\nfields to call my very own.\c\nFor this venture of mine to succeed, I need to\nmake sure we can work these fields safely.[VAR 0114(001E)]
It’s tough picking Berries out in the wilds, so I’m\nhoping we can grow them here instead.[VAR 0114(001E)]
Apparently even Pokémon have some flavors\nthey prefer over others. Though I suppose that’s\r\nprobably true for all living things.[VAR 0114(001E)]
We’re in dire straits—no doubt about it—but...it’s\nalso thrilling to witness something so unusual![VAR 0114(001E)]
It’s impossible to go against nature when you’re\nfarming. You simply have to deal with whatever\r\nnature throws at you![VAR 0114(001E)]
If you’re gonna live here from now on, I suggest\nyou sign up with the Galaxy Team.[VAR 0114(003A)]
Some Pokémon prefer rainy days, you know.\nMe, I just stay inside and enjoy a nice nap.[VAR 0114(003A)]
Some Pokémon only come out at night, you\nknow. I’m always asleep in my quarters by then,\r\nbut to each their own![VAR 0114(003A)]
What a frightening sky... I think I’ll head to my\nquarters and rest for now.[VAR 0114(003A)]
I might’ve overdone it a bit at the festival...\nI’ll just go sleep it off in my quarters.[VAR 0114(003A)]
We’re in the middle of nowhere out here.\nWe have to make what we need ourselves.[VAR 0114(0021)]
If you’re short on items...craft more yourself!\c\nIf you want to craft new items...collect recipes![VAR 0114(0021)]
The more widely you explore, the more materials\nyou’ll find...and thus, the more items you’ll be\r\nable to craft![VAR 0114(0021)]
I’m afraid I can’t think of an item that would help\nus fix this sky.[VAR 0114(0021)]
Seems we’ll have far more people choosing to\nshare their lives with Pokémon from now on.\c\nWhich means I’ll need to churn out plenty of\nPoké Balls![VAR 0114(0021)]
If we want to guard the village properly, we’ll\nneed to partner up with Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0032)]
If there’s a place you’re hoping to visit, you\nought to stretch out your map and put a pin in it.[VAR 0114(0032)]
The more base camps we have, the easier it’ll be\nto reach even the most remote corners of Hisui![VAR 0114(0032)]
Even you Survey Corps folks can’t find out what’s\ncausing this bizarre sky, can you?\r\nIt’s not something you can survey![VAR 0114(0032)]
Professor Laventon sure goes to the base camps\na lot. He says it’s just for the sake of his research,\r\nbut it’s still amazing![VAR 0114(0032)]
It’s safe here in Jubilife Village. Don’t forget\nyou can always return here to rest and recover.[VAR 0114(0020)]
If you’ve been attacked by a Pokémon, you can\nalways go to a base camp to rest.[VAR 0114(0020)]
It’s good to look out for your own health, but\nmake sure your Pokémon are fighting fit, too!\c\nIf not, you’ll all be in trouble if a wild\nPokémon attacks.[VAR 0114(0020)]
I’m so worried, I can’t get a wink of sleep.\nWith this sky, you can’t even tell night from day.[VAR 0114(0020)]
I wish the base camps had roofs. Then you would\nfeel even safer when visiting them![VAR 0114(0020)]
So...this village of ours also attracts strange-\ngarbed folks like yerself, eh?[VAR 0114(0037)]
Gotta expand these ’ere fields to help feed all\nthe new folks comin’ to the village.[VAR 0114(0037)]
Yer a decent [VAR 1100(00FF,0306)]fellergal after all![VAR 0114(0037)]
I know yer mighty skilled and all, but ain’t\nnothin’ doin’ about this red sky![VAR 0114(0037)]
The sky might turn red again one day...but we’ll\ndeal with that when it happens![VAR 0114(0037)]
Thanks to that Pokémon you lent us, the soil\nin these fields is soft ’n’ fluffy as a pillow!\r\nI reckon we can grow some fine crops ’ere now.[VAR 0114(0037)]
Now even this fine expanse o’ fields has aaaaaall\nthe water it needs. Pokémon sure are amazin’![VAR 0114(0037)]
Yer Pokémon’s helped us smash up the rocks\ninside the soil, too! Even long-rooted plants ain’t\r\ngonna be no problem now!\c\nIt’s all thanks to you that Pokémon are helpin’ the\nvillage like this. We owe ya one![VAR 0114(0037)]
We’re running low on Potions... Guess I’ll need\nto go and gather more materials...[VAR 0114(0028)]
You’re part of the Survey Corps now, right?\nYou should craft your own Potions.[VAR 0114(0028)]
Make sure you always carry plenty of medicine\nto heal your Pokémon after battle.\c\nAfter all, you wouldn’t stand a chance against\nwild Pokémon on your own![VAR 0114(0028)]
I don’t know what will become of the sky—or the\nwhole of Hisui for that matter—but I’ll continue\r\nto heal the sick, no matter what![VAR 0114(0028)]
There would certainly be fewer casualties if\neveryone had a partner Pokémon with them.[VAR 0114(0028)]
The captain of the Survey Corps, Cyllene...\nI wonder if anything actually scares her?[VAR 0114(003C)]
It’s amazing that Captain Cyllene has\nacknowledged your potential.[VAR 0114(003C)]
You’re researching the noble Pokémon, too?\nMy, being in the Survey Corps must be tough.[VAR 0114(003C)]
I suppose even bizarre things like this happen to\nyou if you live long enough.[VAR 0114(003C)]
For people and Pokémon alike, nothing is more\nimportant than health.[VAR 0114(003C)]
I came here all the way from Hoenn... But this\nland has nothing in it![VAR 0114(003D)]
I came here all the way from Hoenn... But this\nland is horrendous![VAR 0114(003D)]
I came here all the way from Hoenn... It seems\nthis land is just getting interesting![VAR 0114(003D)]
It may be a small thing, but it sure feels great to\nbe able to make what’s needed for the team![VAR 0114(003E)]
A trusty satchel is a must if you want to gather\nlots of materials for crafting.\c\nYou should speak to Bagin—he’ll teach you how\nto pack even more into that satchel of yours![VAR 0114(003E)]
You should try experimenting with different items\nif you’re going to catch Pokémon. I imagine\r\ncake-lures should work a treat![VAR 0114(003E)]
I’ll just keep on making tools and hope things\nget back to normal soon enough...[VAR 0114(003E)]
If Jubilife gets much bigger, we won’t be able to\ncraft items fast enough to keep up with demand...\c\nWe gotta think of a way to make items more\nefficiently somehow![VAR 0114(003E)]
I can’t wait for the next full moon so I can go see\nthe Clefairy dance![VAR 0114(003E)]
You can throw spoiled Apricorns at wild Pokémon\nto make them drop their defenses. Then they’ll\r\nbe easier to catch![VAR 0114(0026)]
I hear the village pastures will take care of any\nPokémon you catch.[VAR 0114(0026)]
You can buy new recipes for making items over at\nthe craftworks.[VAR 0114(0026)]
This is just awful. I’m at a loss for words...[VAR 0114(0026)]
Have you managed to get hold of all the crafting\nrecipes? I know about 40 of them, myself.[VAR 0114(0026)]
Don’t you forget—Starly is the cutest little thing\nin the world! I’m just...too scared to touch it.[VAR 0114(0026)]
Here at the craftworks, we sell materials and\nrecipes. Can I help you with something?[VAR 0114(0050)]
See something you want? It’s yours, for a price.\nIf it’s not here, by all means, craft it yourself.[VAR 0114(001C)]
I wonder if there’s anyone capable of catching\nenough Pokémon to fill all the pastures here...[VAR 0114(0053)]
Whoa, there! It’s dangerous beyond these gates.\nYou should stay inside the village.
Yeah, I heard. You passed your trial, right?\nNow go report to Captain Cyllene.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Now that you’ve passed your trial, you should\nlearn how to craft items.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Errr, isn’t Rei waiting for you over at the\ntraining grounds?[VAR 0114(0030)]
Errr, isn’t Akari waiting for you over at the\ntraining grounds?[VAR 0114(0030)]
Yeah, I heard. You passed your trial, right?\nYou should go change into your uniform.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Hm? Aren’t you going to battle Adaman?[VAR 0114(0030)]
Isn’t Irida waiting for you at the training grounds?\nYou should go see her before you leave.[VAR 0114(0030)]

A fine day to you, my friend! Care to peruse our\ntop-notch selection of rarities?[VAR 0114(0036)]
Hello!
The people of this world fear Pokémon. It is\nbeyond them to befriend Pokémon and have\r\nthem battle, I’m afraid.[VAR 0114(0015)]
If you gather rare materials from far-flung places,\nyou’ll be able to craft all sorts of items![VAR 0114(0035)]
As long as we have customers to serve, we’ll keep\non selling—end of the world or no![VAR 0114(0035)]
If people and Pokémon start living together,\nI’m sure some people out there will see that as\r\na great new business opportunity![VAR 0114(0035)]
I still can’t believe that journal melted into\nthin air like it was under a Pokémon’s spell!\c\nI like to think it’s now returned to where\nit belongs.[VAR 0114(0035)]
Lemme get this straight... Outside the village\nthere’s terrifying Pokémon. And now inside the\r\nvillage there’s strange folk like you?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Get Pokémon...to help with our manual work...?\nNo way, that’s crazy talk.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Get Pokémon...to help with our work...?\nNow why didn’t I think of that![VAR 0114(0027)]
It’s clear we’re not in charge here in Hisui.\nThis land belongs to Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0027)]
We’re seein’ more and more Pokémon inside the\nvillage these days... Things have changed so\r\nquickly round here![VAR 0114(0027)]
The markings on Shinx’s ears are different\nthan Luxio’s![VAR 0114(0027)]
You’re new... Are you here to replace that guy\nwho went back to his hometown after\r\ngetting injured?[VAR 0114(0043)]
What? You came here to pass our entry trial?\nNo wonder I’d never seen you before![VAR 0114(0043)]
If you’re attacked by Pokémon or fall off a\ntall ledge or cliff, you’ll black out for sure!\r\nBe careful out there![VAR 0114(0043)]
I picked the wrong place to come and make a\nname for myself... I just want to go home.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Andra, Beauregard, and I came to Hisui hoping\nto achieve great things out here. We’ll work hard\r\nto make our dream come true![VAR 0114(0043)]
There’s always a need for labor here. It’s the\nperfect place to make myself useful!\c\nIt’s not like I was doing much back\nhome, anyway...[VAR 0114(0044)]
Is there anything at all I can do to help...?[VAR 0114(0044)]
If some Pokémon stole my pack and ate the\ncontents...I guess you could say I was useful\r\nto the Pokémon, right?[VAR 0114(0044)]
I took on a buncha work to make myself useful to\nthe village...but in the end, all I could do was rely\r\non you. Thanks for saving all our hides.[VAR 0114(0044)]
I’m pretty new to the village myself.\c\nI try to talk to everyone I meet so I always learn\nsomething new![VAR 0114(0046)]

The Milkiwa River runs through the village.\nBut where does its journey end?[VAR 0114(004B)]
At the end of the day, Pokémon are wild\ncreatures. It’s normal for some to trust us and\r\nfor others to treat us as enemies.[VAR 0114(004B)]
I wonder how the Diamond and Pearl Clans\nare feeling now?[VAR 0114(004B)]
I left the store I had in Johto in the hands of\nmy son and his wife.
To catch one of those Pokémon creatures, you\nneed to throw a Poké Ball at it![VAR 0114(005B)]
You young sprouts can’t hold a candle to me!\nBut I’ll leave the surveys to you, [VAR 1100(00FF,0404)]sonnmissy.[VAR 0114(005B)]
You young sprouts can’t hold a candle to me!\nBut I’ll leave battling the noble Pokémon\r\nto you, [VAR 1100(00FF,0404)]sonnmissy.[VAR 0114(005B)]
You young sprouts can’t hold a candle to me!\nBut strange holes in the sky, now that’s a\r\ndifferent story...[VAR 0114(005B)]
Do your Pokémon think of you as a parent? If so,\nyou have to look after them properly!\c\nThough from what I can see, your Pokémon are\nthe ones taking care of you...[VAR 0114(005B)]
I-if you intend to stay here in the village, you\nshould spend some time talking to everyone.[VAR 0114(005E)]
Everyone has problems and worries of their own.\nYou should lend an ear to the people you meet![VAR 0114(005E)]
Everyone has problems and worries of their own.\nYou should lend an ear to the people you meet![VAR 0114(005E)]
I imagine we’re all troubled by precisely the same\nthing these days—that worrisome sky above us.\r\nWhat can we do about it?[VAR 0114(005E)]
We may just be one small village, but lots of\npeople and Pokémon live together here now.[VAR 0114(005E)]
We need to keep improving the village for all\nthe people who come here from far and wide![VAR 0114(0061)]
If I’d known this was going to happen, I never\nwould have come to Hisui![VAR 0114(0061)]
Now that I’ve a family here in Hisui, it’s time to\nput down my roots for good.[VAR 0114(0061)]
Did you know that Beni ventures out of the\nvillage by himself to gather cooking ingredients?\c\nAnd he’s never been attacked by a wild\nPokémon. Not even once![VAR 0114(006E)]
Beni never talks about his past, but I wish he\nwould tell me where he learned to cook...[VAR 0114(006E)]
I had such a shock when I heard Beni was a ninja\nthis whole time! But no matter what, he’ll always\r\nbe my dear friend.[VAR 0114(006E)]

I heard that in some far-off regions, people\nchallenge each other to battles using the\r\nPokémon they’ve caught![VAR 0114(003F)]
Won’t people from nearby regions come to\nhelp us?[VAR 0114(003F)]
The more people that have partner Pokémon, the\nmore people that’ll make them battle. You’ll see![VAR 0114(003F)]
I’m worried that Piplup might collapse again if I\nleave it alone. I’ll take good care of it back in\r\nthe village.[VAR 0114(003F)]
Heading outside the village, are we? Stay safe\nout there, kid.[VAR 0114(0030)]
I’m hearing reports of one of those mass\noutbreaks out there. Stay safe, kid.[VAR 0114(0030)]
I got myself apprenticed to the Supply Corps,\nbut going out there to collect materials...\c\nOooh, it leaves me scared half to death! How do\nfolks keep themselves safe from wild Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0041)]
Time and space all getting wonky... How is such a\nthing even possible?![VAR 0114(0041)]
I saw the most unbelievable things! Or maybe not\n“saw”... Maybe more like “experienced”?\c\nEither way, I’m thinking I’ve got to tell the world\nabout what happened to me.[VAR 0114(0041)]

You know, we had people back in Kanto who\nalso were able to tame Pokémon. They knew\r\nwhat they were doing in battles, too.[VAR 0114(0042)]
What in the world are Pokémon really?! How do\nyou explain this madness?![VAR 0114(0042)]
Well, I guess there’s a good reason why legends\nbecome legends, if you follow me.[VAR 0114(0042)]
The professor was nattering on to me about how\nPokémon evolve and then they look different...\c\nWhat about Burmy, though? They already look\ndifferent. What happens when they evolve?[VAR 0114(0042)]
Abaaa.
Mr. Mime taught me that not all wild Pokémon\nneed to be feared![VAR 0114(0045)]
Finally! I made it to Hisui! A brave new world...\nin which to hunt for more mushrooms![VAR 0114(002E)]
I’ll find every last mushroom there is in Hisui.\nSo you find every last Pokémon there is, pal![VAR 0114(002E)]
I’m the famous mushroom hunter Morel, and\nyou’d do well remember that—I’m a real fun guy![VAR 0114(002E)]
The famous mushroom hunter Morel...is thinking\nabout mushrooms even at a time like this!\c\nAfter all, the world could end any minute now!\nI can’t let my last chance at mushrooms molder![VAR 0114(002E)]
If I had a partner Pokémon of my own, I’d sure\nfeel a lot safer going out to pick mushrooms.[VAR 0114(002E)]
Could it be that...the mushroom is what’s really\nin control...? N-no, surely not...[VAR 0114(002E)]
Swinub’s got a real knack for rooting out some\nswell mushrooms, wouldn’t you say?\c\nI’d like to take one out for a bit of fungi-finding\nfun of my own one of these days...[VAR 0114(002E)]
Make sure folks see you using that mushroom\nrecipe I gave you! Spread the good word, yeah?[VAR 0114(002E)]
You...definitely have a suspicious look about you![VAR 0114(002D)]
You’re the talk of the town, you know!\nEveryone’s aflutter about how such a suspici—\r\nI mean...how such a strong-looking stranger\r\nactually passed the trial to join the team![VAR 0114(002D)]
You fall right out of nowhere and start setting\nthings right when they’re falling apart...\r\nYou’re like the hero in some sort of play![VAR 0114(002D)]
Waka might be a pain in my neck, but he’s still\nmy little brother... I’ve got to keep him safe.[VAR 0114(002D)]
Waka’s been saying that he wants to join up\nwith the Galaxy Team once he’s old enough...\r\nIf that day comes, look after him, won’t you?[VAR 0114(002D)]
Do you think people often mistake Pokémon for\nother things, like I did with that will-o’-the-wisp?[VAR 0114(002D)]
You DO know about Commander Kamado, right?\nYou know, that he has no home to return to?[VAR 0114(004C)]
We’ve angered the Pokémon. Now this village\nwill end up just like the commander’s hometown.\r\nBurned to ashes until nothing remains...[VAR 0114(004C)]
If we don’t get along with the Pokémon around\nus, the sky might go all awful again like before...[VAR 0114(004C)]
Nosepass is ever so helpful—I certainly can’t\nthumb my nose at how much easier my work has\r\nbecome since you brought it to me, you dear![VAR 0114(0075)]
The more people gather, the more their dreams\nand discontent gather as well, filling a place...\c\nAnd among so many, surely some must carry\ngrievances against the Pokémon surrounding us.[VAR 0114(0065)]
After seeing that otherworldly sky stretched\nabove us, can anyone still find it within them to\r\nfeel any love for the Pokémon that bedevil us?[VAR 0114(0065)]
Pokémon are terribly frightening creatures...\nAnd yet...there are moments when I can look\r\nupon one and find something to love there.[VAR 0114(0065)]
Oooh, I simply can’t help myself when it comes\nto Master Beni’s potato mochi! They’re the whole\r\nreason I came to live in Hisui![VAR 0114(004A)]
D-do you think a Warding Charm will be enough\nto keep me safe from whatever this is?[VAR 0114(004A)]
It’s always good to have a satchel chock-full of\ncharms when setting out on a survey![VAR 0114(004A)]
[~ 283]
I hear tell that there are unusually large\nspecimens of Pokémon called “alpha Pokémon.”\c\nI have absolutely no interest in meeting such a\nmonstrous specimen. If I came across one,\r\nI would turn heel and run for all I was worth![VAR 0114(0063)]
What is the world coming to? This unnatural sky...\nWho knew there were yet worse things to fear\r\nthan those dreaded alpha Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0063)]
If only I could meet the kind of Pokémon I dream\nof... The kind that isn’t terrifically frightening...[VAR 0114(0063)]
I certainly didn’t realize that Pokémon’s tails\ncame in so many different varieties.\c\nIt was quite diverting to see all the different\nforms they take and how they move![VAR 0114(0063)]
Can I level with you? I didn’t so much “choose to\ncome here” as I “chose to leave where I was.”\c\nI was in a bit of hot water back home, y’see.\nBut boy, did I ever get the wrong end of the stick.\c\nWhat kind of place is Hisui to run away to? Can’t\nrun anywhere with all these wild Pokémon about.[VAR 0114(004E)]
This is a real sign, all right. My sins being visited\nback upon me.\c\nThat’s it. If we make it through this, I’ll become\na new man, I swear—start fresh, be good, all that.[VAR 0114(004E)]
Once this hubbub’s all settled, I’m headed home\nto face the music. Time to do right by those folks\r\nI wronged...\c\nCan’t believe I thought I could steal someone\nelse’s lunch and simply get away with it![VAR 0114(004E)]
So those little ’uns come in different cloaks, but\nthey’re Burmy just the same.\c\nGuess that’s not too different from us Galaxy\nTeam folk, all coming from different places.[VAR 0114(004E)]
Nothing fazes me—I’m the cool, collected type.\nI came to see if Hisui’s as dangerous as they say.[VAR 0114(0052)]
Nothing fazes me... I’m the cool, collected type...\nBut aaagh, that creepy sky is too much!\r\nI can’t bear it![VAR 0114(0052)]
Well, I survived that creepy sky, so...NOW I can\nsay nothing’ll ever faze me![VAR 0114(0052)]
This ought to help poor little Conlan get over his\nfear of ghosts! I feel much better...er, knowing\r\nhe’ll be better.[VAR 0114(0052)]
I’m worried about the state of things here in\nJubilife Village. We lack basic necessities, and\r\nthere are some strange people around...[VAR 0114(0054)]
You’re the new Survey Corps recruit, are you?\nWell, good luck with it all.[VAR 0114(0054)]
Seems the Survey Corps struck gold when they\nfound you. Keep studying those Pokémon![VAR 0114(0054)]
You’re going to...“investigate” what’s happening?\nI hope that means you’ll actually SOLVE it...[VAR 0114(0054)]
I suppose the more you study, the more\nyou’ll discover.[VAR 0114(0054)]
Ahhh, I love the herbs that Tangela gave me!\c\nTheir smell’s lovely and cool—like taking a\ndeep breath in the middle of a thick forest.\r\nBrings back fond memories of home...[VAR 0114(0054)]
Strange places aren’t so bad if you’ve got family\naround, but you... Is there nobody here that\r\nyou know?[VAR 0114(0055)]
I only lately found a home here, too. Glad to\nhave you.[VAR 0114(0055)]
Doing nothing but work will wear a body and\nsoul right down.\c\nWe may be far from civilization, but we ought to\nat least have some music around here![VAR 0114(0055)]
I hear the woman who sells charms is doing\ngreat business now...[VAR 0114(0055)]
I wonder how Hisui will change as we people and\nPokémon intermingle...[VAR 0114(0055)]
Self-sufficiency’s the word in Jubilife Village!\nWhat we lack, we can only make for ourselves.[VAR 0114(0055)]
Just what kind of Pokémon is this “almighty\nSinnoh,” I wonder?[VAR 0114(002B)]
No matter the circumstance, you can’t be at your\nbest if you don’t eat! That’s why there’s always\r\ntime to cook.[VAR 0114(002B)]
There are so many ingredients to be found here\nin Hisui that’d be rare elsewhere![VAR 0114(002B)]
You’ve been a tremendous help. Geodude will be\na boon for these pickles![VAR 0114(002B)]
Oh, the dishes I might make with Octillery’s ink...\nMy creative spirit is ablaze![VAR 0114(002B)]
Geodude’s Evolution seems to have caused my\npickle recipe to evolve as well![VAR 0114(002B)]
Word of the Galaxy Team’s Survey Corps is\nstarting to trickle out to some far-off places.[VAR 0114(0066)]
Whenever I see the sky, I can’t help but heave a\nlittle sigh.[VAR 0114(0066)]
I’m trying to wipe away the memory of those\nfrightful times by going about my days normally.[VAR 0114(0066)]
Each of those Burmy certainly did have character.\c\nI suspect you might find other Pokémon species\nthat come in different forms, if you look...[VAR 0114(0066)]
Mercy, what a treasure this wide-open land is.\c\nI’m glad I followed my family out here and got to\nsee it. I doubt it’ll stay quiet and empty for long.[VAR 0114(0068)]
I tell you, the view outside is extraordinary. Like\nsomething a master would paint.[VAR 0114(0068)]
That strangeness in the sky helped bring the two\nclans and the Galaxy Team closer together.\r\nEvery cloud, as they say...[VAR 0114(0068)]
Pretty odd getup, stranger. What’re you doing in\nJubilife Village, anyway?[VAR 0114(0067)]
Listen, kid. If a wild Pokémon comes at you,\ndo two things: dodge it, and get outta there![VAR 0114(0067)]
Pokémon can be stronger than you or I’ll ever be.\nThat’s why we deal with ’em using smarts...\r\nand tools![VAR 0114(0067)]
This all goes to show that we’re powerless next to\nPokémon, in the end. Were from the start, even.[VAR 0114(0067)]
That kid Lian from the Pearl Clan was saying\nthere might be coal to be found around here.[VAR 0114(0067)]
I lost my home in a Pokémon attack. But then\nCommander Kamado kindly invited me to\r\ncome here.[VAR 0114(0058)]
The Pokémon must be angry... What could be\nangering it?[VAR 0114(0058)]
I hope to never again see people and Pokémon\npitted against one another.[VAR 0114(0058)]
I’m glad I found it in myself to keep Chimecho\naround. It was all thanks to your help.[VAR 0114(0058)]
I bet if I learn a lot about Pokémon, I can figure\nout the mysteries of the old tales, too![VAR 0114(006A)]
The sky’s all red! Is this some mysterious\nPokémon thing?[VAR 0114(006A)]
Dialga and Palkia are, um...“deities,” right?[VAR 0114(006A)]
I’m scared of Pokémon... I wish I’d never been\nbrought here...[VAR 0114(006C)]
You’re not scared of Pokémon?[VAR 0114(006C)]
Hey, how do you get a Pokémon to be\nyour friend?[VAR 0114(006C)]
The sky’s awful! It’s so scary![VAR 0114(006C)]
I was playing with some of the Pokémon in the\nvillage earlier![VAR 0114(006C)]
Hey, if you’re with Pokémon ever since you’re\nreally little, will they be your friend?[VAR 0114(006D)]
What made that hole in the sky?[VAR 0114(006D)]
Where do Pokémon come from?[VAR 0114(006D)]
Bwaaah!!![VAR 0114(0069)]
Hey, is it morning or night? Tell meee![VAR 0114(0069)]
Hey, how come Pokémon are so weird?[VAR 0114(0069)]
Hey, you know Magikarp? They jump! A lot![VAR 0114(0069)]
Gonna play with Pokémooon![VAR 0114(006B)]
You better stay at home! Outside isn’t safe![VAR 0114(006B)]
When can I go play outside the walls?[VAR 0114(006B)]
I’ve never seen clothes quite like yours, hon.\nWhere might they be from?[VAR 0114(001D)]
Hm. Worrisome.[VAR 0114(0091)]
You’re the new Survey Corps recruit? Hm.\nGood luck. Pull your weight.[VAR 0114(0091)]
I see you can get a job done. I hope we can\ncount on you to keep us safe.[VAR 0114(0091)]
There’s so much to be worried about that I’ve\nbasically given up worrying.[VAR 0114(0091)]
I see now why folks call the Survey Corps the\nPokémon problem solvers.[VAR 0114(0091)]
Wanda can be...careless. I’m a little worried\nabout whether she’s up to working with the\r\nSecurity Corps.[VAR 0114(0091)]
Thank you for finding Wanda again! I wish I were\nstrong enough to face Pokémon like you do.[VAR 0114(0091)]
Wanda really looks up to you now! She talks\nabout you glowingly.\c\nAs her brother and supposed role model,\nI have...mixed feelings. But good for you![VAR 0114(0091)]
You and Ursaluna have come to the rescue again.\c\nI can’t thank you enough for getting Wanda\nback—she’s my one and only sister.[VAR 0114(0091)]
Apparently, Wanda’s going to stick to guard duty\nhere in the village for a while.\c\nI can’t tell you how much I appreciate you going\nto all those lengths to save her.[VAR 0114(0091)]
We in the Security Corps certainly do patrol all\nover the place![VAR 0114(0070)]
When you need to stand up to a Pokémon,\nI suppose you bring another Pokémon! Right?[VAR 0114(0070)]
I wonder if there’s a Pokémon that could help me\nfind my way when I get lost.\c\nSomething like Captain Cyllene’s Abra, perhaps?[VAR 0114(0070)]
I guess Pokémon must get friendly with people\nbecause they really want to.\c\nIf they didn’t, they’d probably just escape the\npastures and run.[VAR 0114(0071)]
We’d never be able to conquer Pokémon.\nOur only hope is to become friendlier with them![VAR 0114(0071)]
I guess Pokémon must get friendly with people\nbecause they really want to.\c\nIf they didn’t, they’d probably just escape the\npastures and run.[VAR 0114(0071)]
Those Pokémon with two tail fins are so beautiful!\nI wonder if any of them would come live in the\r\nMilkiwa River...[VAR 0114(0071)]
If we’re short on labor, maybe we can ask some\nPokémon to lend a hand...[VAR 0114(0097)]
Just what kind of power lies hidden in Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0097)]
Am I right that there’s a Pokémon called Bonsly?\nI feel an urge to get to know one.[VAR 0114(0097)]
Machoke’s been great to work with.\c\nHaving help from Pokémon could open up a\nworld of building possibilities for the village.[VAR 0114(0097)]
I was invited here to join the Security Corps.[VAR 0114(00DB)]
When Pokémon react to you by attacking,\nare you making sure to dodge their moves?[VAR 0114(00DB)]
When you face a strong Pokémon, focusing on it\nis vital![VAR 0114(00DB)]
The villagers are ill at ease. Please hurry and\ninvestigate what’s happening![VAR 0114(00DB)]
Showing people that Pokémon can be our helpful\npartners is one of my duties.[VAR 0114(00DB)]
[~ 375]
I’ll do my utmost to be of use to the\nSecurity Corps![VAR 0114(00DA)]
When you encounter a wild Pokémon, the first\nthing you should do is focus on it.[VAR 0114(00DA)]
Approaching Pokémon from behind is a useful\ntactic. It works on the stronger ones, too.[VAR 0114(00DA)]
I want to do my utmost to help as a member of\nthe Security Corps, but...what should I do?[VAR 0114(00DA)]
I believe having Pokémon battle one another\ncould open many possibilities![VAR 0114(00DA)]
[~ 381]
Do Pokémon fight among themselves? Or are\nthey more inclined to help each other?[VAR 0114(0099)]
Can a Pokémon that can do this to the sky really\nbe caught with a ball?[VAR 0114(0099)]
If we can figure out how the Origin Ball works, do\nyou think we might be able to create a perfect\r\nPoké Ball that could catch any Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0099)]
Don’t you think Blissey resembles Pesselle?\nThey both help anyone in need, and then\r\nthere’s that particular shade of pink...[VAR 0114(0099)]
Up on the third floor is the office of the Galaxy\nTeam’s commander, Kamado.\r\nYou’re not going up there until we know a little\r\nmore about you, mystery kid.[VAR 0114(009D)]
Commander Kamado’s office is on the third floor.\nKeep up the good work, new kid![VAR 0114(009D)]
I’m Rye. I’m an Agriculture Corps member, and\nyes, it is a bit odd that I would be working here.[VAR 0114(009F)]
You can handle this. I don’t know how I know\nthat, but I know it.[VAR 0114(009F)]
I’ll be training with Lucario, then.[VAR 0114(009F)]
Alola![VAR 0114(009B)]
What could cause Pokémon to fly into a frenzy?[VAR 0114(009B)]
Just what could be on the other side of the\nspace-time rift?[VAR 0114(009B)]
The Alabaster Icelands remind me of\nMount Lanakila.[VAR 0114(009B)]
Are you gonna join the Security Corps, too?[VAR 0114(0085)]
So you’re the Survey Corps’ newest member!\nLet’s both do our best for the sake of the village.[VAR 0114(0085)]
I heard about how strong you are. Sure you\nwouldn’t be better off in the Security Corps?[VAR 0114(0085)]
Our captain’s no match for the Pokémon atop\nMount Coronet, and neither is the commander.[VAR 0114(0085)]
I feel as if the Security Corps’ row of quarters is\nstarting to look a little...rustic.[VAR 0114(0085)]
Yes? Can I help you? If you need something,\nI suggest you try asking at headquarters.[VAR 0114(008F)]
You’ve passed your trial, I hear?\c\nGoodness! Are you going to start catching all\nkinds of Pokémon now?[VAR 0114(008F)]
I’ve heard that Pokémon called nobles are\nflying into frenzies all over Hisui...[VAR 0114(008F)]
I know I’m part of the Security Corps, but I’m so\nfrightened I’ve just been quaking in my quarters...[VAR 0114(008F)]
It’s not that I never leave my quarters—you just\nonly see me when I’m off duty.[VAR 0114(008F)]
Um, these are Construction Corps quarters.[VAR 0114(008C)]
Hello there, new Survey Corps recruit. Pleased to\ncount you as a teammate.[VAR 0114(008C)]
Hello there, new Survey Corps recruit. I hear\nyou’ve proven yourself immensely capable.[VAR 0114(008C)]
Hello, new— Pardon me. I mean seasoned and\nskilled Survey Corps member. The fate of the\r\nvillage is in your hands now.[VAR 0114(008C)]
I’ve been pondering lately whether any Pokémon\nmoves could be of help with construction work.[VAR 0114(008C)]
You’re a newcomer, right?\c\nIf you have to go out and get close to Pokémon,\nyou’d better do it stealthily.[VAR 0114(0075)]
Aha—you’re with the Survey Corps now, if I’m\nnot mistaken? Let me offer you a tip.\c\nIf you’re out gathering materials, be sure to make\ngood use of your Crafting Kit.[VAR 0114(0075)]
I suppose the Supply Corps ought to change how\nwe do things so people don’t put themselves in\r\nharm’s way gathering materials.[VAR 0114(0075)]
You wouldn’t happen to be here to join the\nSupply Corps, would you?[VAR 0114(008B)]
Welcome to the team. My grandpa Tao Hua is in\ncharge of the Supply Corps. Perhaps you’ll work\r\ntogether at some point.[VAR 0114(008B)]
Make sure you’ve got the items you need when\nyou’re out to research a strong Pokémon.[VAR 0114(008B)]
We’ve got to get back to our normal lives!\c\nAnd that means we’ll need Grandpa to keep on\ncrafting lots of items.[VAR 0114(008B)]
I’d like to expand our shop to keep pace with\nhow Jubilife Village is growing.[VAR 0114(008B)]
I tell you, there’s nothing like a Berry![VAR 0114(0096)]
If you spot a Berry tree, have your Pokémon go\ngather some Berries from it![VAR 0114(0096)]
Those balms were made from the noble’s favorite\nfoods, right? Their fragrance seemed to hold\r\nsome mysterious power...[VAR 0114(0096)]
Now, I’ll sing Berries’ praises all day, but...I have\na feeling that the Pokémon atop Mount Coronet\r\nwon’t likely be tempted by ’em.[VAR 0114(0096)]
I bet there are even more types of Berries out in\nthis great wide world...and I’d like to gather them\r\nall here in Hisui![VAR 0114(0096)]
Don’t tell me you’ve been wandering around in\nthose flimsy clothes. You might want to stay here\r\nin the village, or else you could get hurt...[VAR 0114(00A0)]
So you’ve joined the Survey Corps! Don’t forget\nto carry some Berries and Potions with you.[VAR 0114(00A0)]
Make sure to show the Pokémon who’ve fought\nalongside you that you appreciate them.[VAR 0114(00A0)]
I’ll give my own life to save lives, if it comes to\nthat...but I hope nobody heading up Mount\r\nCoronet will need such care in the first place.[VAR 0114(00A0)]
Wouldn’t things feel safer if there were places all\nover where you could go for medical care?[VAR 0114(00A0)]
You might do well to talk to lots of folks. See\nwhat you can learn.[VAR 0114(00A1)]
Good luck, new recruit. Show us what you’re\nmade of.[VAR 0114(00A1)]
Are you all right? And is Kleavor? I hope you’re\nnot getting involved with risky survey work...[VAR 0114(00A1)]
I suppose sometimes there’s risky survey work\nyou just have to do.[VAR 0114(00A1)]
You may be able to heal your Pokémon with a\nPotion anytime, but all the same, don’t push\r\nthem too far.[VAR 0114(00A1)]
We’ve got to do more surveying to learn about\nthe areas all around Jubilife Village.[VAR 0114(0088)]
So you’re with the Survey Corps now. What d’you\nthink of our base camps? Handy, aren’t they?[VAR 0114(0088)]
We’ve got to scout out more locations where we\ncan build base camps.[VAR 0114(0088)]
I never thought the Summit Camp up on Mount\nCoronet would become our frontline base in an\r\nemergency like this.[VAR 0114(0088)]
I’ve been venturing out all over Hisui, and there\nreally are some odd Pokémon out there.[VAR 0114(0088)]
I heard you caught some Pokémon—is it true?\nOh, uh, not that I want to see them out of their\r\nPoké Balls or anything. I’ll take your word for it.[VAR 0114(0086)]
You’re going to survey Pokémon, huh? Going to\nfind out all the ways they’re terrifying?[VAR 0114(0086)]
Battling with Pokémon?! That’s the most terrifying\nidea I’ve ever heard![VAR 0114(0086)]
This whole calamity’s got to be the work of some\nPokémon, right?[VAR 0114(0086)]
Will we all end up walking around with Pokémon\nat our sides eventually? I just...can’t quite picture\r\nthat happening.[VAR 0114(0086)]
You must be plenty cold in those flimsy clothes.\c\nI mean, I can understand kids not letting a little\ncold stop them from playing outside...but you\r\nlook a fair bit older than that.[VAR 0114(008A)]
Passed your trial, have you?\c\nI’m impressed you can approach Pokémon. I’d\njust turn and run from those scary beasts.[VAR 0114(008A)]
You Survey Corps folks are doing amazing work.\c\nFolks around the village have all been reading\nstuff from that Pokédex lately.[VAR 0114(008A)]
I hope those folks out in the Pearl Settlement are\ndoing all right...[VAR 0114(008A)]
Setting up a base camp is hard work, you know.\c\nWe put in a lot of effort choosing places where it\nwon’t destroy Pokémon’s habitats if we build.[VAR 0114(008A)]
Hey, um, where’d you come from? Your clothes\nlook kinda weird.[VAR 0114(004D)]
Whoa, you joined the Survey Corps? Cooooool.[VAR 0114(004D)]
I heard Kleavor protects the Pearl Clan.[VAR 0114(004D)]
Wh-what’s gonna happen to us?[VAR 0114(004D)]
Hey, um, where’d you come from again? Are you\ngonna...go back?[VAR 0114(004D)]
Krooo!
Rowlet seems to be enjoying itself.
Would you like to bring Rowlet with you?
Fooom!
Cyndaquil seems to be having a pleasant time.
Would you like to bring Cyndaquil with you?
Plish plash.
Oshawott seems to be doing just fine.
Would you like to bring Oshawott with you?
Not now. You’d better head to the Wallflower.
Not now. You’d better head to the quarters\nyou’ve been assigned for tonight.
This chest looks like you could store lots and lots\nof items in it.
This must be some kind of workbench.
Now who might you be? I haven’t seen you here\nin the village before.[VAR 0114(001C)]
Are you looking for someone?[VAR 0114(0050)]
It’s gotten late. Better get into your futon and go\nto sleep.
It’s a full-length mirror.
You should get ready and head outside.
You can’t go any farther right now!
Can I interest you in a candy?[VAR 0114(004F)]

The more energy a Pokémon’s got, the harder it’ll\nbe to catch...\c\nIf you battle a Pokémon and lower its HP—or\nmaybe inflict paralysis with a move like Shinx’s\r\nThunder Shock—it should be easier to catch.
You should have your Pokémon smash open\nsparkling rocks for you!\c\nYou’ll find Tumblestones inside—the same\nTumblestones you need to craft Poké Balls.
Have you ever come across a tree shaking\nand swaying?\c\nI suspect that’s because Pokémon are up in the\ntree, feasting on all its Berries.
I hear there are Pokémon you can only spot\nat night...\c\nAnd sometimes, they’ll just...appear quietly, with\nno warning. Pretty creepy, if you ask me...
If you’re going near Floaro Gardens, keep your\nwits about you! The Pokémon out there hit so\r\nhard, they made my life flash before my eyes.\c\nI recommend starting with the Horseshoe Plains if\nyou’re looking to complete research tasks.[VAR 0114(006F)]
You never know what kinds of Pokémon you’ll run\ninto...so bring different kinds of Pokémon along!\c\nOur team member stationed at base camp can\nhelp you swap what Pokémon you’re carrying.[VAR 0114(006F)]
Don’t cross this bridge...unless you want to\nabridge your lifespan!\c\nSeriously, though. I’m stopping you for your\nown good.
There are many strong Pokémon that make their\nhome on the other side of this bridge!\c\nI can’t let you pass unless you’re a First Star\nrecruit—then you’d probably be all right.
On your entry trial, are you? Stay alive!\nAnd good luck passing, too!
If you’re feeling worn out, have a rest in a tent at\none of our base camps.\c\nYou can also rest there to pass some time. If it’s\nnighttime and you’re scared to be out surveying,\r\nthe tent is a fine option.
I came to try and get a look at Kleavor, but that\nalpha Bibarel’s moves are hard to get by.
Dodging is everything! Everything!\c\nWhen a wild Pokémon’s lashing out at you with\nits moves, you dodge right out of the way!\c\nWhile you’re dodging, their moves will whiz\nright by and not hit you!

Rumor has it you Galaxy Team folk are making a...\nPokédex? I’d sure love to see it when it’s done.[VAR 0114(00AE)]
It must be pretty rough for you, being expelled\nfrom the Galaxy Team and all.[VAR 0114(00AE)]
I can’t tell you how much fun the Harmony\nFestival was. It really got my blood pumping![VAR 0114(00AE)]
I hear someone in the Galaxy Team calmed\nLord Kleavor by defeating him in battle...\c\nI wonder if almighty Sinnoh will be angry.[VAR 0114(00B2)]
Something’s wrong with the sky... Is it because\nthe Galaxy Team quelled all the frenzied nobles?[VAR 0114(00B2)]
I’m going to stay in Jubilife Village for a while\nto learn more about making medicine.[VAR 0114(00B2)]
Legends tell of an ancient hero of Hisui who had\nten trusted Pokémon companions.\c\nThis was long before our clans arrived in this\nregion, mind you.[VAR 0114(00B6)]
Whether it’s strange lightning or strange people,\nnothing good can come out of a hole in the sky![VAR 0114(00B6)]
Do you think our clan could learn to use those\nPoké Balls of yours?[VAR 0114(00B6)]
We of the Diamond Clan revere almighty Sinnoh.\n...But the Pearl Clan claims the very same thing.\c\nWhat could this possibly mean?[VAR 0114(00B9)]
I’m sorry we couldn’t offer you a place to stay...\nWe can’t afford to antagonize the Galaxy Team.[VAR 0114(00B9)]
You didn’t just save the Galaxy Team—you saved\nour clan as well! Thank you so much![VAR 0114(00B9)]
A rift has opened up in the sky...\nSure hope it’s not some sort of ill omen...[VAR 0114(00BC)]
All my clan can do right now is wait for almighty\nSinnoh’s anger to pass. But I suppose you might\r\nbe able to help us...?[VAR 0114(00BC)]
The moon has set, and the sun rises in turn.\nTime flows on, and all is right in the world.[VAR 0114(00BC)]
Time flows forever onward thanks to the grace\nof almighty Sinnoh.[VAR 0114(00BE)]
I heard almighty Sinnoh descended to Mount\nCoronet from the heavens. Can it be true?[VAR 0114(00BE)]
Dialga, once created,\nbrought time into being.\c\nBe it in laughter or in tears,\nthe same time flows on.\c\nSuch is the blessing of Dialga.[VAR 0114(00BE)]
Did you know Adaman is Mai’s little brother?\c\nWell, they’re not really related, but they’re\nsiblings all the same. And I’m their littlest sister![VAR 0114(00C0)]
You’re from the Galaxy Team, right? Go see\nwhat’s happening at Mount Coronet! Please![VAR 0114(00C0)]
Surveying is so cool! I wanna survey stuff, too.[VAR 0114(00C0)]
Clover used to be in the Survey Corps of the\nGalaxy Team... Wonder what she’s doing now.[VAR 0114(00C2)]
The red sky is really scary...[VAR 0114(00C2)]
Dialga is way stronger than Palkia![VAR 0114(00C2)]
In the Diamond Clan, we make curatives using\nMedicinal Leeks and the like, sure.\c\nBut I hear the Galaxy Team knows how to craft\na huge variety of useful items! Seems we need to\r\nget with the times...[VAR 0114(00AF)]
Are you really strong enough to take on almighty\nSinnoh? You’re not the ancient hero, you know![VAR 0114(00AF)]
There’s a Poké Ball capable of catching almighty\nSinnoh? The mind reels...[VAR 0114(00AF)]
Whenever wild Pokémon attack, we summon\nLady Lilligant and rely on her for protection.\c\nNot much we can do by ourselves against\nPokémon, after all.[VAR 0114(00B0)]
Our leader, Adaman, talks about you a lot![VAR 0114(00B0)]
Now I finally understand Adaman’s desire to see\nwhat the future holds. Or, at least, I think I do.[VAR 0114(00B0)]
Some Pokémon are naturally friendly toward\nhumans! We live together with Pokémon like that,\r\nand we try to help each other out.[VAR 0114(00B1)]
Now that I think about it, you also fell out of that\nrift in the sky, didn’t you?[VAR 0114(00B1)]
Wow, you’re something else! Thanks for showing\nus what people and Pokémon can accomplish\r\nwhen we work together![VAR 0114(00B1)]
I hear the Celestica Flutes were gifts bestowed\non us by almighty Sinnoh way, waaay back when.[VAR 0114(00B3)]
Not even the noble Pokémon, in all their power,\nwould stand a chance against almighty Sinnoh\r\natop Mount Coronet.[VAR 0114(00B3)]
I wonder if almighty Sinnoh gave us the Celestica\nFlutes in hopes that they would bring us closer\r\nto Pokémon...[VAR 0114(00B3)]
...Poké Balls? And they’re for catching Pokémon?\nGosh, what a terrifying idea.[VAR 0114(00B4)]
Given the state of things, I just wish time would\nstop... I’m not ready for the end of the world![VAR 0114(00B4)]
The Galaxy Team has given us so many new\nideas. Like befriending Pokémon using those\r\nPoké Balls, for example![VAR 0114(00B4)]
It makes sense that young people are drawn to\nanything rare and mysterious...\r\nThose things really spice up your life, after all![VAR 0114(00B5)]
Is it true you’re planning to climb Mount Coronet\nwith your Pokémon?[VAR 0114(00B5)]
How can you catch Pokémon with something as\nsmall as a Poké Ball? How does that work?[VAR 0114(00B5)]
I wish I had a Pokémon buddy that would defend\nme if I got attacked by Pokémon out in the wilds...\c\nBut what Pokémon would ever fight by my side?[VAR 0114(00B7)]
There’s all sorts of Pokémon out there. Some are\nstrong...others not so much![VAR 0114(00B7)]
The Pokémon in our settlement might not seem\nlike the reliable sort, but their attacks sure pack\r\na punch![VAR 0114(00B7)]
Our clans both revere a different almighty\nSinnoh, but if they’re both the real deal...\c\nthen this dispute with the Pearl Clan would be\na huge waste of time...[VAR 0114(00B8)]
It’s time we buried the hatchet and worked\ntogether with the Pearl Clan. This conflict has\r\ngone on for far too long.[VAR 0114(00B8)]
Everyone has high hopes for the future. But we\nmustn’t forget that our future is built on the past.[VAR 0114(00B8)]
Looking at the Galaxy Team’s new way of life,\nyou can really feel the times are changing...\c\nAt least, that’s what Arezu always said![VAR 0114(00BA)]
Arezu has always looked up to the Galaxy Team,\nbut can they do anything to save us?[VAR 0114(00BA)]
Arezu’s working at the hairdresser’s in Jubilife\nVillage, right? Maybe I’ll drop by for a haircut...[VAR 0114(00BA)]
Time helps us to learn and grow—that’s what\nwe’re all told.\c\nBut time also causes us to age and eventually die.\nJust something to think about.[VAR 0114(00BB)]
Each day we live is another day closer to death...\nBut I never imagined it would end like this.[VAR 0114(00BB)]
I’m alive, and I feel like a new woman!\c\nThere’s so much I want to learn from the Pearl\nClan and the Galaxy Team![VAR 0114(00BB)]
Thanks to the noble Pokémon, we’ve finally\ngained some semblance of a normal life here.\c\nBeen a long time coming—I’ll tell you that.[VAR 0114(00BD)]
So, just like that, our peaceful life is gone...?\nWhat did our clan even accomplish in the end?[VAR 0114(00BD)]
Hrrrm...I see. If we work together with Pokémon\nas our partners, we won’t need to be so reliant\r\non the protection of the nobles.[VAR 0114(00BD)]
Young Adaman is in a tricky position, oh my, yes.\c\nHe has never seen nor heard almighty Sinnoh,\nyet we rely on him to lead our clan.\c\nI wonder... Is he truly up to the task?[VAR 0114(00BF)]
Have the Diamond and Pearl Clans enraged\nalmighty Sinnoh with our endless conflict?[VAR 0114(00BF)]
The incident at Mount Coronet seems to have\ngiven young Adaman more of a commanding\r\npresence... Or is that just my imagination?[VAR 0114(00BF)]
Our duty in the Diamond Clan is to watch over\nthe flow of time and all the changes it brings...\c\nBut nothing actually ever changes around here.[VAR 0114(00C1)]
Adaman’ll save us! You’ll see! ...I hope.[VAR 0114(00C1)]
Whaaat? There’s a Pokémon even more amazing\nthan Dialga and Palkia?[VAR 0114(00C1)]
This one time, Ursaluna really helped me out by\nfinding an item I’d lost!\c\nSo I hope I can talk more with the Pearl Clan\npeople real soon...[VAR 0114(00C3)]
Is almighty Sinnoh mad at us...?[VAR 0114(00C3)]
Calaba let me ride Ursaluna the other day! It was\nsooo much fun![VAR 0114(00C3)]
Duck?
Shluuurp!
Ruh...
Teddiii!
Wild Pokémon drop their defenses if you throw\nspoiled Apricorns at them! I guess something\r\nlike that is enough to give anyone a shock.
I could’ve sworn one of the Pokémon in that mass\noutbreak was a different color from the others...
You know the Grit Dust and Grit Gravel that wild\nPokémon sometimes drop? You can use those to\r\ntrain up your Pokémon!
Want to send Pokémon to or from the pastures\nin Jubilife Village?
Pokémon’s moves become less likely to hit when\nused in foggy conditions.\c\nOf course, moves like Aerial Ace and Swift will\nstill hit every time.
Dodging is everything! Everything!\c\nWhen a wild Pokémon’s lashing out at you with\nits moves, you dodge right out of the way!\c\nWhile you’re dodging, their moves will whiz\nright by and not hit you!
Time started to move faster for Hisui when\nyou arrived.\c\nI feel big changes coming—even to the very way\nhumans and Pokémon relate...[VAR 0114(000A)]

You know Glameow? One of those skittish\nPokémon that runs away from humans real quick?\c\nIf you wanna catch Pokémon like that, Smoke\nBombs and Stealth Sprays are your friends.\c\nThey’ll help hide you from the keen eyes and\nears of even the scarediest wild Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0086)]
Poké Balls can’t reach Pokémon flying way up\nhigh... But Feather Balls are another matter!
Feather Balls fly pretty far, so they’re great for\ncatching Pokémon up in the sky.

Kleavor and the other noble Pokémon watch over\nand protect us humans...\c\nWhile Pokémon like Ursaluna let us ride them\nand take us far and wide across Hisui.\c\nBut did you know that these Pokémon are all\ndescendants of the ten companions of the\r\nancient hero of legend?[VAR 0114(00C4)]
Why would almighty Sinnoh do this to us?\c\nDidn’t it bestow power upon the noble Pokémon\nso they could aid humans?[VAR 0114(00C4)]
As long as the descendants of the noble\nPokémon live among us, that means we still have\r\nalmighty Sinnoh’s divine protection.[VAR 0114(00C4)]
Even Irida must have her doubts about how best\nto lead the Pearl Clan...[VAR 0114(00C8)]
It doesn’t matter how good a leader Irida is—\nshe’s no match for almighty Sinnoh![VAR 0114(00C8)]
Now that we’ve celebrated together with the\nDiamond Clan and Galaxy Team, I hope we can\r\nstay united in face of any future challenges.[VAR 0114(00C8)]
If we didn’t have Pokémon to help us, there’s no\nway we could survive in this frozen land.[VAR 0114(00CC)]
Sorry that our clan couldn’t offer you shelter, kid.\nWe had troubles of our own to be dealing with.[VAR 0114(00CC)]
I wonder if any of the Galaxy Team’s clever tools\ncan help us to stave off the cold.[VAR 0114(00CC)]
Some Pokémon can actually be very affectionate\ntowards humans.\c\nThey live and grow together with us, and even\nprotect us from wild Pokémon![VAR 0114(00CF)]
Oh, almighty Sinnoh... Do you intend to renounce\nall that there is in this world?[VAR 0114(00CF)]
If only we could grow to understand the wild\nPokémon of Hisui. Then we could roam the\r\nentire region without fear.[VAR 0114(00CF)]
After journeying to Hisui from across the sea, our\nancestors met almighty Sinnoh in this place.\c\nThat is why the Pearl Clan decided on this\nlocation for our new home.[VAR 0114(00D2)]
Almighty Sinnoh... What could have happened to\nanger you so?[VAR 0114(00D2)]
Palkia, once created, brought\nforth the many dimensions.\c\nAll things—alive or not alive—\narrive at the same space.\c\nSuch is the blessing of Palkia.[VAR 0114(00D2)]
Though Lord Avalugg may not move about much,\nhe keeps the wild Pokémon in check and watches\r\nover the safety of our settlement.[VAR 0114(00D4)]
A rift in space and time... What’s going to\nhappen to our world?[VAR 0114(00D4)]
Just how long does an Avalugg have to live to\nreach that colossal size?[VAR 0114(00D4)]
It’s hard gathering food out in these parts.\nNot much to find in the first place, I guess.[VAR 0114(00D6)]
Almighty Sinnoh is awesome!!! It made the sky go\nall red![VAR 0114(00D6)]
If we wanna grow stuff on our own fields like the\nGalaxy people, we’ll need help from Pokémon![VAR 0114(00D6)]
When a fiery Pokémon sits next to you, its flames\nget you all cozy and warm![VAR 0114(00D8)]
What kinda Pokémon is almighty Sinnoh?[VAR 0114(00D8)]
Do fire Pokémon and ice Pokémon like\neach other?[VAR 0114(00D8)]
Hmmm, maybe I should go trade for some tools\nat one of the Galaxy Team’s base camps...\r\nTheir handiwork is something else![VAR 0114(00C5)]
Seems the Galaxy Team are going to try and sort\nout this whole situation with almighty Sinnoh.\c\nBut this isn’t something you can solve with fancy\ntools and gadgets.[VAR 0114(00C5)]
That team of builders in the Galaxy Team...\nthe Construction Corps, was it? I’d love for them\r\nto build me a house.[VAR 0114(00C5)]
Ingo is unbelievably good at battling with\nPokémon, don’t you think?\c\nI mean, it’s like his knowledge about Pokémon\nis on a completely different level.[VAR 0114(00C6)]
Ingo went to check on our clan’s noble Pokémon.\nSure hope he’s all right out there![VAR 0114(00C6)]
I wonder... Where did Ingo come from?[VAR 0114(00C6)]
Snowy terrain reflects a lot of light, so it’s even\neasier to get sunburned here than at the beach!\c\nThough we don’t go about exposing much skin\nhere in this climate.[VAR 0114(00C7)]
One good thing about the red sky is that we\ndon’t need to worry about sunburn anymore![VAR 0114(00C7)]
Snow goggles protect your eyes from the light\nreflected off the snow![VAR 0114(00C7)]
I remember a girl with a Croagunk... She said\n“All the Pearl Clan does is sit around and\r\nwatch over boring old places!”\r\nand then she ran off into the wilds.\c\nI wonder what she’s doing now?[VAR 0114(00C9)]
Nowhere in Hisui is safe now... We’re all done for.\nCompletely doomed...[VAR 0114(00C9)]
That girl Coin from the Miss Fortune sisters...\nI guess she just has her own unique way of trying\r\nto find where she belongs.[VAR 0114(00C9)]
Irida was so young when her mother left us, the\npoor girl can’t even recall her mother’s face.\r\nPerhaps that’s why she adores Palina so much.[VAR 0114(00CA)]
I know this isn’t really the time for idle\nobservations, but don’t you think that Irida\r\nhas a commanding presence?[VAR 0114(00CA)]
I’m glad Irida is our clan leader. Without her\nguidance, we would never have joined forces\r\nwith you or the Diamond Clan to challenge the\r\npower of almighty Sinnoh![VAR 0114(00CA)]
With love in your heart for almighty Sinnoh and\nwith your dear ones close at hand, you can live\r\njust about anywhere.\c\nThis is one of the Pearl Clan’s teachings.[VAR 0114(00CB)]
My love for almighty Sinnoh... Everything I’ve\nbelieved until now...[VAR 0114(00CB)]
Perhaps the time has come for the Pearl Clan to\nchange as well.[VAR 0114(00CB)]
If you hug one of those icy-looking Pokémon,\nyou can feel they’re actually a little warm!\c\nDo you think that’s because they have blood\nrunning in their bodies?[VAR 0114(00CD)]
So...almighty Sinnoh is a Pokémon...\nJust like...the Pokémon in our settlement?[VAR 0114(00CD)]
How should people deal with Pokémon in a\nworld that’s said to have been created by none\r\nother than a Pokémon?[VAR 0114(00CD)]
Irida is serious to a fault, but, well...she was\nchosen as our clan leader very young, after all.\c\nI think it would have been fine to entrust Palina\nwith that role for a little while.[VAR 0114(00CE)]
I’d feared that this whole mess would be too\nmuch for even Irida to handle, but...she’s been\r\ndealing with it surprisingly well![VAR 0114(00CE)]
I wonder if Irida’s horizons have broadened after\nmeeting you and that Adaman lad from the\r\nDiamond Clan.[VAR 0114(00CE)]
It’s a real pain getting hold of materials here in\nthe icelands. We have to buy almost everything\r\nfrom the Ginkgo Guild.[VAR 0114(00D0)]
Surely the Ginkgo Guild has some sort of super\ngadget they can sell us to help in times like this?[VAR 0114(00D0)]
I wonder what Volo from the Ginkgo Guild is up\nto these days?[VAR 0114(00D0)]
It would sure feel a lot cheerier around here if\nnot for our ongoing feud with the Diamond Clan.[VAR 0114(00D1)]
It’s not just our settlement at risk here. At this\nrate, all of Hisui will be lost...[VAR 0114(00D1)]
We’ll protect our homes with our own power.\nIf we have Pokémon by our side, all the better.[VAR 0114(00D1)]
If only the founders of our clan had met almighty\nSinnoh somewhere a bit more safe or warm...\r\nI’m sure many of us could have lived longer.[VAR 0114(00D3)]
Is this really how you want to go about meeting\nalmighty Sinnoh?[VAR 0114(00D3)]
I wonder if there was some deep meaning as to\nwhy our ancestors met almighty Sinnoh here.[VAR 0114(00D3)]
Young Irida started training to become the\nclan leader when she was barely out of infancy.\r\nShe’s never had anyone her age to play with.[VAR 0114(00D5)]
Why would almighty Sinnoh do this to us after\nwe revered and respected it so...?[VAR 0114(00D5)]
It’s true Irida never had playmates, but she\nalways had Glaceon by her side.[VAR 0114(00D5)]
Even we in the Pearl Clan might start moving to\nnew areas if our clan gets bigger![VAR 0114(00D7)]
I’m all good. I got everything sorted for if we\nneed to run.[VAR 0114(00D7)]
The potato mochi from the festival were\nsuper tasty![VAR 0114(00D7)]
I heard there’s a place called the “world’s end.”\nWhere is that?[VAR 0114(00D9)]
Is the world gonna end?[VAR 0114(00D9)]
I’m gonna go look for the world’s end together\nwith my Pokémon![VAR 0114(00D9)]
They say almighty Sinnoh watches over us from\nsomewhere beyond the skies.[VAR 0114(00DD)]
A Pokémon like that was living on the other side\nof the space-time rift this whole time?[VAR 0114(00DD)]
So almighty Sin— err...I mean Palkia and Dialga\nweren’t the Pokémon that created Hisui after all.[VAR 0114(00DD)]
Almighty Sinnoh created the world.\nSpace was then born from that creation.[VAR 0114(00DE)]
A deep red sky... Such is the power of the\nPokémon that birthed the world, I suppose.\c\nThough this is hardly the time to be impressed.[VAR 0114(00DE)]
So time and space were controlled by two\ndifferent Pokémon...[VAR 0114(00DE)]
Chop!
Plink!
Graaaaaa!
Nu...
Mmmmmm...
Zzzwiii...
[VAR BD06(0000)]The world before our eyes grows broader when\nwe achieve true understanding with Pokémon...\c\nThat’s a lesson I learned thanks to you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nI’ll cherish it.[VAR 0114(000B)]

This newfound feeling of camaraderie makes me\nwant to share something with you...like this!\r\nHere, a recipe for a delicious sweet treat![VAR 0114(004A)]

There are notes stuck here and there about\nPokémon species currently being researched.
It’s crammed cheek by jowl with publications and\nwritings on Pokémon!
It’s hard to guess what this is supposed to do,\nbut it certainly does look impressive...
There’s something written here: “I do solemnly\ndeclare that I shall record, in all due detail, the\r\nmodes of life of all the Hisui region’s Pokémon.”
You can read some of the Survey Corps’ notes...\c\n“Diligence is to be expected. Lenience is not.”
You can read some of the Agriculture\nCorps’ notes...\c\n“Current goals:\n･ Expand arable land area\r\n･ Secure more farmhands to meet labor demands\r\n(Could Pokémon be of use in this regard?\r\nUnder discussion.)”
You can read some of the Security Corps’ notes...\c\n“Captain Zisu commands that all members must:\n･ Be in perfect harmony with their Pokémon\r\n･ See whatever it is their Pokémon see\r\n･ Teach them the moves most suited to them”
You can read some of the Supply Corps’ notes...\c\n“Current goals: spreading the usage of common\ncrafting recipes and securing sufficient materials\r\nfor the village.\r\nStatus: In general, progressing favorably.”
The surface is covered with moss. Touching it\nfeels good somehow.
There is some kind of strange aura leaking out\nfrom the...cracks? Are they really just cracks?
There appear to be letter-like markings engraved\nin the stone surface...
It looks like the remains of someone’s campfire...
“Here rests the spirit of the Lord of the Isles,\nthe great and noble Arcanine”
You can feel a mysterious power from the ore,\nalmost like the very pulse of the land itself...
It’s a statue of one of the Pokémon that was said\nto have been loyal to the ancient hero...
It’s a statue of a Pokémon with an air of the\ndivine. Ancient people must have worshiped it...
It’s a statue of a Pokémon with an air of the\ndivine. Ancient people must have worshiped it...
It’s a statue of a Pokémon, but it’s been broken.\nAnd for some reason, it’s been left that way...
It’s a statue of a Pokémon, but who could have\nmade it—and how long ago...?

Kleavor, my mighty Lord of the Woods, seems\nto be in fine form today.\c\nAfter all, he’s managed to make that frenzied\nmight his own to wield![VAR 0114(0010)]
What have you come here to do?[VAR 0114(0010)]
Hmph. Got cold feet, did you?[VAR 0114(0010)]
[~ 13]
Very well![VAR 0114(0010)]
Your swiftest victory against my lord, Kleavor,\ntook you [VAR 0201(0000)]:[VAR 0201(0001)]:[VAR 0201(0002)].[VAR 0114(0010)]
[~ 16]
Not injured too badly, I hope? I took the liberty\nof tending to your Pokémon for you, at least.[VAR 0114(0010)]
My lord, Kleavor, is no easy opponent. Let me\nknow if you want to face him again.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Unbelievable![VAR 0114(0010)]
The time you took to triumph was [VAR 0201(0000)]:[VAR 0201(0001)]:[VAR 0201(0002)].[VAR 0114(0010)]
With that, you’ve set a new record. I suppose I\nshould offer my congratulations.[VAR 0114(0010)]
I think you deserve this reward.[VAR 0114(0010)]
And here’s something extra from me.[VAR 0114(0010)]
My lord, Kleavor, seems to enjoy his battles with\nyou. Should you wish to challenge him again,\r\nwe’ll welcome you anytime.[VAR 0114(0010)]
[~ 25]
The Lady of the Ridge is doing radiantly well.[VAR 0114(0011)]
So, child, what do you want to do?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Well, feel free to drop by again if you please.[VAR 0114(0011)]
[~ 29]
Then on behalf of Warden Arezu... Lady Lilligant!\nKindly honor this challenger with a battle![VAR 0114(0011)]
Your fastest time for achieving victory over Lady\nLilligant is [VAR 0201(0000)]:[VAR 0201(0001)]:[VAR 0201(0002)].[VAR 0114(0011)]
[~ 32]
Are you all right, child?[VAR 0114(0011)]
According to Warden Arezu, Lady Lilligant has\nbeen quite eager to battle you again.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Quite the performance.[VAR 0114(0011)]
You claimed this victory after [VAR 0201(0000)]:[VAR 0201(0001)]:[VAR 0201(0002)].[VAR 0114(0011)]
Well, that’s a new record. Impressive![VAR 0114(0011)]
Here, this is from me.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Take this, too.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Also, Warden Arezu had a message for you.\nShe said, “Please keep Lilligant company!”[VAR 0114(0011)]
[~ 41]
It seems Arcanine has settled into his role as lord\nquite nicely. He’s learned how to control his\r\nfrenzied might and can use it in battle at will.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Still, I’m sure you two could learn much from\neach other! What would you like to do?[VAR 0114(0014)]
Of course. It was lovely seeing you again all\nthe same.[VAR 0114(0014)]
[~ 45]
Certainly.[VAR 0114(0014)]
It seems your current record is [VAR 0201(0000)]:[VAR 0201(0001)]:[VAR 0201(0002)].[VAR 0114(0014)]
[~ 48]
Are you all right, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0014)]
Arcanine really has grown strong, hasn’t he?\nYou’ve both done so well getting this far.[VAR 0114(0014)]
That was a splendid match! I’m so proud of both\nyou and Arcanine.[VAR 0114(0014)]
This time, you defeated him in [VAR 0201(0000)]:[VAR 0201(0001)]:[VAR 0201(0002)].[VAR 0114(0014)]
How remarkable! You managed to best Arcanine\neven more quickly than before![VAR 0114(0014)]
Such an outstanding victory must be celebrated!\nPlease accept this gift from me.[VAR 0114(0014)]
And please take this as well.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Thank you, truly, for training together with\nArcanine. It means so much to us both.[VAR 0114(0014)]
[~ 57]
My dazzling lord, Electrode, is happily letting off\nsome pent-up electricity at present.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Let’s hear it, then. What are you here to do?[VAR 0114(0016)]
That might be the first smart decision I’ve seen\nyou make. So long, now![VAR 0114(0016)]
[~ 61]
If you must. Try not to get zapped...[VAR 0114(0016)]
The fastest time you’ve managed is [VAR 0201(0000)]:[VAR 0201(0001)]:[VAR 0201(0002)].[VAR 0114(0016)]
[~ 64]
Gosh, still in one piece, are we? I did warn you\nnot to bite off more than you could chew.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Well, no use crying about it. You can try again,\nbut prepare yourself well! Electrode is shockingly\r\nstrong, as you should know by now.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I can’t believe what I’ve just seen...[VAR 0114(0016)]
You took [VAR 0201(0000)]:[VAR 0201(0001)]:[VAR 0201(0002)] to win this battle![VAR 0114(0016)]
How on earth did you beat Electrode so quickly?\nI have to say I find myself a tiny bit impressed.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Here. A gift for you from the great Melli. Accept\nit with the honor it deserves.[VAR 0114(0016)]
And here. You somehow avoided each and every\nattack Electrode hurled at you, so I’ll give you\r\na prize for dodging your little heart out.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I suppose you’ll come trundling along for another\nrematch sometime, hm? We’ll be ready.[VAR 0114(0016)]
[~ 73]
Avalugg, mighty Lord of the Tundra, is ready to\nstorm and rage mightily once again today—just as\r\nhe did when he was struck by that odd lightning![VAR 0114(0017)]
What are you here to do?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Yes, that’s for the best. Avalugg is too strong to\nbe a simple sparring opponent.[VAR 0114(0017)]
[~ 77]
All right! Let’s put those muscles to work![VAR 0114(0017)]
Your fastest time to victory? Let’s see... That\nwould be [VAR 0201(0000)]:[VAR 0201(0001)]:[VAR 0201(0002)].[VAR 0114(0017)]
[~ 80]
That looked like a rough workout. I’ve gone\nahead and made sure your Pokémon are all right.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Avalugg is a formidable opponent. As his warden,\nI feel such awe at his vast and mighty power![VAR 0114(0017)]
You pulled off quite the feat besting my lord,\nAvalugg, in battle![VAR 0114(0017)]
It seems this time, you and your muscles emerged\nvictorious in [VAR 0201(0000)]:[VAR 0201(0001)]:[VAR 0201(0002)].[VAR 0114(0017)]
Well now, that’s a new record![VAR 0114(0017)]
You gave it your all out there, so here’s\nsomething from me.[VAR 0114(0017)]
And here—an extra reward. You’ve earned it![VAR 0114(0017)]
Seems you worked up a good sweat. Nice job!\c\nDon’t go repeating this to Avalugg, but I can tell\nhe’s excited to meet you in battle again soon.[VAR 0114(0017)]

Want us to plant some more crops for you?\nWhat kind of harvest shall we go for this time?[VAR 0114(001E)]

Just a bit more to go till harvest time! I can’t wait\nto see how the crop turns out![VAR 0114(001E)]

My word, what an\nodd person...
What manner of\ndress is that?!
Oh no, is [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she\ncoming this way?
Shhh! Quiet!\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe’ll hear you!
Keep walking,\nstranger!
Does the professor\nknow that child?
I’ve never seen that\nchild here before...
If you run out of balls,\ndo just say the word!
Hrmmm...\nThat one looks suspicious.
A newcomer to the village?
Who’s that with\nthe professor?
We’re not s’posed to talk\nto strangers, you know.
A new recruit for the\nSurvey Corps, maybe?
That’s quite the\noutfit right there...
Where’d you come from?
Fancy buying\na sweet treat?
A photo lasts a lifetime!\nHow about a sitting?
Shrine guardian,\nwatch over us...
Rare wares!\nOnly the best here!
Rare wares! Great deals!\nOnly the best here!
The bonds between\nPokémon and people...
Right, right—the\nSurvey Corps...
I’m so bored...\nI wish something would happen...
Yes, and then...
You don’t say!
The cleaning never\nstops around here...
You can play wherever you like,\nas long as it’s in the village, dear.
But I wanna go\noutside the walls!
I wonder what a\nStarly would like...
It’s rather pricey...\nI wonder if I can haggle?
Can Poké Balls be used to\ncollect mushrooms, too?
Pachiii!
Kikiki!
Raaav!
Croro?
Bud!
Now, where should\nwe target tomorrow...
I need some kind\nof easy mark to hit...
I’m bored. Wish there\nwere someone to rob...
Wurwurwur...

Mmph.
Zzzwine...
Nuwaaah.
Aim, throw, don’t stop!\nHit the targets, watch ’em pop!
Maybe if I had some—\nNo, no, that won’t work...
Is there something that people are\nafraid might come from the rift?
Anything! Anything coming out\nof a rift in the sky is scary!
Sure would love some help from\nsome strong, strapping type...
It’s covered in leaves!\nNot a rock in sight!
It definitely didn’t have trash stuck\nto it. Minerals! They’re minerals!
You’re both wrong. It’s trash.\nNo leaves, no stones. Trash.
When I’m a full team member,\nI’ll catch all the Pokémon!
It’s the [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl everyone’s\nbeen talking about!
All of ’em? How many balls\nwould you need to do that?
[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe’s the one with h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser own\nPokémon partner, right?
I wanna craft\nsomethin’, too!
C’mon! Lemme have\na turn craftin’, too!
What should we\nplay today?
Let’s play Pass the Time!
That’s just sitting around\nwaiting for time to pass!
Unusual to see a visitor\nhere at our settlement.
You’re part of that Galaxy Team?\nUnder that Kamado fellow?
W-welcome?
Here to see Adaman?
You’ve got all kinds\nof kit with you, hm?
Your parents will always be\nyour parents. No matter what.
I can’t wait\nto grow up!
Coming all the way out here\nto visit us in our cold home?
All this space around\nme is my space! Mine!
Well, my space is\nbigger, so there!
Let almighty Sinnoh pick\nwho’s got the bigger space!
That’s certainly true.
Any meeting in this vast world\nis something to be grateful for.
Irida is certainly\ngiving it her all...
Do you really have Pokémon\nin those little contraptions?
Almighty Sinnoh...\nWhat lies beyond the rift?
Hmm...
I oughta make a totally white trap\nso it blends in perfectly here!
Wh-what? What do you want?\nI’m not making any traps...
This view never changes...
It’s so white...
It’s the cutest Pokémon\nin all the world!
Those ears... Hrmmm...\nNo, I can’t recall them!
It’s still not enough!\nI need more than this...
A big Buizel...
Those darn Bidoof!
Hey! You there!
Where is he?!
Hey, listen! You are NOT\ngoing to believe what I saw...
Arghhh, that Tao Hua!
How to make Jubilife Village\na fashionable place to live...
...Psy?
Uuuck...
Ay-ay-ayyyy...
Wh-where could she be...?
This way? That way?\nWhich way was it again?
Oof! What a stench!
I’m talking about\nSudowoodo, o’ course!
De-le-le-le...?\nIs that how it goes?
I’ve got this real great\nmushroom recipe, see?
Did you take my\nCombee request?
That graceful\nPokémon...
But where could\nI have dropped it...?
That Pokémon with the tail fins...\nI’d like to get another look at it...
What a tail...
I just wanted to be helpful...
Honestly, where\ndid he get off to?
A t-t-talking Pokémon?!\nGyaaahhh! Help meee!
Halp me! Halp me!
[~ 136]
Tell me! Tell me!\nPleeeaaase!
Come on! Eat up!
Oooh... My back...
My hairstyles are\nbold and stylish!
The aroma of that herb...\nI still remember it...
Simply incredible!
[~ 143]
I’ve got to do something\nto get this camp set up!
Zooor...
[~ 146]
I wonder if Clefairy\ndance here in Hisui...
Aughhh! Pins and needles!\nI can’t even feel my feet!
This is it! I’ve come up\nwith the ultimate recipe!
Somewhere out there in all this\nsnow, there’re mushrooms!
I’m sure I saw the\nBlissey around here...

You can carry around even more in that satchel\nof yours if you learn the trick to packing things in.\r\nI can teach you, if you’d like. What do you say?[VAR 0114(009D)]
Want me to teach you my packing tricks?\nI’m happy to share them—for a price.[VAR 0114(009D)]
If you want to be able to carry even more things,\nthere’s more I could teach you. What do you say?[VAR 0114(009D)]
[~ 3]
That’s it! You’ve learned everything I could\npossibly teach you about packing, kid!\c\nMaybe I should set my sights on some new goal...\nlike a bag that can hold as many items as you like![VAR 0114(009D)]
Teach me!
Maybe later
I like your initiative! My teaching fee is a neat\n[VAR 0205(0000,002C)]. All right?[VAR 0114(009D)]
Yes, please
Never mind
Perfect! Then lend me your ear a moment...[VAR 0114(009D)]
...And that’s all there is to it! You see how much\nmore you can fit in by packing things rightly?[VAR 0114(009D)]
There’re times when a single extra item can mean\nthe difference between life or death, you know.[VAR 0114(009D)]
Zounds, would that I could teach you, but you’ve\ngot to pay my fee first. Come back when you can.[VAR 0114(009D)]
Come back if you ever want to learn. And try not\nto die out there before you do![VAR 0114(009D)]
You’ve made space to keep one more kind of\nitem in your satchel!

[VAR BD06(0000)]I must tell you, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nJourneying\r\nwith\r\nyou\r\nhas\r\ngiven\r\nme a new ambition.\c\nI wish to make the joys of battling Pokémon\nmore widely known in this world![VAR 0114(0015)]
And the first step to realizing that goal would be\nto host some spectacular Pokémon battles!\r\nI hope you’ll lend your talents to this effort.[VAR 0114(0015)]
I can call someone for you to battle, if you\nwould like. Who can I conduct here for you?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Bren
Wenton
Zisu
Rei
Akari
Kamado
Beni
You, Ingo
Not interested

Very well. If you would be so kind as to wait just\na moment, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0015)]
I understand. It’s only natural to wait to board\nuntil you have a destination in mind.\r\nI hope to serve you again![VAR 0114(0015)]
Whew. The prospect of battling someone with\nyour talent has me shaking...but feeling honored\r\nas well![VAR 0114(00DA)]
Your consummate battling has taught me what\ntruly matters. It’s not winning or losing—it’s\r\nworking in harmony with your Pokémon![VAR 0114(00DA)]
One glimpse is enough to understand just how\nmuch strength you and your Pokémon wield![VAR 0114(00DB)]
I suspect you and your Pokémon will only grow\nstronger yet...\r\nSo I must train diligently for my part as well![VAR 0114(00DB)]
Hey! It’s me, Zisu. We can skip the\nintroductions, right?[VAR 0114(001B)]
It seems like I was teaching you about agile style\nand strong style only yesterday, but now you’re\r\na true hero of Hisui![VAR 0114(001B)]
Having our Pokémon do battle is part of how we\nlearn about ’em![VAR 0114(0006)]
Battling’s great, of course...but I want to keep up\nour survey work and reach a point where if I meet\r\na strong Pokémon, we can come to understand\r\neach other even without battling![VAR 0114(0006)]
Here I am! Get ready to face my full power![VAR 0114(0007)]
Thanks for a fine battle!\c\nI think I understand Pikachu and the others a bit\nbetter now—and vice versa. Battling certainly has\r\nits merits...[VAR 0114(0007)]
Hrrrm! I’ve donned this traditional Galarian\narmor, and I trust you know what that means!\c\nI ain’t holdin’ nothin’ back for this battle![VAR 0114(0009)]
The way you battle—it’s as if it is the culmination\nof all your Survey Corps work. Continue to\r\nimprove your skills.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Doesn’t matter to me who wins and who loses.\nI’m here to show you how a ninja fights—\r\nthe style of a dying breed![VAR 0114(000E)]
S’pose I’ll go prepare some potato mochi.\c\nI’d probably better start coming up with some\nnew dishes, or everyone will get sick of these...[VAR 0114(000E)]
Now then... Follow the rules and drive safely!\nWe’re headed for victory! All aboard![VAR 0114(0015)]
Sometimes I find myself saying things without\nknowing where the words come from...\r\nyet those words seem to fill me with power.\c\nBut returning to the matter at hand:\nI hope you’ll challenge me again sometime.[VAR 0114(0015)]

Come speak with me anytime you want to have\na go! My balloons and I aren’t going anywhere!
I’ll give it a try!
I don’t think so
Could you explain?
Do you want to end your run?
I hope you come again for some more balloon-\nracing fun!
How about it, kid? Want to play?
You’ve moved away from the race course.\nDo you want to end your attempt?
Welcome back! You burst...[VAR 0201(0000)] balloon[VAR 1101(0000,0100)]s!
Well, I’m sorry—no prize for you this time...\nBut you’re always welcome to try again!
You’re still learning the ropes, looks like!\nThat’s all right—I’ve got a reward for you!
Not bad, not bad at all! For someone so skilled,\nI’ll offer this as a reward!
You’re so close to bursting them all! A little\nreward should help keep you motivated!
[~ 19]
Another perfect run! I see the balloon bursting\nboss still hasn’t lost h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser touch. Please, do accept\r\nyour reward!
P-perfection! You popped every single balloon!\c\nYou’re definitely a balloon-bursting boss—that’s\nfor sure. And that means you deserve something\r\nspecial to mark the occasion!
Your goal is to burst as many balloons as you can\nwithin the time limit!\c\nHow do you burst the balloons, you ask? Why,\njust charge into them while riding a Pokémon!\r\nDon’t burst them by throwing items—that’s\r\nagainst the rules.\c\nYou’ll get better rewards the more balloons you\nburst, so give it your best burst of energy!

Its insides are packed with gears and machinery\nthat serve some unclear purpose.[VAR 0114(0019)]

Hello there, Survey Corps recruit! Did you need\nsomething from me?[VAR 0114(001B)]
I want new moves
I want to exchange items
Nothing in particular
I want to master moves
I’ve got a question
Interested in an item exchange? What is it you’re\nin the market for?[VAR 0114(001B)]
What do you want to know?[VAR 0114(001B)]
[VAR 1303(0000,0000)][VAR 0109(0000)]
Never mind
About learning moves
About mastering moves
About using moves
About effort levels
Nothing
[VAR BD06(0000)]I can swap you one\n[VAR 010A(0000)]\r\nfor\r\n[VAR 0202(0002)] [VAR 1001][VAR 010A(0001)],\r\nif you want.[VAR 0114(001B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Or we could do a larger exchange, if you’d like.\c\nSay [VAR 0203(0001,002C)] [VAR 1001][VAR 010A(0000)] for\n[VAR 0203(0003,002C)] [VAR 1001][VAR 010A(0002)].\r\nSo, what’ll it be?[VAR 0114(001B)]
I’ll take one
A large exchange, please
Anything else you need?[VAR 0114(001B)]
What else can I do for you?[VAR 0114(001B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 1303(0002,0000)][VAR 0109(0002)]? Sure, if you have\n[VAR 0201(0001)] [VAR 1001][VAR 010A(0000)]\r\nto trade.\c\nBut it doesn’t look like you do...[VAR 0114(001B)]

So, which of your darling Pokémon do you want\nme to tutor?[VAR 0114(001B)]
Do you want me to look at any other of\nyour darlings?[VAR 0114(001B)]
Change
Quit
I can’t help your Pokémon master moves if you\ndon’t have [VAR 1302(0000,0000)][VAR 0109(0000)].[VAR 0114(001B)]
Hmm. Seems like [VAR 0102(0000)] doesn’t know\nany moves I can help with.[VAR 0114(001B)]
All right, then! So, which move do you want to\nhave [VAR 0102(0000)] master?[VAR 0114(001B)]
Change your mind? Take all the time you need to\nthink it through.[VAR 0114(001B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Then I’ll use [VAR 1302(0000,0000)][VAR 0109(0000)] to help\n[VAR 0102(0001)]\r\nmaster\r\n[VAR 0107(0002)].\r\nYou ready?[VAR 0114(001B)]
Master move
[VAR 0107(0000)]
Then here I go![VAR 0114(001B)]
Hyaaaaaa![VAR 0114(001B)]
[VAR 0102(0001)] mastered [VAR 0107(0000)]!
Perfect! Keep up with the training.[VAR 0114(001B)]
I can teach your Pokémon moves. Not for free,\nthough, mind you.\c\nBut I can even help them learn moves that they\nwouldn’t learn by leveling up.[VAR 0114(001B)]
Pokémon can master moves through leveling up.\nOnce a move is mastered, you can choose to\r\nhave your Pokémon perform it in the strong or\r\nagile style, see?\c\nAnd of course, if you give me a Seed of Mastery,\nI can help your Pokémon master a move, too.[VAR 0114(001B)]
Shouldn’t you know this already if you’ve battled\nPokémon before?\c\nYou start a battle, then you choose a move!\nIt’s up to you to choose whether you use one\r\nthat’ll be just plain effective or super effective\r\nor whether you might want to deliver a move in\r\nthe strong style or the agile style.[VAR 0114(001B)]
Raising your Pokémon’s effort levels will improve\ntheir stats, you see.\c\nYou can use items like Grit Dust to raise your\nPokémon’s stats, like Attack or Defense or what\r\nhave you.\c\nIt might give you the edge you need in battle.[VAR 0114(001B)]
Hey, I heard you raised your rank!\c\nNow I can teach your Pokémon some new moves.\nSo, what can I do for you?[VAR 0114(001B)]
Hey, I heard you raised your rank again!\c\nNow I can teach your Pokémon some more new\nmoves. So, what can I do for you?[VAR 0114(001B)]

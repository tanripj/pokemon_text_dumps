Checking Survey Tips
Survey tips contain all sorts of useful information to help you\ncarry out your survey work in the Hisui region.\n\nTo read them at any time, simply press the [VAR FF00(0006)]Up Button[VAR FF00(0000)] to open\nthe menu, then go to the Help screen.
Throwing Poké Balls
Pokémon can be caught by throwing Poké Balls at them.\n\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Hold down[VAR FF00(0000)] the ZR Button to ready a Poké Ball and take aim.\nYou can keep moving around as you do, so use the Right Stick\nto adjust your angle and aim carefully at your target Pokémon.
[VAR FF00(0006)]Release[VAR FF00(0000)] the ZR Button to throw the Poké Ball. If it hits a\nPokémon, you may be able to catch it.\n\nIf you’ve readied a Poké Ball but do not want to throw it,\npress the B Button to cancel the throw.
Starting Pokémon Battles
It’s easy to start a battle against a wild Pokémon—simply throw\na Poké Ball that contains one of your own Pokémon at it.\nIf you can see that you currently have an item readied to throw,\nnot a Pokémon, press the [VAR FF00(0006)]X Button[VAR FF00(0000)]. It will allow you to toggle\nbetween your thrown items and your Pokémon team.
The Secret Back Strike Technique
Hit a wild Pokémon from behind for a higher chance\nof a successful catch or to gain an advantage when\nstarting a battle.\n\nThis secret technique is called a [VAR FF00(0006)]back strike[VAR FF00(0000)].
Focusing in the Field
[VAR FF00(0006)]Hold down[VAR FF00(0000)] the ZL Button to focus on a wild Pokémon\nand keep it in your sights as long as it’s nearby.\n\nThis technique comes in very useful when aiming Poké Balls\nat a target or when dodging Pokémon’s attacks.
Take Cues by Focusing
When you use the ZL Button to focus on a Pokémon,\nyou can see how easy it may be to catch.\n\nThe more [VAR FF00(0006)]arrows [VAR FF00(0000)]you see pointing up above a Pokémon,\nthe easier it will be to catch.
An [VAR FF00(0006)]X icon[VAR FF00(0000)] will appear above a Pokémon if it has picked a\nfight with you.\n\nBe warned—Pokémon displaying this icon [VAR FF00(0006)]cannot be caught\nunless you engage them in battle[VAR FF00(0000)]!
Crouching Down
Press the B Button to crouch and make it harder for wild\nPokémon to notice you. Press the same button again to rise.\n\nIf you creep into the tall grass while crouched low, you’ll be\neven harder for wild Pokémon to detect.
Dodging Pokémon Attacks
When you press the Y Button to dodge, you’ll become\n[VAR FF00(0006)]invulnerable [VAR FF00(0000)]to Pokémon attacks for a brief moment.\nDodge with just the right timing to pass through incoming\nattacks without taking any damage!
The Dangers of Taking Damage
If you take too much damage within a short time, you’ll be\n[VAR FF00(0006)]in danger of blacking out[VAR FF00(0000)]. You can tell you’re in danger\nwhen the edges of the screen turn red.\nDamage goes away over time, but you won’t begin to recover\nif you’re still being targeted by a wild Pokémon.
If you take further damage after the edges of the screen have\nturned red, you’ll become overwhelmed and black out.
Research Tasks
Research tasks are [VAR FF00(0006)]tasks you need to carry out to complete the[VAR FF00(0000)]\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Pokédex[VAR FF00(0000)]. Each Pokémon species has a different number and\nvariety of research tasks. Press the Down Button to open your\nPokédex, then check what kinds of research tasks are available\nfor the Pokémon you’ve registered.
When you’ve focused on a wild Pokémon in the field using\nthe ZL Button, you can also [VAR FF00(0006)]instantly check[VAR FF00(0000)] the research\ntasks for that species by pressing the Down Button to open\nyour Pokédex right to that page. Some Pokémon have some\nunusual research tasks, so be sure to check them out.
Unown Research Notes
Press the Y Button while viewing the cover of your Pokédex to\njump to your Unown research notes.\n\nBy deciphering the cryptic symbols found in these notes, you\ncan try to find all the Unown hiding throughout the region.\n\nThese Unown possess a mysterious power that repels Poké Balls\ncontaining Pokémon, so you won’t be able to battle them, but\ntrack them down and catch them all if you can!
Earn Money for Survey Reports
When you submit survey reports, you’ll receive [VAR FF00(0006)]money[VAR FF00(0000)]\nbased on the level and number of Pokémon you’ve caught.\n\nYou’ll receive more money if you’ve fulfilled certain conditions,\nsuch as catching a species for the first time.
Completing the Pokédex
By carrying out research tasks and submitting survey reports,\nyou’ll raise the [VAR FF00(0006)]research levels[VAR FF00(0000)] of the Pokémon species you\nencounter. If you raise a Pokémon’s entry to [VAR FF00(0006)]level 10[VAR FF00(0000)], that entry\nwill be considered [VAR FF00(0006)]complete [VAR FF00(0000)]and you will have unlocked all of\nthe detailed information to be had about that species.
As you carry out tasks and complete the Pokédex entries for\ndifferent species, you’ll also gain [VAR FF00(0006)]Pokémon research points[VAR FF00(0000)],\nwhich you can view on the cover of your Pokédex.\nOnce you’ve earned a certain number of points, you’ll be able\nto move up through the ranks of the Galaxy Expedition Team.
The Map and Markers
Use the − Button to view the [VAR FF00(0006)]map[VAR FF00(0000)] on your Arc Phone.\n\nYou can consult the map for guidance to your next destination\nand information on your missions and requests.
You’ll also see [VAR FF00(0006)]guidance markers[VAR FF00(0000)] when you’re out exploring\nor running around the village.\n\nIf you’re not sure where to go next, stop and look around in all\ndirections to try to spot one of these markers, then head for it!
Instant Travel
Press the X Button while consulting the map on your Arc Phone\nto [VAR FF00(0006)]instantly travel[VAR FF00(0000)] to base camps and other locations.\n\nHowever, be aware that this feature might not be usable in\nsome situations.
Checking Missions & Requests
Press the Y Button while consulting the map on your Arc Phone,\nand you can check the tasks you have waiting. There are two\ntypes: missions and requests.\n\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Missions[VAR FF00(0000)] must be completed to progress in your adventure,\nwhile [VAR FF00(0006)]requests[VAR FF00(0000)] are optional and given by people you meet.
Accepting Requests
People who have something to ask you will have a [VAR FF00(0006)]request icon[VAR FF00(0000)]\ndisplayed above them.\n\nIf you fulfill their request, you may receive a nice reward.
Riding on Pokémon
Press the + Button to summon a Pokémon to ride on.\n\nBe sure to stay alert for wild Pokémon attacks and avoid\nfalls from high places while you’re riding about!
Digging for Treasure with Ursaluna
Ursaluna will rush toward any treasure he senses in front of him.\nPress the Y Button to [VAR FF00(0006)]dig for treasure[VAR FF00(0000)] when Ursaluna finds a spot\nthat makes him react particularly strongly. You might find\nsomething very nice!
Traversing Water with Basculegion
Press the + Button or A Button when you’re in the water\nto summon Basculegion and cross the water on his back.
While riding Basculegion, you’ll still be able to throw items.\n\nWhat’s more, when Basculegion jumps into the air, you’ll have\nmore time to adjust your aim before you throw.
Climbing with Sneasler
You can climb up and down cliffs, ledges, and other sheer\nsurfaces with Sneasler’s aid.\n\nTo summon Sneasler, press the A Button when you’re near a\nclimbable surface or use the + Button in any other location.
Soaring the Skies with Braviary
With Braviary, you can fly high up into the sky and explore the\ndifferent areas of Hisui from the air. You can summon Braviary\nusing the + Button wherever you may be, and you can also press\nthe A Button if you’re falling from some height to summon him\nin a flash.
Crafting Items
You can use the [VAR FF00(0006)]workbenches [VAR FF00(0000)]in Jubilife Village and the base\ncamps to craft Poké Balls and other items.\n\nCrafting items requires a recipe and the necessary materials.
Once you’ve acquired a [VAR FF00(0006)]Crafting Kit[VAR FF00(0000)], you can craft items\nwherever and whenever you like. However, unlike at a\nworkbench, you’ll only be able to use the materials in your\nsatchel, and you won’t be able to craft more items than\nyour satchel can hold.
The Crafting Kit
You can select the [VAR FF00(0006)]Crafting Kit [VAR FF00(0000)]from the Key Items pocket in\nyour satchel to craft items wherever and whenever you like.\nHowever, unlike at a workbench, you’ll only be able to use the\nmaterials in your satchel, and you won’t be able to craft more\nitems than your satchel can hold.
Evolving Pokémon
Some Pokémon can undergo Evolution, which changes their\nappearance and stats. If one of your Pokémon has met the\nrequirements to evolve, you’ll be able to select the [VAR FF00(0006)]Evolve\n[VAR FF00(0000)]option when viewing the Pokémon in your satchel.
Alpha Pokémon
Pokémon whose eyes glow red are called [VAR FF00(0006)]alpha Pokémon[VAR FF00(0000)].\n\nAlpha Pokémon are larger than others and may know\nmoves that are rare for their species. They appear to\nbe very difficult to catch.
Space-Time Distortions
[VAR FF00(0006)]Space-time distortions[VAR FF00(0000)] are dangerous places where\npowerful Pokémon appear.\n\nHowever, if you’re brave enough to enter them, you might\nbe able to find rare Pokémon and items inside.
Type Matchups
Both Pokémon and moves have [VAR FF00(0006)]types[VAR FF00(0000)]. The type matchup\nbetween a move and its target Pokémon determines how much\ndamage is taken. Moves can be super effective, effective, not\nvery effective, or completely ineffective.
Here are some examples of type matchups:\n\nFire-type moves are strong against Grass-type Pokémon.\nGrass-type moves are strong against Water-type Pokémon.\nWater-type moves are strong against Fire-type Pokémon.
Pokémon Moves
Pokémon sometimes learn new moves when they level up.\n\nIf you want to change the moves your Pokémon can use in\nbattle, open your satchel, choose the Pokémon you want,\nand select the [VAR FF00(0006)]Change moves[VAR FF00(0000)] option.
Action Speed in Battle
Press the Y Button during battle to check the [VAR FF00(0006)]action order [VAR FF00(0000)]of\nall the Pokémon currently battling. This shows the order in\nwhich Pokémon will take their upcoming turns, based on their\n[VAR FF00(0006)]action speed[VAR FF00(0000)].\n\nThe action speed of a Pokémon is based on its Speed stat,\nbut it can also be affected by certain moves and items.\nA Pokémon with a high action speed may be able to act multiple\ntimes in a row.
Agile Style and Strong Style Moves
Once your Pokémon has mastered a move, you can have it use\nthe move in either the [VAR FF00(0006)]agile style[VAR FF00(0000)] or [VAR FF00(0006)]strong style[VAR FF00(0000)] by pressing the\nL or R Button, or the Left or Right Button, when selecting the\nmove in battle.\n\nSometimes your Pokémon will naturally master a move and\nunlock these extra styles simply by leveling up.
Agile Style\n・Reduces the power of the move\n・Raises the user’s action speed\n・Uses more PP than usual\n\nStrong Style\n・Boosts the power of the move\n・Lowers the user’s action speed\n・Uses more PP than usual
Saving Your Progress
To save your progress, press the Up Button to open the\nmenu, then scroll with the ZL or ZR Button until you reach\nthe Save screen.\n\nThere is also an [VAR FF00(0006)]autosave[VAR FF00(0000)] function you can use to have your\nprogress saved automatically.\n\nYou can enable or disable autosave by scrolling to the Help\nscreen in the menu, then selecting Settings.
The Lost & Found
If you black out in the field, you may lose some of your items.\nHowever, players from all over the world can find your lost\nitems and send them to you via the internet. This system is\ncalled the Lost & Found.
If you find a satchel that someone else has lost, be sure to\npick it up. The satchel you retrieved will be returned to its\nowner, and you can receive [VAR FF00(0006)]Merit Points [VAR FF00(0000)]([VAR FF00(0006)]MP[VAR FF00(0000)]) as a reward.
[VAR FF00(0006)]MP [VAR FF00(0000)]can be exchanged for items at the trading post in Jubilife\nVillage. Pick up lost satchels whenever you find them, and you\nmay be able to get your hands on some very special items!
Mystery Gifts
You can receive Pokémon, items, and other special gifts via the\ninternet or by using codes or passwords.\n\nBe sure to keep an eye on the latest Pokémon news for\ninformation about any available Mystery Gifts.

Battling Pokémon Nobles
To claim victory against a noble Pokémon and quell its\nfrenzy, you’ll have to throw balms at it until its frenzy\ngauge reaches zero.
If you manage to create an opening in the noble’s defenses,\nyou’ll be able to send out your Pokémon to battle against it.\nWin the Pokémon battle, and the noble’s guard will stay down\nfor a brief time. During that window, balms will be more\neffective than usual, so throw as many as you can.
Focusing on a Noble
The ZL Button can also be used to focus on a noble Pokémon\nwhile you are facing off against it.\n\nObserve your opponent’s movements carefully to dodge its\nattacks and seize opportunities to throw balms.
The Powerful Attacks of Nobles
When a noble Pokémon starts accumulating energy, that means\nit’s preparing to launch a powerful attack.\n\nHit it with as many balms as you can during this phase in order\nto stop that attack in its tracks.
...
Battling Kleavor
When Kleavor charges at you, dodge to the side using the\nY Button to evade his swinging axes. If you’ve positioned\nyourself well, he may crash into a wall or the tree in the center\nof the arena. This will be your chance to throw one of your\nparty Pokémon’s Poké Balls and initiate a [VAR FF00(0006)]Pokémon battle[VAR FF00(0000)]!
Battling Lilligant
Press the Y Button at the right moment to dodge Lilligant’s\nwave attacks as they ripple out toward you. Remember that\nyou’re [VAR FF00(0006)]invulnerable [VAR FF00(0000)]while dodging, so you can pass through\nthe attacks without taking any damage.
Battling Arcanine
When Arcanine starts building up energy, that means he’s\npreparing to unleash a devastating pillar of flame that’s\nimpossible to evade. Hit him with [VAR FF00(0006)]as many balms as you can[VAR FF00(0000)]\nduring this phase to stop his attack in its tracks.
Battling Electrode
When it looks like Electrode is about to explode, hurry and\nget as far from it as possible! After the explosion, don’t miss\nthe opportunity to send out your Pokémon to face Electrode\nin battle.
Battling Avalugg
While Avalugg’s barrage of attacks is ongoing, concentrate\non dodging and wait for your chance to strike back.\nThe powerful beam that Avalugg launches from his maw can\nbe evaded with the Y Button if you use your brief [VAR FF00(0006)]window of\ninvulnerability[VAR FF00(0000)] to dodge straight through it!

Massive Mass Outbreaks
A massive mass outbreak is a phenomenon in which many mass\noutbreaks occur at once. Mass outbreak locations are marked by\n“?” icons on the map, and you won’t know what Pokémon can be\nfound there until you go see. These rare outbreaks will [VAR FF00(0006)]dissipate\nin time[VAR FF00(0000)], so you’ll need to hurry to investigate them!
Catch or defeat Pokémon at a mass outbreak before it\ndissipates to [VAR FF00(0006)]finish investigating [VAR FF00(0000)]that particular location.\nSometimes, additional Pokémon may appear immediately\nafter you complete your investigation.
Massive Mass Outbreaks and Aguav Berries
While massive mass outbreaks are ongoing, you can give\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Aguav Berries[VAR FF00(0000)] to Mai’s Munchlax to find out what Pokémon\nare appearing at each mass outbreak location.
Pokémon icons with a sparkle mark the locations of special\nmass outbreaks, while those with a Berry indicate mass\noutbreaks where you may be able to receive Aguav Berries.\nBe sure to make the most of these to help out with your\ninvestigations into massive mass outbreaks!

Dummy\c
Moves, items... Use them well, and the world will open up to you!\c
Whoa... You seem so in sync with your Pokémon.\c
You and your Pokémon seem to be completely in step with one another.\c
The orders you give your Pokémon draw out their inner strengths...thanks\nto the trust between you.\c
n/a
What a disgrace...\c
I don’t get it! How’d I lose?!\c
What a blithering mooncalf I am. How could I let myself lose...\c
Bravo! Excellent!\c
n/a
n/a
n/a
It seems my ninja techniques will soon be consigned to history...\c
Any Pokémon that threatens our life here...must be eliminated!\c
Why? Why you?! Why do you have the blessing of Arceus?!\c
n/a
Well now, I didn’t expect that...\c
Your Pokémon [VAR 1101(00FD,0302)]isare simply unstoppable!\c
The way that you battle with your Pokémon... Your skill is peerless!\c
n/a
n/a
Oops! I keep finding myself caught up in observing the way the Pokémon\nuse their moves...\c
Oh boy. Pikachu’s going to be angry with me...again.\c
Oh my! You’re quite adept at instructing your Pokémon in battle.\nMy goodness, that was fun!\c
I’m not fond of this outcome, but at least it’s still better than plowing\nfields for the Galaxy Team!\c
Well, you are rather formidable...\c
[~ 27]
[~ 28]
There’s something so...natural about the sight of you and your Pokémon\nfighting together.\c
The way you battle makes fighting alongside Pokémon look like the most\nnatural thing.\c
I guess doing research tasks and learning is one thing, and using that\nknowledge well is another...\c
I’ve gotta start putting all my Survey Corps learnings to use in battle...\c
n/a
n/a
n/a
n/a
Your skill is as impressive as ever. Exploring ruins should be no problem!\c
n/a
n/a
I was going to flatten you into mochi, but you chewed me up and spat\nme out...\c
I would expect nothing less from a member of the Survey Corps!\nYou understand Pokémon well.\c
Even frightful creatures like Pokémon can become powerful allies...\c
n/a
n/a
n/a
n/a
n/a
n/a
n/a
n/a
A disgraceful outcome...\c
I really don’t get it.\c
Hmph!\c
Even more disgraceful. How...how could I fail again?\c
I’m never gonna get this. Why can’t I win...?\c
Hmph! I let you win.\c
A disgraceful outcome...\c
I really don’t get it.\c
Hmph!\c
Even more disgraceful. How...how could I fail again?\c
I’m never gonna get this. Why can’t I win...?\c
Hmph! I let you win.\c
A disgraceful outcome...\c
I really don’t get it.\c
Hmph!\c
Even more disgraceful. How...how could I fail again?\c
I’m never gonna get this. Why can’t I win...?\c
Hmph! I let you win.\c
A disgraceful outcome...\c
I really don’t get it.\c
Hmph!\c
How...how could I fail again?\c
I’m never gonna get this. Why can’t I win...?\c
Hmph! I let you win.\c
A disgraceful outcome...\c
I really don’t get it.\c
Hmph!\c
I can only blame this on my lack of preparation. I can’t live with this\ndisgraceful defeat otherwise.\c
I don’t get this! I just DON’T! You’re just some nobody—why can’t I\nbeat you?\c
Shameful. Completely shameful for me to lose to someone like you.\c
Bravo! Excellent!\c
I see you’re as impressive as ever...\c
I see you’re as impressive as ever...\nIt can be tough to decide when to use agile style or strong style.\c
I see you’re as impressive as ever...\nAs for me, well... Maybe I need to rethink the moves I use.\c
I should expect nothing less of someone who works for Cyllene, one of\nthe finest to ever wield a sword in all Hoenn...\c
Toughening up your Pokémon is great, but I hope you’ll also teach the\nothers how to love them like you do...\c
A training match to help each other become the best we can be...\nI’ll take that over a messy battle any day.\c
It’s thanks to my Pokémon that I’ve made it as far as I have!\c
I’d have liked to win for the sake of my Pokémon, after all the courage\nand cheer they’ve given me...\c
Much like a ninja’s techniques, the secret to Pokémon moves is\nknowing when to use them.\c
I s’pose when you know the path has no end, you feel the urge to test\nhow far down it you can go.\c
I’m reminded once more just how terrifying Pokémon can be...\nBut that is nothing compared to how dependable they are!\c
You have a strength that I can’t overcome simply by training my Pokémon.\nMost impressive!\c
I know now that Hisui isn’t a land of terrifying Pokémon after all, but\nrather a place where we can live alongside Pokémon as friends.\c
You must become even stronger—and always remember that kindness is\nthe foundation for strength!\c
Hrrrm. Even giving my best, I was unable to defeat you... That leaves me\nwith only one recourse—to make my best even better!\c
You broke through my defenses! I thought I could do better than that,\nseeing as how I’m a guardsman...\c
What incredible strength. I’m proud to call you my protegé!\c
There’s nothing you can’t survey with strength like that!\c

Possesses cheek sacs in which it stores electricity. This clever\nforest-dweller roasts tough berries with an electric shock before\nconsuming them.
It can discharge bursts of electricity exceeding 100,000 volts—\na single strike with that amount of power would incapacitate one\nof the Copperajah of my homeland.

It can be found in quiet mountain areas on a full moon’s night.\nIts dancing and its tiny, faintly glowing wings confer upon it a\nlovely fairylike quality.
Legend says that on clear, quiet nights, it listens for the voices\nof its kin living on the moon. I, too, often think of my homeland,\nso far away.
In its belly burns a fire, which Vulpix spits out in the form of\nfireballs. When young, this Pokémon has but one white tail.\nAs the Pokémon matures, this single tail splits into six.
The coat of gleaming golden fur is quite magnificent.\nThis species is said to store sacred power in its nine long tails\nand to live for a millennium.
[~ 39]
[~ 40]
Makes its home in gloomy caves. Atrophied eyes have left this\nPokémon blind, so it scans its surroundings via sound waves that\nit emits from its mouth as it flies.
It sinks its sharp fangs into other creatures and slurps up their\nblood. A closer look at the fangs reveals that they are hollow\nand akin to straws.
[~ 43]
[~ 44]
[~ 45]
Sometimes seen at the foot of trees in humid forests.\nThe mushrooms on its back—called tochukaso—are not present\non infant specimens and instead emerge as Paras matures.
Mushroom-lacking specimens of this Pokémon lie unmoving in\nthe forest, lending credence to the hypothesis that the large\nmushroom is in control of Parasect’s actions.

Suffers perpetual headaches. If the agony grows too great,\nPsyduck’s latent power erupts, contrary to Psyduck’s intent.\nErgo, I am exploring ways to ease the pain.
Its body is strong, and it has webbing on its hands and feet.\nGolduck can swim easily through rough seas, clawing its way\nthrough the high waves.

Spends 18 hours of the day sleeping. Even while asleep, Abra\ncan control its psychic powers—should danger approach, the\nPokémon will simply teleport away.
There are rumors that a child with mystical powers became\na Kadabra; however, this remains unverified. I suspect that\nthe spoon Kadabra holds enhances its brain waves.
The longer Alakazam lives, the larger and heavier its head\nbecomes. Our tests have shown that the strength of its psychic\npowers correlates positively to the weight of its head.
Though as small as a child, it has strength enough to easily throw\na well-built adult. Striving to become ever stronger, Machop\ntrains by carrying a Graveler on its shoulders.
A sturdy creature boasting a robust physique and boundless\nstamina. Loves training above all else and voluntarily assists with\ntasks such as construction and clearing land.
In close combat, its four arms afford it offensive and defensive\nsupremacy. In but a blink, this valiant Pokémon can overwhelm\nits foes with more than 1,000 blows from its fists.

They fire beams from the glassy, magenta orbs that resemble\neyes atop their heads, and they drift in shallow seas. During low\ntide, they can sometimes be found on beaches, desiccated.
It has 80 tentacles, each with a venomous tip. These tentacles\nare also extendible, lengthening when Tentacruel attempts to\ncatch prey. Use caution.
Makes its home in mountainous regions, using its arms to climb\nalong harsh mountain roads. Can be troublesome—carelessly\nkicking one will cause it to fly into a rage and chase after you.
Dwells in holes dug into sheer walls of stone. It enjoys rolling\ndown slopes as though it were a boulder during a rockfall,\nso keep an eye upward while traversing mountain roads.
The rocklike shell is shed each year. The cast-off shell then\ncrumbles, reverting to a mass of soil, which can be spread across\nfields to promote crop growth.
These Pokémon live in herds out in the grassland. Newborn\nfoals lack their fiery manes, which will develop about an hour\nafter birth.
Fiery mane aglow, Rapidash darts like an arrow across the land.\nThis prodigiously swift creature can traverse the vast region of\nHisui in a day and a half.
[~ 79]
[~ 80]
A bizarre Pokémon with but a single eye embedded in an iron\nsphere. I suspect this creature levitates due to the magnetism it\nemits from its arms, which resemble horseshoe-shaped magnets.
Three Magnemite gathered to evolve into this Pokémon.\nThe source of much vexation on my part, as its powerful\nmagnetism destroys my research equipment.

Gaseous and completely impalpable. Also highly dangerous—\ninhaling part of its poisonous body will cause one to\nfaint instantly.
This frightful, malevolent spirit can glide through walls,\nappearing wherever it likes. According to rumor, victims of\na Haunter’s lick will wither to death day by day.
Possesses potential victims’ shadows in an effort to steal away\nthe victims’ lives. If your shadow begins to laugh, you must take\nhold of a protective charm posthaste!
This chain of immense stones resembles a giant serpent. Tremors\nshake the earth above as it burrows deep beneath the ground,\nfeeding on boulders as it goes.

Wields its long tongue deftly, as though it were an arm.\nThe Pokémon’s viscous saliva, once it has been collected and\nboiled down, yields a strong and highly useful adhesive.
[~ 109]
[~ 110]
Ludicrously strong—when it butts heads with a mountain, it is\nthe mountain that shatters. But its short legs struggle with turns,\nand it is incapable of stopping unless it collides with something.
Rapidly rotates its horn to bore through bedrock. It swaggers\naround volcanic regions, protected from the lava’s heat by its\ntough, armorlike hide.
This purehearted Pokémon shares its eggs with the injured.\nThese eggs are so nutritious that they’ve been nicknamed\n“doctors’ doubles.”
It is cloaked entirely in blue vines, preventing any glimpse of\nits true identity. The vines impart a refreshing sensation when\nchewed—they’re useful as a spice.

The behavior of this clown-like Pokémon reminds one of\npantomime. It creates invisible walls using a force emitted\nfrom its fingertips.
The large, wickedly sharp scythes on its forearms are truly\nfearsome weapons. Prey’s attempts to flee are unfailingly\nthwarted by this Pokémon’s nimble motions.
[~ 124]
Feeds on electrical energy. During sudden showers beneath\nlooming thunderclouds, one can observe Electabuzz scaling tall\ntrees, where the Pokémon will then wait for lightning to strike.
Legend has it that this Pokémon was born from the crater of a\nvolcano. When wounded, it bathes in lava to heal its body, much\nas one would soak in a hot spring.
[~ 127]
[~ 128]
A feeble, pitiful imbecile of a Pokémon that is nonetheless very\nhardy. Unperturbed by turbid water, it can be found living in all\nsorts of places.
I suspect this Pokémon to be the true identity of a dragon\nwritten of in ancient texts, which claimed that it razed an entire\nvillage with white-hot beams from its maw.
[~ 131]
[~ 132]
Harbors the potential to evolve into manifold forms.\nWithin Eevee lies the key to the mysteries of Pokémon\nevolution—I’m certain of it.
Tests show that its cells closely resemble water molecules, which\nperhaps explains its ability to conceal its form while submerged.\nI believe the origins of mermaid folklore lie with this Pokémon.
Bristles its fur into sharp, needlelike points when enraged.\nOne can hear electricity crackle in its breath when it exhales.
Flames burn within a saclike organ inside this Pokémon.\nWhen Flareon inhales, these flames grow in intensity, reaching\na mighty 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit.
It has no discernible heartbeat and does not seem to draw\nbreath, and yet it appears to function without issue. I cannot\neven begin to explain this utterly bizarre anomaly.

Hails from the Johto region. Though usually curled into a ball\ndue to its timid disposition, it harbors tremendous firepower.

[~ 170]
[~ 171]
Pichu stores electricity in the sacs on its cheeks but discharges it\ninadvertently when agitated or excited. Being yet immature,\nthe Pokémon’s handling of electricity is rather inept.
In silhouette, they resemble twinkling starlight. When shooting\nstars rain from the night sky, Cleffa gather in numbers and dance\nas though they are indeed incarnations of the stars.
[~ 174]
This ovate creature is frequently mistaken for a moving egg\nwhen encountered out in the fields or in the mountains.\nIts guileless smile soothes the soul.
No records exist of Togetic being seen in the wilds. Rumors\nabound that it evolves under the loving care of a trusted human\ncompanion, upon whom the Pokémon then bestows great joy.

[~ 186]

This treetop dweller possesses a tail as dexterous as a hand.\nAncient writings describe this Pokémon as a one-armed oddity.
[~ 191]
[~ 192]
Its frail wings are so thin that one can see clear through them.\nHowever, during flight these wings exhibit the power to churn\nair with force enough to launch a house skyward.
[~ 194]
[~ 195]
Wields an arcane power with which it can predict the weather\nand even people’s thoughts. When bathed in sunshine, the\nscarlet orb on its brow glows and builds energy.
It is most active in the wee hours of the night, when moonlight\nbathes the land. Its large eyes can pierce the darkness and\nperceive prey with absolute clarity.
Widely shunned as a bearer of ill fortune. Upon crossing paths\nwith this creature, I’ve been told one must chant “Workrum,\nWorkrum—bad luck, don’t come” as a protective incantation.
[~ 199]
It conceals itself in darkness, sending chills up travelers’ spines\nwith its childlike weeping. As it observes the frightened travelers\nwith glee, the red orbs upon its chest let off an eerie light.
It is hard to believe these strangely shaped Pokémon are truly\nliving creatures. I’ve pointed out that the species’ many forms\nresemble writing from other lands; no one will take me seriously.
[~ 202]
[~ 203]
[~ 204]

Its tail is tipped by a thick, horrible stinger. To bring down prey,\nit will first obscure their vision by covering their faces with its\nbody, and then it will use the stinger to inject them with venom.
This Pokémon evolved through use of a strange item. Its body is\ncoated with steel powder and notably hard—not even diamond\ncan leave so much as a scratch.
[~ 209]
[~ 210]
[~ 211]
Evolved by way of a curious item. The shell covering its body\nhas been shown to be stronger than forged steel.
[~ 213]
This Pokémon has an unparalleled horn. Heracross itself\ndemonstrates tremendous power—it’s capable of throwing\nseveral people trained in the traditional arts of war at once.
This Pokémon shares roots with the Sneasel of Hisui, but unlike\nthat species, this one is spiteful in personality. I hypothesize\nthat water and earth can affect Sneasel’s mind and body.
It licks its paws because of the sweet honey that has soaked into\nthem. It is cunning, stealing into the nests of Combee and taking\nfor itself the honey that the Combee have amassed.
When the cold season arrives in Hisui, this Pokémon will wander\nfields and mountains alike in search of its favorite berries.\nUrsaring’s hunger during this time makes it a ferocious danger.
[~ 218]
[~ 219]
Swinub excels at sniffing out mushrooms buried beneath grass or\nsnow. Since ancient times, the people of Hisui have often relied\nupon this skill.
The long fur of this Pokémon covers its eyes, ears, and even\nlimbs, allowing Piloswine to resist harshly frigid conditions.\nThe Pokémon’s white tusks can be used to defeat its enemies.
[~ 222]
Spits water from its mouth with incredible accuracy. It captures\nBurmy by shooting them down off the branches from which\nthey dangle.
While Octillery still shoots water from its mouth, the drastic\nanatomical difference between it and Remoraid meant that for\na long time, no one believed the former evolved from the latter.
[~ 225]
This calm and gentle Pokémon swims gracefully through the sea.\nAfter building speed, it can leap out of the water. It is often\nmisidentified as a bird Pokémon due to this behavior.
[~ 227]

A bizarre item caused this Pokémon to evolve. While it now\nexhibits many new gestures and expressions, its biology\nremains inscrutable.
Its strangely shaped antlers have the power to bewitch those\nwho see them. Medicine made by grinding up the black orbs\nfrom fallen antlers is an effective treatment for insomnia.
[~ 235]
[~ 236]
[~ 237]

They generate electricity by spinning their arms. During a\nthunderstorm, if one hears the lively voices of children out in the\nwilderness, what one is actually hearing are the voices of Elekid.
This Pokémon lives in volcanic areas. With each breath, sparks\nspurt from its mouth and nose. When Magby is in good health,\nits flames gain a yellow tint.
[~ 241]
A kindhearted Pokémon that will care for any sick person or\nPokémon until their health improves. The eggs it lays are\ndelicious and bring good fortune to those who eat them.

Likes sap and is abundant in the wild. Why it evolves into\nvarious different forms is unknown. One cannot tell from a\nWurmple’s appearance which form it will take when it evolves.
Wraps itself in thin strings of silk while it stores energy for\nevolution. It can’t extend its limbs and its movement is slow,\nbut its eyes keep a sharp lookout—Silcoon is always on guard.
A colorful and incredibly beautiful but also greedy Pokémon.\nIn an effort to keep its favorite food all to itself, it will chase\naway Combee as they try to gather nectar.
The silk coating its body is thin but sufficiently strong. Cascoon’s\nsilk has a luster and texture superior to that of Silcoon’s, and\nclothes made using Cascoon silk are regarded as top-notch.
Tends to be drawn to bonfires on dark nights. Difficult to chase\naway from settlements because of the way it scatters highly\ntoxic scales.

Tends to prefer people with a chipper disposition to those who\nare gloomy, but it has shown no discrimination with regard to\nage or gender. Needs more research.
It resembles a maiden in appearance, but it wields strange\npowers to project visions of paradise. I suspect the crimson\nornaments on its head are the key to its abilities.
It will dedicate itself to defending a master it has come to\nadore. Its pure white dress, reminiscent of those worn by ladies\nof nobility, is the dress of one who is willing to risk their life.

Makes its home in swamps with murky water. The poor visibility\nhides this Pokémon from predators, and the slime on its body\nmakes grasping it difficult.
Strikes its caudal fin against the swamp bed to shake the ground\nand startle its prey. It will then swallow the fleeing prey whole.\nPeople mistook this behavior as the cause of earthquakes.

I’ve heard that the children of Hisui all begin to behave once\nthey’ve been told the story of how this Pokémon roams about\nbefore the witching hour to spirit away misbehaving children.
There are rumors that peeking inside its bandage-wrapped body\nwill cause one to get pulled in through the gaps between the\nbandages, never to return. I’ve been too scared to verify.
[~ 357]
Can emit waves of air powerful enough to knock out prey taller\nthan itself. I hypothesize that it amplifies the faint sound of wind\nwithin its body.
[~ 359]
[~ 360]
Arrives alongside the first snow. It’s thought that homes Snorunt\nvisit will prosper for many generations. By tradition, one might\noffer a lump of ice made from pure water at one’s front door.
It covers its body with an armor of ice harder than steel. Uses its\nbreath to freeze prey, which it then devours as if they were\nfrozen desserts.
During the season when drift ice approaches the shore, Spheal\nprefers living on the ice—where fewer predators lurk—rather\nthan the land. Its fur retains heat superbly and resists harsh cold.
Its white whiskers are very sensitive. Sealeo will balance Spheal\non the tip of its nose, checking its scent and its feel to be sure\nthe Spheal is healthy.
Its thick tusks are strong enough to shatter drift ice. They have\nbeen known to break, but they will grow back by the next year.\nThe Hisui region is well known for these broken tusks.

This Pokémon becomes more energetic the more sunlight there\nis. The part resembling a shell is similar to silt and is slightly\ndamp and warm to the touch.
Appears where there is clean spring water. The fruit that grows\non the shrubs on its shell is sweet, nutritious, and truly delicious.
This remarkable, large-bodied Pokémon would serve beautifully\nas borrowed scenery for a garden, and its strength is peerless.\nTorterra roams the wilderness in search of clean water.
Full of vigor and always in high spirits. It was once known by the\nname “Lantern-Tail” and feared as some kind of apparition.
The deeper the blue on its face, the more powerful it will grow\nto become. It leaps about every which way and lands powerful\nblows against its opponents with the flame on its tail.
A tall, hardy Pokémon with a dazzling appearance. It shrouds\nitself in flame and battles as if engaged in dance—truly a sight\nto behold.
Prefers cold climes and appears along coasts. It’s an adorable\nlittle thing—as cute as any child—but it’s also prideful, unwilling\nto accept handouts from people.
It swims gracefully through the frigid sea and sings with a voice\nlike the roaring tide. It has powerful, sturdy wings and dignity\nto match.
Since ancient times, it has been revered by the people of Hisui,\nwho call it the Master of the Waves. Its wings are a match for\neven master-crafted blades.
They live in the fields and mountains, gathering in large flocks.\nTheir cries are quite obnoxious. Though small, their wings are\nstrong—a strike from them leaves pain that persists for a week.
They form remarkably large flocks and are constantly fighting\namongst themselves. I suspect that those with magnificent\nplumes on their heads are the strong ones.
It has left the flock, having gained strength enough to survive on\nits own. The astounding force with which Staraptor flies through\nthe air allows it to carry away large, burly targets.
Bidoof has an unsophisticated face and is rarely flustered by\nanything. There have been incidents involving Bidoof sauntering\ninto villages and gnawing on the houses without a single care.
Bibarel fur repels water and is also a fantastic material for heat\nretention. These Pokémon create dams on rivers to live in.
When the trees take on new hues, more of these Pokémon\nappear. The tone they create by striking their antennae together\nresembles that of the marimba, an instrument of foreign lands.
It uses its cutlass-like arms to produce sound, the melody of\nwhich varies from individual to individual. It is a worthwhile\nendeavor to seek out one’s favorite tunes.
Shakes its body to generate electricity. Its stature belies its\naggression—one must be patient to tame this Pokémon.
Proudly uses its electrified claws as weapons. It seems to be a\ngracious Pokémon, evenly sharing the spoils of the hunt with\nothers of its kind.
They form packs, each having one male as leader. Legends say\nthat when Luxray’s two eyes shimmer with gold, the Pokémon\ncan see through anything.
When the sun’s light strengthens, the bud atop this Pokémon’s\nhead opens. This is a sign to the people that the harsh winter is\nover, and the season of budding has begun.
Hidden within the bouquet on each hand are thorned whips\nloaded with virulent poison. Roserade moves gracefully as it\ncorners its prey and mercilessly lashes them with its whips.
An incredibly rare sight. They duel each other by ramming their\nheads together, and the resulting sound echoes throughout the\narea like the pealing of a bell.
Very little is known about its biology. Can knock down massive\ntrees by smashing its beautiful, pearl-like crown against them.
Much remains unknown about this Pokémon, as few have ever\nseen it. However, we know that it is calm and dislikes conflict,\nand it enjoys polishing its face against trees and rocks.
Its face is sturdy—as strong as diamond—and this hardness\noffers a very stable defense. Much about this species is still\nunknown, such as its natural habitat.
If its cloak is even slightly damaged, Burmy will immediately\nrepair it with whatever is close at hand. The Pokémon within the\ncloak is scrawny and vulnerable to the cold.
The cloak—fashioned from plant matter—has merged with the\nPokémon and is now part of the body, like fur or skin. I suspect\nthis fusion is an effect of the energy involved in evolution.
Scatters steel-colored scales as it flaps its wings. Despite\nbeing observed feeding primarily on the nectar of flowers,\nMothim is not often seen around flower gardens.
They swear fealty to a queen Pokémon and work diligently to\ngather nectar. Each swarm produces a different flavor of honey.
Commands its subjects to build its hive. It will dispatch any\ninterlopers who dare sneak into its nest and use them as\nnourishment for itself.
A species related to the Pikachu line. Though Pachirisu is a calm\nPokémon, it still presents a danger should one touch its\nelectrified tail or cheeks.
It moves freely in the water by spinning its forked tail for\npropulsion. The resemblance to the screw of a steamboat\nis coincidental.
Has a long, rather splendid flotation sac, which prevents\nFloatzel from drowning even in stormy seas. One might glimpse\nthis species around fishing hamlets from time to time.
Once the fruit growing alongside the main body is large and\nplump, Cherubi will use the nutrients within to evolve. The fruit\nthen detaches, becoming nourishment for other creatures.
Motionless, save for the occasional quiver. A rich array of\nPokémon can be found gathered around it, drawn by the\nscent exuded from Cherrim’s folded petals.
Found in abundance on seashores bordering warm waters.\nShellos are unexpectedly friendly and will crawl toward any\nperson they see. Take care not to get coated in mucus!
Eats beach sand for nourishment. Should one Gastrodon\nencounter another of a different color, a fierce battle will\ninevitably ensue.
To affirm their kinship, members of this species will form a ring\nby linking their newly doubled tails together. On rare occasions,\nhumans have been accepted into such rings.
Said to lure away young children and carry them off to the\nafterlife. Some whisper that Drifloon are formed of reincarnated\nhuman souls, but these rumors are as yet unconfirmed.
It drifts along at dusk, perfectly silent. Its transient, melancholy\naspect touches some people deeply—every so often, one will\ncome upon a song or poem devoted to Drifblim.
My hypothesis as to why Buneary rolls up its ears is that its\nhearing is far too keen. I surmise that the Pokémon protects its\nhearing by limiting the sound that may enter its ears.
Its fur is warm and yet remarkably light. This Pokémon kicks as\nthough it were a master of karate, driving back its opponents\nwith ease.
The incantations Mismagius chants can ward against misfortune,\nso a custom exists of inviting it into one’s home. Incur the\nPokémon’s displeasure, however, and disaster will surely ensue.
One cry from this Pokémon, and a murder of Murkrow come\nflying. At such times, one would think the curtain of night had\nfallen, plunging the world into jet-black darkness.
Bewitches humans with its helical tail and piercing gaze.\nIts hidden claws are quite sharp as well, making this Pokémon\nan exceedingly tricky opponent if antagonized.
Though impudent and difficult to tame, Purugly enjoys great\npopularity due to its fur, the beauty of which surpasses\neven velveteen.
This Pokémon gave me an excruciating headache when it\nseemingly cried out without making a sound. Perhaps there are\nsome sounds that the human ear is simply incapable of hearing.
The poison that gushes from its aft end is accompanied by an\nutterly evil-smelling odor with such potency that one whiff can\ninduce memory loss.
Sprays a poisonous fluid to take down prey. Sometimes, unable\nto stomach the stench of its own fluid, it leaves the bested\nprey uneaten.
Floats using a mysterious energy. The pattern engraved upon its\nback is held as sacred and can sometimes be found in imagery\nfrom ancient cemeteries and other such timeworn places.
Some believe that its bell-like cry opens holes to another world.\nIt has been revered as a deity since ancient times.
Its tears elicit sympathy from those who see them, but do\nnot be deceived! This expulsion of body water is merely a\nphysiological mechanism for keeping itself in good health.
Known to turn up in bustling marketplaces now and again.\nIt mimics people much as a child would, then watches how they\nreact, eyes sparkling.
In imitation of Chansey, it keeps a round stone tucked into its\nbelly pouch and cherishes it dearly. It gets along well with\nchildren and will sometimes play house with them for fun.
A versatile performer skilled in the imitation of human speech.\nIt is said that older, more experienced Chatot can even\nunderstand the meaning of the words they mimic.
It lays curses by thinking wicked thoughts. Writings tell that this\nPokémon was born out of the assembly of five score and eight\nmalevolent spirits.
It nests in caves untouched by sunlight. Its sharp teeth may fall\nout when worn away or after an impact, but they regrow within\na few days.
Though Gabite are usually of a violent disposition, when I gave\none a glass bead it had been eyeing covetously, it suddenly\nbecame quite docile.
Soars across the heavens at blinding speed—a magnificent sight!\nIt has a feral disposition. Utmost caution is required if one\nmeets a Garchomp out in the wilds.
Its robust stomach allows it to nonchalantly devour even rotted\nmatter. It pays frequent visits to villages, seeking out food\nscraps intended for compost.
Though infantile in appearance, it has the mysterious ability to\nread the minds of humans. The pure of heart are met with\nRiolu’s approval, while those of ill nature earn only its loathing.
A most gallant-looking creature. It emits energy waves and\ncontrols them with precision, using them to sense even faraway\nbeings. I have given the name “aura” to this power.
Though large and languid, Hippopotas is difficult to detect\ndue to its tendency to burrow into and lurk beneath the soil.\nWhen agitated or excited, it expels sand from its nostrils.
Short-tempered and easily moved to violence. It whips up\nwhirlwinds of sand to crush its foes’ spirits, then goes in for\nthe attack.
Its claws are not only razor-sharp but poisonous, making Skorupi\na highly dangerous Pokémon. It seems to be weakened by cold\ntemperatures, however.
Has a brutish, ferocious temperament. With immense strength\nand a sturdy shell off which swords will bounce, it rampages\nabout and wreaks havoc.
A poison wielder with a dastardly personality. Despite such\nqualities, this species is afforded a measure of popularity due\nto its peculiar cry and comical features.
Its crimson claws contain a virulent toxin. This toxin can be made\ninto a tonic by diluting it, mixing it with several types of wild\ngrass, and boiling it down over two days.
Though this is a plant Pokémon, it has a gluttonous and unruly\ntemperament. Carnivine attacks its prey with its cavernous maw\nwide open.
What a gorgeous sight this Pokémon is as it swims with its long,\npink-painted caudal fins fluttering behind it. Finneon’s beautiful\nappearance has led to its nickname: “finery fish.”
Uses its gleaming fins to hunt its prey. The view of Lumineon\nschooling near the surface of the sea at night is breathtaking—\nit’s as though there were shining stars right there.
Though ball-like in shape, this Pokémon is a proficient swimmer.\nI have discovered that if a Mantyke spends much time with\nschools of Remoraid, it will eventually achieve evolution.
One is likely to encounter this Pokémon while out in the snow.\nThere are stories of Snover appearing in human settlements but\ndoing no harm—rather, they bond with the children.
A powerful Pokémon that can split huge boulders with ease.\nDislikes associating with others and chooses to live quietly deep\nwithin the mountains, playing with the snow.
This species corners prey as a pack, under the guidance of\na leader. Weavile displays increased cunning, leading me to\nspeculate that its evolution caused further brain development.
I theorize that a special magnetic field influenced this Pokémon,\nchanging its molecular structure and causing it to evolve. It emits\nstrange radio waves toward space from its antenna.
Its tongue can extend and contract freely, and it is capable of\nreaching lengths over 10 times Lickilicky’s height. Beware of the\nsaliva, as it contains corrosive elements.
This Pokémon evolved through use of a curious item. Its rocklike\nhide is composed of a mysterious substance and can withstand a\nblow from a masterwork sword with nary a scratch.
Draped with long vines, it resembles a shrub in appearance.\nIt swings bundles of vines as though they were arms, wrapping\nthem around prey to ensnare them.
Its evolution was induced by an unusual item, and its electrical\noutput rises along with its heart rate. From its tails, it can\nunleash an electric current measuring 20,000 volts.
Use of a strange item caused this Pokémon to evolve. Fireballs\nlaunched from the ends of its tubelike arms are hot enough to\nmelt an iron pot in an instant.
Scant few have ever sighted this Pokémon. After studying what\nliterature remains, I am certain Togekiss will reveal itself when\npeace reigns in the land.
Extremely violent. When hunting, it wastes none of its energy,\naiming only for prey’s most vulnerable spots. Any who manage\nto tame this Pokémon must be of incredible bravery.
Cells similar to those of plants have been found in its fur.\nIts hard tail can fell a large tree with one stroke, and the tail’s\nsharpness exceeds even that of a sword crafted by a master.
Glaceon is able to lower its body temperature very quickly.\nIt freezes the atmosphere, creating diamond dust that glitters\nlike gems while it flutters and dances around.
It glides soundlessly on pitch-black wings and sinks sharp fangs\ninto the throat of its prey. It takes on a look of satisfaction once\nit has entirely drained its prey of blood.
This species reached its zenith during the period known as the\nice age. I suspect that Hisui’s frigid climate is in harmony with\nMamoswine’s constitution, thus awakening hidden potential.
A curious item induced this evolution. The Pokémon’s offensive\ncapabilities have greatly increased, but the strangeness of its\nbehavior has magnified in equal measure. This worries me.
The blades extending from its elbows are sharper than the\nfinest swords. Its swordsmanship, albeit self-taught, is\nastonishingly impressive.
It is able to emit powerful magnetism, allowing it control over\nthe iron sand that forms its luscious mustache. Using this iron\nsand, Probopass forms hard stones with which it smites its prey.
Comes to those whose lives have come to an end and escorts\ntheir souls to the afterlife. Known to mistakenly take the souls of\nthose who yet have life left in them, albeit rarely.
A Pokémon inhabited by the soul of a woman who died bearing\na grudge in the snowy mountains. Legends of Froslass placing\ndeathly curses on misbehaving men send shivers down my spine.
This bizarre Pokémon appears to be a will-o’-the-wisp powered\nby electricity. Be wary, as Rotom is both smart and mischievous.
A Pokémon feared but also respected for stealing away the\nmemories of evildoers. I have found records that suggest Uxie\nholds dominion over knowledge.
Known as the Being of Emotion. In legend, this Pokémon was\nfeared, as any who showed disrespect would have their\nemotions thrown into disarray.
The dreaded Being of Willpower. Legends tell of this Pokémon\nmanipulating the will of its adversaries and turning them into\npuppets of its own.
This Pokémon is revered as a deity in Hisuian legend. The birth\nof Dialga was what caused the vast river of time to begin\nflowing in our world.
This Pokémon is feared as a deity in Hisuian legend. The birth\nof Palkia was what caused the walls of our world to disappear,\ncreating a sky that spans for infinity.
Stories tell of this Pokémon being birthed from the boiling\nmagma within Mount Coronet. Its molten-steel body holds\nmany mysteries.
According to legend, Regigigas pulled landmasses together and\nbound them with rope to create the continent of Hisui. Though I\nhave my doubts, the story could well contain a shred of truth.
There is one Hisuian verse that tells of a powerful light creating\na deep shadow. I imagine that this deep shadow is Giratina.
Cresselia is reminiscent of the crescent moon. It leaves a brilliant\nline of light in its wake as it flies across the night sky. I daresay\nit resembles the heavenly maiden who created the Milky Way.
Can be seen floating offshore during seasons when the seas are\nwarm. Its azure body blends in with the ocean waters—logic\nsuggests this is a defense mechanism against natural predators.
Rumored to migrate across the oceans and visit Hisui’s coastal\nwaters only rarely. Although Manaphy resembles Phione, it is\nalso quite different. The relation between the two is unclear.
On a moonless night, a strange incident occurred in which every\none of a village’s inhabitants suffered nightmares. The villagers\nattested that Darkrai appeared before them in these nightmares.
When the turning of seasons brings the cruel winter to its end\nand the joyous people give thanks to the heavens, Shaymin\nappears and covers the withered land with flowers.
It is the heavenly fount from which pours the light that shines\nacross Hisui. Its luminance guides and protects all Pokémon.\nHisuian mythology states that Arceus is the creator of all things.

This Pokémon from the Unova region uses the shell on its belly\nas a weapon to cut down its foes. Thus, I’ve conferred upon this\nshell the name “scalchop.”
Its exquisite double-scalchop technique is likely the result of\ndaily training, and it can send even masters of the blade fleeing\nin defeat.

This storm-stirring Pokémon is said to cause the seasons to\nturn by whipping up the air. I suspect its humanlike form to be\na false one.
They say this wielder of electricity has waged war with its\nnemesis, Tornadus, since time immemorial. The lightning bolts\nit hurls pierce the very earth and enrich the soil.

When the incarnations of wind and of lightning clash, Landorus\narrives to quell the conflict. After the tempests and thunderbolts\nabate, the land is sure to be blessed with bountiful harvests.

Flies noiselessly on delicate wings. It has mastered the art of\ndeftly launching dagger-sharp feathers from those same wings.
Regularly basks in sunlight to gather power—presumably due to\nthe frigid climate. Nonetheless, the edges of the blade quills set\ninto its wings are keen as ever.

The black orbs shine with an uncanny light when the Pokémon is\nerecting invisible barriers. The fur shed from its beard retains\nheat well and is a highly useful material for winter clothing.
A violent creature that fells towering trees with its crude axes\nand shields itself with hard stone. If one should chance upon\nthis Pokémon in the wilds, one’s only recourse is to flee.
I believe it was Hisui’s swampy terrain that gave Ursaluna its\nburly physique and newfound capacity to manipulate peat\nat will.
Clads itself in the souls of comrades that perished before\nfulfilling their goals of journeying upstream. No other species\nthroughout all Hisui’s rivers is Basculegion’s equal.
Because of Sneasler’s virulent poison and daunting physical\nprowess, no other species could hope to best it on the frozen\nhighlands. Preferring solitude, this species does not form packs.
Its lancelike spikes and savage temperament have earned it the\nnickname “sea fiend.” It slurps up poison to nourish itself.
When it flies to this land from across the sea, the bitter winter\ncomes to an end. According to legend, this Pokémon’s love\ngives rise to the budding of fresh life across Hisui.

These Pokémon live in packs in the snowy mountains and defend\nthemselves with icy breath. I suspect this species changed its\nform to adapt to the frigid climate.
Dwells on sacred peaks perpetually covered in snow. Said to\nappear to virtuous people who have lost their way on mountain\npaths—it then guides them back down to the mountain’s base.

They patrol their territory in pairs. I believe the igneous\nrock components in the fur of this species are the result of\nvolcanic activity in its habitat.
Snaps at its foes with fangs cloaked in blazing flame. Despite its\nbulk, it deftly feints every which way, leading opponents on a\ndeceptively merry chase as it all but dances around them.

An enigmatic Pokémon that happens to bear a resemblance to a\nPoké Ball. When excited, it discharges the electric current it has\nstored in its belly, then lets out a great, uproarious laugh.

It creates a cloak by weaving together sand, mud, and silk it\nhas spat out. This earthen cloak is ruined by wind and rain,\nso the Pokémon hides away in caves and other such places.
When confronted by a lack of other materials, Burmy will create\nits cloak using dust and refuse. The cloak seems to be more\ncomfortable than one would think.
Its earthen skin is reasonably hard—it has no problem repelling\na Starly’s pecking, at least.
Its body, composed of refuse, blends in to the scenery so much\nas to be inconspicuous. This seems to be the perfect way for the\nPokémon to evade the detection of predators.
[~ 1034]
[~ 1035]
Cheerfully active on sunny days. Immediately closes its petals\nand becomes immobile once the sun becomes hidden, however.
Found in abundance on seashores bordering cold waters.\nWhen pressed upon, the Pokémon will secrete from its body’s\nsurface a purple fluid that will stain one’s clothes.
Found more often on the land than in the sea. More active\nwhen it’s cloudy or rainy out than when the weather is fair.

A form in which Rotom lurks within a strange cauldron.\nThe cauldron’s origin is unknown. A bothersome Pokémon,\ncausing trouble with the flames it spits.
A form in which Rotom lurks within an odd bureau. The bureau’s\npurpose is unknown. A bothersome Pokémon, causing trouble\nby splashing cold water everywhere.
A form in which Rotom lurks within a bizarre cupboard.\nThe cupboard’s composition is unknown. A bothersome\nPokémon, causing trouble by frosting everything over.
A form in which Rotom lurks within a mysterious contraption.\nThe contraption’s purpose is unknown. A bothersome Pokémon,\ncausing trouble by stirring up powerful winds.
A form in which Rotom lurks within a misshapen wheelbarrow.\nThe wheelbarrow’s mechanisms are bizarre. It’s a bothersome\nPokémon, causing trouble by mowing down grass and trees.
Radiant light caused Dialga to take on a form bearing a striking\nresemblance to the creator Pokémon. Dialga now wields such\ncolossal strength that one must conclude this is its true form.
It soars across the sky in a form that greatly resembles the\ncreator of all things. Perhaps this imitation of appearance is\nPalkia’s strategy for gaining Arceus’s powers.
Giratina loses its legs upon changing into this form. I believe this\nPokémon must hail from a world where the heavens and the\nearth are as one, though I have no way of proving it.
Upon taking in the scent of a particular rare flower, Shaymin is\nenveloped in light, and its tiny body transforms. I took a whiff\nof the flower myself, but alas, my body remained unchanged.
It is the heavenly fount from which pours the light that shines\nacross Hisui. Its luminance guides and protects all Pokémon.\nHisuian mythology states that Arceus is the creator of all things.

Hard of heart and deft of blade, this rare form of Samurott is\na product of the Pokémon’s evolution in the region of Hisui. Its\nturbulent blows crash into foes like ceaseless pounding waves.

I suspect that its well-developed legs are the result of a life\nspent on mountains covered in deep snow. The scent it exudes\nfrom its flower crown heartens those in proximity.

Though it differs from other Basculin in several respects,\nincluding demeanor—this one is gentle—I have categorized\nit as a regional form given the vast array of shared qualities.

A once-departed soul, returned to life in Hisui. Derives power\nfrom resentment, which rises as energy atop its head and takes\non the forms of foes. In this way, Zorua vents lingering malice.
With its disheveled white fur, it looks like an embodiment of\ndeath. Heedless of its own safety, Zoroark attacks its nemeses\nwith a bitter energy so intense, it lacerates Zoroark’s own body.

Screaming a bloodcurdling battle cry, this huge and ferocious\nbird Pokémon goes out on the hunt. It blasts lakes with shock\nwaves, then scoops up any prey that float to the water’s surface.
An example of what is known as a “form change,” though I\nsuspect this strange avian guise to be Tornadus’s true form.\nTornadus has been sighted crossing the ocean while in this form.
Quick as a flash, it materializes out of nowhere. It pulverizes\nfoes into nothingness with showers of devastatingly powerful\nlightning bolts launched from the string of orbs on its tail.
Landorus soars through the sky in this form, bestowing plentiful\nharvests upon the land and earning the people’s reverence.\nIt can traverse the whole of Hisui in a mere couple of hours.

A creature given to melancholy. I suspect its metallic shell\ndeveloped as a result of the mucus on its skin reacting with\nthe iron in Hisui’s water.
Able to freely control the hardness of its metallic shell.\nIt loathes solitude and is extremely clingy—it will fume and\nrun riot if those dearest to it ever leave its side.

Clads itself in the souls of comrades that perished before\nfulfilling their goals of journeying upstream. No other species\nthroughout all Hisui’s rivers is Basculegion’s equal.
A different guise from its feminine humanoid form. From the\nclouds, it descends upon those who treat any form of life with\ndisrespect and metes out wrathful, ruthless punishment.

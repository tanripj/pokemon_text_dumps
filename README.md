# Pokémon main series game text files
All the gametext and storytext files for the gen 6 through 9 Pokémon games
(currently X/Y through Scarlet/Violet v1.3.2), in all the languages each game
supports.

I needed a complete set of official translations, and I couldn't find one
anywhere online. So, I made one myself. I'm sharing it in case anyone else ever
needs it too.

Some of them were dumped myself, and some are from abcboy on Bulbapedia:

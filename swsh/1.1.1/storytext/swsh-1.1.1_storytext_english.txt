Splendid! That’s the first Rotom Rally you’ve\nsuccessfully completed!\r\nHere’s a little souvenir for the occasion!
Amazing! You’ve earned over [VAR 0204(0001,002C)] points!\nHere’s a little souvenir for the occasion!
Thank you so much for participating in the\nRotom Rally! Here’s a little souvenir for\r\nyou, as a sign of my gratitude!
If you let me give your bike some extra power,\nI can make it charge up the turbo boost faster!\r\nIt’ll cost you [VAR 0205(0000,002C)] W, though. Is that OK?
If you let me give your bike more power,\nI can help the turbo boost charge up even faster!\r\nIt’ll cost you [VAR 0205(0000,002C)] W, though. Is that OK?
If you let me give your bike even more power,\nI can increase its turbo-boost charge speed to\r\nthe maximum! It’ll cost you [VAR 0205(0000,002C)] W,\r\nthough. Is that OK?
All right, your bike has extra power!\nSince your turbo boost charges faster now, why\r\nnot have another go at the Rotom Rally?
All right, your bike has extra power!\nSince your turbo boost charges faster now, why\r\nnot have another go at the Rotom Rally?

Stopper message (TBD)
At last, the Gym Challenge’s opening ceremony!\nMy heart is pounding with all the excitement!
Corrr!
Motostoke is something else!\c\nWhat other city has a lift to take you between\nthe upper and the lower districts?
The eight Gym Leaders that challengers have\nto face...\c\nThey’re all frightfully strong. I wonder if any of\nthe Gym Challengers stand a chance.
[~ 5]
No wandering into that tall grass for you if\nyou’ve got no Pokémon of your own, mate![VAR 0114(0005)]
You can’t go any farther in with that Wooloo\nstanding in the way!
And where do you think you’re off to, then?\nWe’re having a battle—you and me![VAR 0114(0005)]
Be serious, would you?\nWe’ve got to go look for that Pokémon![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 10]
[~ 11]
Sorry, but Team Yell caused quite the kerfuffle,\nand now the bridge is in a bit of a state...\c\nWe’ll have things cleaned quick as can be done,\nbut could you give us some time?
If you’re looking for your Bag, [VAR 0100(0000)],\ndidn’t you leave it in your room?\r\nAnd grab yourself a hat for the weather, as well![VAR 0114(0008)]
Heya, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nHop was looking for you, you know.\c\nBut no need to go to the next town to find him\nwhen he lives right next door, right?
[~ 15]
You did tell your mum that we’re heading to\nWedgehurst, right?\r\nShe’ll go spare if you disappear without a word.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Mzzz... Mzzz...
You wouldn’t want to wake up the sweet sleeping\nWooloo, right? Better to take the long way round.
Let’s go and meet Lee at the station!\nIt’s dead ahead from here![VAR 0114(0005)]
My Wooloo simply loves the Pokémon Center.\c\nCome along, Wooloo!\nYou’re perfectly healed! Time we go back home!
Meeeeeeh...
I lost to the Trainers out training their\nteams on Route 2... I just can’t believe it...\c\nGive me a moment to process, would you?\nI’m in shock here.
The Slumbering Weald is over this way!\nLet’s go find that Wooloo![VAR 0114(0005)]
I believe the chairman was quite clear.\nGet your Water Badge at once.[VAR 0114(0007)]
You must be a Gym Challenger, right?\c\nIf you’re looking for the Gym Leader, Nessa,\nshe’s off at the lighthouse.\c\nThe lighthouse is, well... If you head toward the\nsea from here, you shouldn’t be able to miss it.
We’re blockin’ off this route to get in the way\nof Gym Challengers—you got that?\c\n“Our Marnie’s all done with Hulbury!\nOur Marnie’s all done with the sea!\r\nOur Marnie defeats every leader,\r\nand she’ll bring us all sweet victory!”
Team Yell’s hard at work trainin’ up our Pokémon\nt’be extra hard here in Galar Mine No. 2!
Can’t you see we’re practicin’ our chants here?!\c\n“You’re not passin’!\nYou’re not passin’!\r\nYou’re not passin’, not through here!\r\nYou’ll not get through till we’re all done here!”
Can’t you see we’re practicin’ our cheers here?!\n“M-A-R-N-I-and-E! That’s how we spell victory!”
You just can’t silence Team Yell!\c\n“She’s cute! She’s tough!\nShe won’t take no one’s guff!\r\nOoour Marnie! She’s our Marnie!”
You just can’t silence Team Yell!\c\n“Glory, glory, to our Marnie!\nGlory, glory, to our Marnie!\r\nGlory, glory, to our Marnie!\r\nAs our girl goes marchin’ on!”
Excuse me! You need permission to enter the\nvault here in Hammerlocke!
You can’t drown us out, mate!\nWe’ll just turn the volume up!\c\n“M-A-R N-I-E!\nThat spells victory to me!\r\nWith the knick-knack paddywhack,\r\ngive Growlithe a bone...\r\nMarnie’s gonna send you home!”
[~ 34]
Corviknight is a Pokémon that flies all about\ncarrying people where they want to go.\r\nBut even they get tuckered out...
Hmm? You don’t have the Fire Badge yet.\c\nYou can’t enter without the Fire Badge.\nWould you like me to take you back to the\r\nbridge at the Motostoke Riverbank?
Got it! Then come with me!
Got it! Well, don’t push yourself too hard.\nSet up camp or something when you need a rest!
My Corviknight got all rested up, so it’s already\nheaded off on its next Poké Job!

It’s a mailbox that Pokémon collect letters from!
There are so many books!\c\nThe ad says the magazine with a special feature\non all the Gym Leaders is the most popular.
It’s a record shop.\nApparently you can find some rare records here.
[~ 22]
[~ 23]
[~ 24]
[~ 25]
This city is just massive!\c\nI need to keep checking my Town Map,\notherwise I know I’ll get lost!
Here in the Galar region, I’d say it’s fair to call\nthe Champion a regional hero.\c\nWe’re all transfixed by everything he does!
You gotta throw Poké Balls!\c\nThrow them over and over to get your pitching\ntechnique sorted!
Leon throws his Poké Balls with so much energy!\nI wonder if the Pokémon inside get dizzy?
Churu churu.
[~ 31]
It’s wonderful that there’s space for Steenee to\nrelax and enjoy itself.\c\nIn fact, I’m tempted to join it and quench my\nthirst, too!
We use the Pokémon move Growth to raise our\nflowers, so they get rather large!
I always bring flowers home—on special days or\neven normal days.\c\nMy Pokémon loves the scent of flowers so much.
I love flower Pokémon!
Shrinking down to fit in Poké Balls, and the next\nthing you know, growing massive by Dynamaxing...\c\nIt must be a lot of work for Pokémon!
Minci minci minci!
Minccino likes things neat and tidy.\nIt’ll brush away any dust with its tail!
I see that you’re working on a Pokédex!\c\nYou’ll meet lots of different Pokémon if you head\nto the Wild Area.
There’s something satisfying about actually being\nable to hold the products when you shop.\c\nThen again, buying things online and having\nPokémon deliver them to you has its own charm.
You can really tell a person’s character by\ngoing shopping with them.\c\nMy husband...well...he doesn’t think too much\nabout what he buys.
Grrrarock!
Onix is big, but it can get even bigger\nby Dynamaxing!
Howzit? I came all the way from Alola\nto watch the Gym Challenge in person!
If I could choose my own uniform number, which\none should I pick? I can’t make up my mind!
I can’t wear the same uniform as my favorite\nGym Leader. I’d get way too nervous.
Records truly are amazing.\c\nThey bring life back to singers who no longer\ncan sing...
Mr. Rose has a real love for the Galar region.\c\nIt’s not enough to help keep us all supplied with\nenergy—he even supports the Gym Challenge!
Steam power’s amazing!\nIt can even move that giant lift!
I’m always frightened by airplanes and whatnot...\nHow those giant chunks of metal move so fast.\c\nPokémon don’t bother me, though.
I never get tired of watching those giant,\nsteam-powered gears turning!
My Toxel likes tinned food way too much.
There are some Pokémon that just love to battle.\nI guess there’s lots of different ways to live\r\nwith Pokémon!
It’s fun playing with Mandibuzz, but really I wish\nI could fly with it!
Buafuah!
Poen poen.
Come on now, Tympole.\nTime to head home.
In the Galar region, it’s only natural that\nwe help each other out.\r\nThe cleaning I do is just volunteer work!
Even if there’s no point in having a chin-wag, it’s\nstill great to hear the voice of someone you like!
People can change whenever they want—they\njust need to want to change...\r\nMaybe this old man can make a change, too.
Pokémon need PP, or Power Points, to\nperform moves!
It’s fine and dandy to have battles in the city,\nbut you need to make sure you don’t get in\r\nanyone’s way!
I’m playing hopscotch with Wynaut and my\nyounger sister!\c\nDo you know hopscotch? You have to jump\nyour way through the court!
We can play with our Pokémon here!
Wy wynaut.
Once I get my new hairstyle, I’m going to stop by\nthe Rotomi at the Pokémon Center to update my\r\nLeague Card!
I do my best every day and cheer on my favorite\nGym Leaders...\c\nYou really don’t get tired of doing the things\nyou love!
Some people say they like Pokémon because of\nhow strong they are, but I think that their\r\ncuteness is part of their appeal, too!
The Gym Challenge is a journey, you know.\c\nYou travel throughout the region, together with\nyour Pokémon.\c\nRemember, if you were able to take the first step,\nthe second step is never quite as hard.
I know old folks like us can get carried away\noffering advice, but the most important thing for\r\nyoung ones like you is to live the way you want.
Mworp!
Well? What do you think about our secret hideout?\nWe want to make a new Gym!
I bet we would make it the best Gym in Galar\nin like two years!
The Gym Leaders battle each other separately\nfrom the Gym Challenge in order to determine\r\nwho is stronger.
Don’t you wish people could use Pokémon\nmoves, too?\c\nI mean, I bet I could unleash an amazing\nHyper Beam!
Most of the companies here in Galar are owned\nby Chairman Rose!
My favorite person is the Champion!\nMy favorite word is “strongest”!
Ah, Motostoke Stadium!\nThis is where the opening ceremony is held!\r\nExhibition matches are super exciting, too!
You’re participating in the Gym Challenge?\nI bet you have some dependable Pokémon, then.
You’ve got the Fire Badge!\nThat’s wicked, mate!
The Gym Leaders will show up for the\nGym Challenge opening ceremony.
You’re a challenger, right?\nDon’t let those Gym Leaders beat you!
I was watching your match!\c\nI literally shouted with excitement when you\ndefeated Kabu!
The stadium is so huge!\nI wonder how many houses would fit inside?
The stadium can even handle\nDynamax Pokémon battling inside!\c\nIt is said that long, long ago there was a giant\nstadium made entirely out of stone.
[~ 86]
I feel like that challenger named Bede has\nsome potential!\r\nI bet he’ll pull off something incredible!
My favorite is Leon’s Charizard!
Everyone participating in the Gym Challenge\nis welcome to stay at the Budew Drop Inn.
We League staff are here to provide support\nfor the various matches that occur throughout\r\nthe Gym Challenge.
Go, Gym Challenger!\nLooking forward to it!
Do your best!
I’m cheering for you!
Give it your best shot!
Yeah!\nSo cool!
Go! Go all the way!\nJust keep going!
Oh! You’re that challenger\neveryone’s talking about.
You’re gonna face Kabu?\nWell, good luck!
Kabu’s a strong Trainer.\nThat’s for sure!
Go all out!
All the Gym Leaders...\nright here!
You’re an amazing Trainer,\ndefeating Kabu and all!
[~ 103]
Great weather, eh, mate?
I can’t believe Kabu lost!\nWhat a match!
Hey, Champion!\nThanks for everything!
Good day to you!
Hey there!\nThat was a good match!
I heard Kabu’s training his\nteam all over again.
Something good happen?
I wish something good\nwould happen.
Guess I should go look for\nsomething good.
That meal was a delight!
Time for some Max Raid\nBattles in the Wild Area!
I can’t find the TR that I\nreally want...
The Gym Challenge!\nThe Gym Challenge!
I want to battle Leon!
Where’d Leon go?
Cooking while camping is\njust fantastic!
Curry’s kind of like\nstew, right?
I hear curry’s really popular\nin places like Kanto.
It’s so soothing to see\nPokémon playing in the city.
My hobby’s going camping\nand playing with Pokémon!
I bet I could become a\ncamping master!
Oh! You’re the Gym\nChallenger I’m cheering for!
I’m gonna buy the uniform\nof my favorite Gym Leader!
Your uniform number is\nsuper popular!
Pardon.
Yeah, that makes sense.
That’s about right.
Speed is important!\nIt lets you attack first!
TMs are great!\nThey never break!
The Rotom Rally!\nThe Rotom Rally!
Poké Balls!\nGreat Balls!
Ultra Balls are ultra-great!
Master Balls are a sure catch!
Dynamaxing makes your\nPokémon become huge!
Gigantamaxing changes your\nPokémon’s look!
You can win a Master Ball\nthrough the Loto-ID.
Mworp!
Bworp!

Have you visited Hammerlocke Stadium yet?\nIt looks super rugged!
I’ve been told that Hammerlocke’s Gym Stadium\nis located right in the center of the Galar region!
Noibat loves fruit! It’s always looking for it\nusing ultrasonic waves!
Squilili squililili!
Hi there, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0302)]r.iss Trainer! Have you edited your\nLeague Card at all?\c\nAs you gather material for it, it becomes harder\nand harder to decide what you want to use.\r\nIt’s so much fun!
I have a friend who told me that he dresses up\nas a Pokémon and does Poké Jobs.\c\nBut it’s not me—it’s a friend!
I saw the ruins at Stow-on-Side, but...\nI don’t really get art sometimes...
She keeps going on about art, but really all that\nmatters is whether you like what you see or not.
These clothes I’m wearing, they were given to me\nback when I was a student.\c\nThey’re made from durable Pokémon silk, so I\nbelieve they’ll last me a good while yet!
Not too many Gym Challengers make it all the\nway to Raihan...\c\nI really wish we could see more matches with him\nand his Pokémon.
Opal’s been a Gym Leader for several decades—\nthe very definition of a seasoned veteran...\c\nI doubt you’ll stand a chance.
Chairman Rose himself once participated in the\nChampion Cup. He really took off after\r\nthe Semifinals!
I heard that the Meowth of Galar look different\nfrom the Meowth of Kanto or Alola!\r\nI think it’s called a regional form!
I like my curry sweet, but then my father always\nadds too much bitter seasoning!
A lot of people buy replicas of Leon’s uniform,\nbut nobody can wear it ’cause the cape’s\r\ntoo heavy...
We agreed to meet at the Pokémon Center, but\nI’ve been here awhile, and still no sign...\c\nMaybe I should go check the other\nPokémon Centers?
Gastrodon, I choose you!\nSQUEEEAAA-SQUISHY-SQUISHY-SQUISH!
Rhydon against Gastrodon!\nI’m at a disadvantage in terms of type matchup,\r\nbut experience is on my side!
Todon...
Do don!
I saw a Pokémon sucking nectar from a flower, so\nI decided to copy it!
I wish there were boxed lunches you could eat on\nthe train. They’d be so popular!
Children can’t get through the Wild Area,\nso we have to ride the train.\c\nIt’s safe! We don’t need an adult to ride with us!
At that restaurant, the Pokémon is better at\ncooking my food to perfection.
We all know that dragons guard treasure!\c\nIt’s definitely fitting that Raihan’s the guardian of\nthe vault.
They say that the Galar region has lots of\nold buildings!
I’ve heard that Pokémon in the Wild Area\nhide all sorts of things in their dens.\c\nThere’re apparently even odd Pokémon that\ncollect TRs!
You really should visit Wyndon sometime.\nPeople from all over the world gather there!
Kwaaa!
I wonder if there’s something special about\npeople who find Wishing Stars?
Once I become Champion, I’m going to gather\nall the Wishing Stars in the world and give them\r\nto you!
The curry I made while camping was amazing,\nbut the curry I made at home was only so-so...\r\nI wonder what was different?
Oh, are you headed to Stow-on-Side,\nGym Challenger?\c\nEveryone knows that Route 6 leads on to\nthat good old town!
Hey, this is the final Gym!
You did it!\nYou got the Dragon Badge!
The stadium...\nNot good. This is not good!
Next is Wyndon!\nTime for the big event!
I saw your match in the\nstadium! It was incredible!
What a match!\nThe best battle of this year!
Let’s go, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nLet’s go!
I’ll be cheering for you during\nthe Semifinals!
Here [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she comes!\nIt’s that Trainer!
Oh! I know that Trainer!\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe’s super strong!
Hello!
Think only of victory!
Your matches help me\nfeel brave!
How are things?
You’re stronger than Raihan!\nThat’s amazing!
The Champion’s Pokémon\nare looking good!
Now, where did my Pokémon\nwander off to...
It’s tough trying to find a\nPokémon that can fly.
Turns out my Pokémon was\nat home the whole time!
Amazing!
Am I ever thirsty...\nI wish I had some tea...
I want to go on a trip with my\nPokémon, but where to?
It really makes my blood boil\nwhen I lose a battle!
Time for the Champion Cup!
That red light...\nIt was so scary...
The vault is outside of\nthe stadium.
I heard that underneath the\nstadium is a power plant!
These stadiums...\nSuch odd buildings.
I want a cool Pokémon to\nbe my partner!
My favorite move is Teatime!
My favorite Ability is\nHunger Switch!
My five favorite Pokémon?\nOh, I can’t decide...
I want all the clothes from my\nfavorite brand.
My favorite Trainer is\nthe Champion!
It’s a stone statue of a Poké Ball.\nThere’s a rumor that if you touch it, you’ll have\r\nbetter luck catching Pokémon.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : z_c0301

Muuurrrrrrfff!
Wow...\nThis Pokémon is huge...
I’m glad we live in a world where I can coexist\nwith a giant Pokémon like this!
[~ 3]
[~ 4]
If you’re sitting, you have to stand up eventually,\nright? In the same way, even if you’re defeated,\r\nsooner or later you’ll get back on your feet.
[~ 6]
Mima mime!
You can tell Leon absolutely loves to battle.\nJust look at his smile!
Pokémon Trainers are really amazing!\nI mean, they can compete on the world stage!
Mr. Rose used the power of his company to turn\nthis city into a tourist spot, but without ruining\r\nthe historical buildings and streets!
How many companies does Mr. Rose own again?
[~ 12]
[~ 13]
This Mr. Mime’s name is Marcel!\nIt’s really amazing!
It must be nice to be a supporter of someone.\nIt’s not easy to be so dedicated to a stranger!
If a Trainer I’m cheering for loses, it really brings\nme down, as if I was the one who lost!\c\nEven if the match itself has nothing to do with\nme, that’s what it means to be a supporter.
Better to raise it from a Charmander. You’ll form\na stronger bond that way.
I’m gonna join the Gym Challenge too, with my\nvery own Charizard!
Hello? Yeah, I got tickets for front-row seats in\nthe stadium! Come on over!
I can’t even keep my siblings under control.\nI don’t think I could handle raising six Pokémon.
I’m pretending to be Falinks!
I’m pretending to be Falinks, too!
Me? I’ve been a fan of Leon since he first\nparticipated in the Gym Challenge!
Anybody can say things like “I’ve been a fan for\na long time!” Or “I’ve watched all his matches!”\c\nIt doesn’t prove that you’re a real fan!
Marnie gave me her autograph just now!\nIt’s my treasure!
Isn’t this a huge Ferris wheel?\nIt’s known as the Galar Hurricane.
Don’t listen to my sister—she’s just making\nthings up.
Bridges connect two separate things, so they\ncan be seen as symbols of friendship, too!
When I see a truly amazing battle, it fills my\nwhole body with energy!\c\nI’ve got all the respect in the world for Trainers\nwho can put on matches like that!
Pokémon that work in the hotels and Pokémon\nthat participate in battles...\r\nThey all have a sharp look to them!
[~ 31]
Brrrheeeim!
This kind Pokémon carried us all the way to\nthe hotel.
You’ve gotta give it to Mudsdale.\nI’ve never seen it overloaded, no matter how\r\nmany people are riding it!
I can change my job or even my home, but I can’t\nchange my favorite challenger and my\r\nfavorite Pokémon!
Growlithe!\nI’ll race you to the stadium!
Raihan likes to use Sandstorm first!
I’ll use my speedy Pokémon to defeat any\nPokémon that try to change the weather!
Bork!
[~ 40]
Exactly! My Growlithe lost so much weight!
Running a full circle around Wyndon certainly\nburns a lot of calories...
I clean so that I can properly appreciate the\nbeauty of the flowers.
I’m going for a picnic with my Pokémon!
I cross the bridge one way feeling anticipation\nfor the match I’m going to watch, and then I\r\ncross the bridge the other way feeling excited\r\nafter seeing an amazing match!
We can just walk to the stadium, but challengers\nhave to win if they want to reach it...
I wonder how many houses would fit inside\nWyndon Stadium?!
You never know the weather until you wake up.\nYou never know who will win until it’s done.
Everybody in the world watches the same match.\nThat means everybody in the world can talk to\r\neach other about that same match!
Great matches will always be remembered by\nthe crowd!
Kantonians and Galarians both seem to like\nwaiting in lines...
Get your official merchandise here!\nWe also have League Cards!
I came looking for rare League Cards, but they’re\nall sold out!
Today’s weather is perfect for a match!\c\nI mean, I say that for any weather, and the\nstadium has a roof, but still.
Would you care for some Pokémon snacks\nor Pokémon drinks?
I wasn’t thirsty at all, but all these juices look so\ngood that now I feel parched!
Challengers are just too amazing...\c\nAny mistake they make is seen by tens of\nthousands of fans, but the challengers just keep\r\non battling as if it were nothing.\c\nThey must all have nerves of steel!
He says he likes someone who’s fun to be with,\neven when they’re eating their usual food.
I think the reason why we feel restaurant food is\nso much better than normal food is because of\r\nthe novelty of it all.
We’ll show you the full power of Team Yell!
We’re gonna stay out of trouble this time.\nI mean, we want to watch the matches, too!
[~ 62]
I’m not gonna go into the stadium just yet.\nI want to enter it as a challenger!
Welcome, Challenger!\nPlease, battle to your heart’s content!
Time for the final match...\nEveryone’s got their eyes on you!
That was the best match I’ve ever seen!
Welcome, Challenger!\nPlease, battle to your heart’s content!
This might be the first time we see a Trainer\ndefeat Leon.
I...I’m speechless...\nThat was just...amazing...
Leon, Leon, the greatest Champion ever! ♪\nLeon, Leon, will he be beaten? Never! ♪
My sister just keeps singing Leon’s cheering song!
Charizard’s Max Flare is different from any\nother Pokémon’s!
I won’t lie—I started cheering for Leon because\nmy child is a huge fan.
I’m taking as many pictures as I can.\nThey’re like little slices of time.
I feel like my Pokémon always smiles when we\ntake photos together.
Cheeez!
I’ve got my eyes set on Wyndon Stadium!
[~ 78]
Kraw! Kraw!
[~ 80]
Krow row!
[~ 82]
Cheers!
Nothing like a good match\nto spice up your day.
Amazing matches make me\nwant to work hard, too!
Much obliged.
Much obliged!
Much obliged!!!
Good day!
Kids have their whole future\nahead of them!
The future’s in your hands,\nChampion!
I can’t wait to see\nDynamax Pokémon!
Being able to see Pokémon\nGigantamax is the best!
So, Sonia’s finally decided\nto become a professor, eh?
The Champion’s match!
Oh man, I can’t believe\nHop lost...
I love Leon, but I love the\nnew Champion, too!
So many people!\nIt’s a little intimidating...
People from all over the\nworld gather here, huh!
The Galar region’s growing\non me.
I always bring up the weather\nwhen meeting new people...
I can’t stop myself from\nsaying what’s on my mind.
There were Pokémon in the\nSlumbering Weald after all!
I train myself together with\nmy Pokémon!
The important thing about\ntraining is to never give up.
A strong will is the secret to\nbecoming a strong Trainer!
Yaaay!\nI’m a Charizard!
I’m gonna Dynamax someday!
I swear I’ll beat the Champion!
This city’s huge...\nLet me check my Town Map.
Even kids can ride the\nFlying Taxis!
I like the monorail, too.\nI think it’s kinda cute!
There must be at least one\nninja around here...
Was there a Pokémon that\nwas like a ninja?
Maybe I’ll challenge the\nChampion myself!
I’ve got my Charizard pose\ndown pat!
I feel a new Champion is\nabout to be born!
I need to get all the official\nmerchandise!
At last!\nThe final match!
The final showdown...\nThis is so exciting!
Hey, it’s [VAR 0100(0000)]!
Strong and noble!\n[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)] is the best!
I’m cheering for you both!\nShow us a good match!
Go on!\nShow us what you can do!
Please!\nCan I have an autograph?!
Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]!
If you want to get around Wyndon, you’ve come\nto the right Flying Taxi, guv’nor! Where’d you like\r\nto go?
The Rose of the Rondelands Hotel
Wyndon Stadium
Monorail Station
Rose Tower
Battle Tower
Never mind
You got it, guv!\nLet’s get moving, Corviknight!
Aw, that’s too bad.\nWell, let me know if you ever need a ride!
All right, guv, here we are!\nJust come to me if you need a ride again!
Talkin’ to me ain’t gonna help you find the\nbad guy, now is it? I’ll cheer you on, so go out\r\nthere and track him down![VAR 0114(000D)]
Urara!
So there are good League staff members,\nand then there’s this bad League staff member,\r\nand the only difference is that the bad one is\r\nwearing sunglasses?\c\nWhy even bother with the different look, then?
If I were this bad League staff member, I’d just\nlose the sunglasses...
We’re crazy busy because of the Champion Cup,\nand yet I can’t get to Rose Tower...\r\nSome League staff aren’t doing their jobs!
There are some League staff that’ve gone and\nstarted up a fan club dedicated to Ms. Oleana...
I’ve heard that the Champion and Chairman Rose\nare having a very important discussion right now...\c\nI wonder what it’s all about?
It’s finally time for the Champion Cup!\nBeing super busy makes you want to slack off,\r\ndoesn’t it?
I want to get to Rose Tower but the monorail\nisn’t moving...
There’s no sign of that bad League staff!\nWhere’d they go?!
I’m looking for something to\nlook for!

The Gym Leader of Spikemuth, Piers, specializes\nin Dark-type Pokémon.\r\nHe’s a decent bloke, though.
That cape with all the logos...\nWas that the Champion running by?!
With the shutter down, nobody’s going to be\nable to attempt the Gym Challenge.
I hope everything is OK in Hammerlocke...
All this red light!\nIs it Dynamax light?

If you want to heal up your Pokémon, there’s\nnothing like setting up your camp and cooking\r\nthem a good meal. Here, you can add this Berry\r\nto the pot!
If you ever come across a tent, check it out to\njoin the camp of whoever set it up.\c\nIf you’d like, you’re welcome to visit my camp\ntoo—it’s this one right here!
If your precious Pokémon get injured, don’t\nforget to heal them up with a Potion!\c\nAnd you need Antidotes to fix up poison.\c\nJust remember to stock up on items, and you\nwon’t have to visit Pokémon Centers so often!

I heard that Leon has a younger brother...\c\nI bet he’s an amazing Trainer, just like Leon!
All around here is just quiet countryside,\nbut wait until you see a big city.\c\nIt’ll take your breath away!
Pokémon become stronger by battling.\c\nBut how you raise them is where you get to show\noff your skills as a Trainer.
Leon’s just amazing!\nHe’s a superstar to everyone!
The Charizard pose!\c\nJust doing the pose along with Leon makes me\nfeel like I’ve gotten stronger!
In the morning, my Pokémon wakes me up, and\nin the evening, I put my Pokémon to bed...\c\nI can’t imagine a life without Pokémon!
I’ve just remembered what the sign here\nused to say.\c\n“To the right is the Pokémon Lab.\nOn the opposite side is the station.”
I used to want to be a professional Pokémon\nTrainer when I grow up!\c\nBut I can’t think about Pokémon day in and day\nout, the way Leon does...
It’s fun to do some shopping in a boutique!\c\nEven just getting a new hat can change your\nwhole look!
If you’re looking for the Pokémon Professor, you\ncan usually find her at her lovely home by the\r\nlake, enjoying the slow life.
Basics for Pokémon Trainers, lesson one!\c\nThe Pokémon at the top of your team will be the\nfirst one to enter battle!

Milo does more than just work the fields.\nHe raises beautiful flowers, too!
Fluff fluff...
If you hold flowers, Pokémon will gather\naround you!
The League Cards of Gym Leaders tell all sorts\nof stories.
You can challenge the Gyms as many times\nas you want.\c\nI guess it’s to test your unbreakable will!
If you’ve never seen it before, you should really\ngo see the amazing scenery from the hilltop.\c\nIn fact, you should go see it again even if you\nhave seen it before.
That geoglyph... I heard nobody knows its name.\nMaybe it was a forbidden name or something...
I took a photo of the geoglyph, but it just\ndoesn’t compare to seeing it yourself.\c\nStill, looking at the photo is enough to bring\nback a rush of emotions!
How can a geoglyph drawn ages ago last for so\nlong without eroding away?\c\nIt’s so perplexing! If I think too much about it,\nI won’t be able to sleep.
You know what I think?\c\nI think the geoglyph was created with the help\nof Pokémon.
I wanna stick my head into the photo stand-in\nwhen I grow taller!
Such mysterious stone structures...\c\nWere they made by people...or by Pokémon?
If you don’t take proper care of your equipment,\nit can fail you when you really need it.
Route 5 is really long...\nIt feels good to speed through it, though!
More people are coming to\nsee the geoglyph these days.
You could say Milo raised all\nthe Trainers here!
The new Champion is\npretty amazing!
Time for the Gym Challenge.\nHow exciting!
I can’t believe Milo lost...
Hey, is that the Champion...?
Wait, I have to wait my turn\nfor the Gym Challenge?!

I feel like the time you spend trying to make up\nyour mind is the true essence of shopping.

Mew meowow.
Why does Nessa love the lighthouse so much...?
Galar is a huge island.\c\nLighthouses have always been really important in\nhelping ships find their way.
When you see one of those giant Pokémon\nwhile fishing in the Wild Area, it feels like\r\nit’s either catch or be caught!
Nessa’s really stoic about Pokémon.\nShe’s made her Gym mission really tough!
I remember when I did the Gym Challenge...\nI never did get the Water Badge.
I’ve got high hopes for you!\nI mean, I say that to every challenger, of course.
Freshly harvested veggies! Look good, don’t they?\nFreshly gathered Berries! I guess they look good?
Mistakes aren’t that bad when you cook with\nyour mates. At least they make for funny stories!
Galar Mine No. 2 is a good spot.\nIt’s full of rock-solid Pokémon.
Truuummm!
Chairman Rose!
Can I have an autograph?!
I bet it’s gonna be tough to\ndefeat Nessa.
You defeated Nessa! You’re\nquite the Trainer!
Eternatus...\nWhat in the world was that?
Just keep going, me.\nJust keep going and going.
Nessa always gathers the\nbest food!
I’m aiming for the title of\nChampion now, too!
Nothing’s biting...
Maybe I’ll head to the Wild\nArea to do my fishing...
Where’s a good fishing spot?
I got an autograph from\nthe chairman!
Maybe I’ll head over to\nthe Captain’s Table.
Gotta love that ocean breeze\nblowing through!
Let’s see, what’s the specialty\nof Hulbury...?
The local specialty is seafood!\nGood, I already ordered some.
Maybe I’ll stay here forever!
Hi there, Gym Challenger!
Good job on the\nWater Badge.
Hello, Champion!
Nessa does seem to love\nthe lighthouse...
What’s the deal with those\nTeam Yell goons?!
I hear there’s a Pokémon\nthat’s a great detective!
It’s a record shop.\nApparently you can find some rare records here.

We’re using the mural to bring more business\nto our town!\c\nActually, we’ve been doing that for a long\ntime, now.
Raca raca taaa...
Shashakaaay!
My uncle’s Pokémon here is slacking off.\nThe Pokémon that we hired for the Poké Job is\r\nlooking sharp, though!
Come on! Let’s play with Bronzong!
Zudadadada!
Um, um, where is your mouth?
I wanna wear Bronzong on my head!
Can Bronzong really make it rain?!

I want to show the Stow-on-Side ruins to\nmy Diglett.\c\nWho knows—maybe it’ll awaken some latent\nartistic talent, right?
What’s going on?!\nI heard a huge noise come from the direction\r\nof the mural!\c\nIs this some sort of surprise event for tourists?
We should let the people at Ballonlea know\nabout what happened with the mural.\c\nLet’s see now... To reach Ballonlea, you have to\nhead through that mushroom forest.
Cap cap.
The places where you can Dynamax your\nPokémon are known as Power Spots.\c\nThe Gym Stadiums of the Galar region are\nbuilt on these Power Spots.
Wh-wh-what’s going on?!\nWhat’s happening at the ruins?
Wh-wh-what’s this? The hero was actually two\npeople and Pokémon?
Quite an impressive Gym Stadium!
Sudden, big noises are a great way to get people\nfeeling uneasy...
I feel it was more artistic before it got destroyed.
The ocean, huh...\nNot a mountain, huh...
I’ve seen you before...\nAre you a Gym Challenger?
That young lady, Sonia...\c\nShe’s researching the truth about the ruins, right?\nCould she be the granddaughter of\r\nProfessor Magnolia?
Some Pokémon live in the mountains, some\nPokémon live in the forests!\r\nSo many different species!
What was that noise...?\nThunder? No, it couldn’t have been...
If you want to get to Ballonlea, you’ll need to\nmake your way through Glimwood Tangle.\c\nRemember, in Glimwood Tangle...\nIt’s important to touch the mushrooms.
Are you a tourist?\nOr a Gym Challenger?
What a match!\nA fantastic battle, that!
It’s the Champion that\ndiscovered the hidden ruins!
I hear the Gym mission\nreally makes you dizzy!
Everyone seems wobbly,\neven if they get the Badge...
Wow, the Champion!\nWicked!
I got some great deals in\nthe market!
I made a huge amount of\nmoney in the market!
The market hasn’t been too\ngood to me recently...
To be honest...I don’t think\nthe mural looks that good.
I can’t wait to catch\nmore Pokémon!
The destroyed mural...\nI liked how messy it looked.
It’s Stow-on-Side’s famous mural.\nIt’s said to be a very deep work of art...
It’s the statues that were hidden behind\nStow-on-Side’s famous mural.\c\nThey depict two heroes and two Pokémon.

Suh suh snoh!
My Clobbopus just spent a good chunk of\ntime in the hot spring.\r\nIts body is toasty warm now!
Igna!
I hear that Pokémon in Poké Balls or Boxes\nare nice and comfortable.
The Hero’s Bath...\nI hear this hot spring has been around since\r\nancient times.
I watch the Gym Leaders’ matches on the giant\ntelly in the stadium!
Dragon-type Pokémon are weak to Ice-type\nmoves! Maybe they don’t like cold, huh?
Muscles! No cold is too cold if you have powerful\nmuscles to keep you warm!
You’re in trouble if your Pokémon gets frozen\nduring a battle! It won’t be able to move!
Are snowmen Pokémon?
I know there are Ice-type Pokémon, but is\nthere such a thing as snowman Pokémon?
[~ 12]
The falling snow hides the Ice-type Pokémon\naround here really well.
Seems like the hot spring’s a perfect temperature\ntoday, too. Only Pokémon bathe in it, though.
It’s easy to get depressed when it’s cold.\c\nBut Darumaka are able to store more strength\nthe colder it gets. I’m jealous!
Rolly roll.
Fliter fliter.
Shhhwaaaaaah.

Ahhh, this is the life!
There are two challengers I’ve got my eyes on—\nChallenger Hop and Challenger Marnie.
We shouldn’t forget about Challenger\n[VAR 0100(0000)], right?
Seems like the hot spring’s a perfect temperature\ntoday, too. Only Pokémon bathe in it, though.
Is that a Persian engraved on this wall?
Goro goh!
The stones paving the ground are quite cold.\nSnow piles up on them in no time.
There are plenty of people who enjoy Pokémon\nbattles, even if they can’t participate in the\r\nGym Challenge. Actually, there are people who\r\ndon’t battle at all, too.
They say this is the hot spring where the hero\nrested his wounded body.
I try to remove chance from my battles as much\nas possible, but sometimes I still feel it all comes\r\ndown to luck...
I thought I was going to lose for sure, but then\nmy Pokémon scored a critical hit!
Iiissse.
The Gym Challenge is\nreaching its end.
I wonder who made it to\nthe tournament?
Becoming the Champion on\nyour first try... Amazing!
I love the snow so much!
I, said the Pokémon.
If rain is the sky crying, then\nwhat is snow?
I’m just keeping an eye\non the town.
I’ve been walking around so\nmuch, I’m almost too healthy!
Nothing like a nice, long\nwalk after a good meal!
I need to get curry toppings\nat Bob’s Your Uncle.
The curry is what brings the\nrice and ingredients together.
All sorts of flavors become\none in curry.
People and Pokémon should\nbe full of energy!
Getting Badges is no trouble\nwith enough energy!
The Gym Challenge was such\na great competition this year!
The ancient hero liked\nthe hot spring, huh?
What exactly did the hero do?
Is the Champion a hero?
The ancient Hero’s Bath.\c\nIt is said that heroes bathed here to heal\nand rest.
Sometimes the only thing to do in the cold\nweather is have an ice cream!
[~ 54]
Ice types are the perfect fit for icy towns!\nSnom is just right at home!

I won’t quit Team Yell!\nI’ll keep cheerin’ for Marnie!
I’m a huge fan of Piers.\nI’d really fancy seeing him in more matches.
At the end of the day, this place’d be more lively\nif there were more Gym Challengers.
Speaking of Piers, he refuses to Dynamax\nhis Pokémon!\c\nBut the chairman tried to move the Gym to\na kinda faraway place near a Power Spot.
Closing the shutter to sabotage the other\nchallengers was right poor sportsmanship.

It probably goes without saying, but...\nhello, Galar! I’m your Champion, Leon!
The chairman is tied up with some business, so I\nhope no one minds me stepping in on his behalf...
in order to lead you all to greater heights\nas Pokémon Trainers of the Galar region!
The time has come for you to battle it out until\nonly the greatest challenger remains!
So, on behalf of the chairman, allow me to say...\nlet the Finals matches begin!

Hello there, Leon and [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nJust letting you know...
I think it’s time I brought about the Darkest Day.\nFor the sake of Galar’s future, of course!
But I’m in a bit of a pickle. The energy released\nby the Darkest Day is too much for us to contain.
I’m sorry it’s come to this. But it’s you who forced\nmy hand, Leon. You refused to listen!

I feel like Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)] has a\nbalanced team, but [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she doesn’t have any way to\r\ndecisively win, you know?
Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nI’ll remember your name from now on!\r\nI’ve always loved how decisive your party is!
I guess the Champion’s going to extend his\nwinning streak again.

Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nRemember, the Semifinals and Finals are just\r\nspeed bumps on your way to facing Leon.\r\nYou have to win!
You made it to the Champion Cup!\c\nThat’s amazing! You really are a powerful\nchallenger now, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nEveryone in Galar wants to see what you can do!
You made it all the way to the Championship\nMatch! You can’t lose now!\c\nYou have to win, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nYou have to beat the unbeatable Leon and bring\r\na new era to Galar!
It’s the great Champion [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nI was the first one to see you had the potential\nto become Champion! Maybe I can become a\r\nTrainer trainer some day since I’m so good at\r\ndiscovering talent!\c\nHee hee... I’m just joking. Seriously though,\ncongratulations! I’m so happy for you!
Ba ba bug!
E-excuse me, but...\ncould I get a handshake?
Of course!
It’d be my pleasure
Th-thank you so much!\nI’m never going to forget this!

I wonder who’ll win?
I can’t tell who’s going to\nfinally win!

It’s Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]!
Give it your best shot!\nNo regrets!

After all, I’ve only got painful memories of it...\nhitting me on the head, that is.
I stumbled upon this buried in the ground.\nWhy don’t you have it?
I don’t plan on being tripped up in my journey,\nso better you to take it than me!
A wild Pokémon was holding this when I caught it.\nTake it!
Do you think Pokémon like these things, too?
I found something amazing just now.\nThink I’ll give it to you!
It’s amazing, so you’d better take proper\ncare of it and not lose it!
Do you know if there’s anything to find\nover yonder?
Seeing all this wide, open space...simply makes\nyou want to run wild, doesn’t it?
I’m gonna find loads of Pokémon!
Hey, fancy meeting you again!\nHope you’re doing well.
[~ 54]
[~ 55]
[~ 56]
I’m crazy strong and flush with cash!\nWhy won’t anyone battle me?!\r\nHow about you? Dare to take me on?
You’re crazy strong, too!\nI’ll teach you a good trick then.\c\nThere are heaps of items lying around the\nWild Area that people have dropped!\c\nGo around picking them up and then selling ’em\noff, and you can be flush with cash, too!
I’ll work on getting even stronger yet, so come\nfind me for another battle sometime!
Ahhh! Winning makes me feel generous, so I\nthink I’ll teach you a good trick!\c\nThere are heaps of items lying around the\nWild Area that people have dropped!\c\nGo around picking them up and then selling ’em\noff, and you can be flush with cash, too!
Hey there! I found a bit of a rare item here in\nthe Wild Area. You want it? Only [VAR 0200(0000)] W!
Looks like we have a deal!\nI hope it helps you out a bit on your adventure!
You enjoying the Wild Area?\c\nYou know some items are easiest to get through\nMax Raid Battles, right?
Hahaha! I guess it does sound a bit suspect\nwhen you stop to think about it, eh?\c\nBut if you change your mind, you know where to\nfind me!
I fished up something brilliant!\nThis is absolutely...brilliant!\c\nWant my brilliant find for a brilliant\nbargain of just [VAR 0203(0000,002C)] W?!
Well, that was a brilliant choice you just made!\nThen here you are! As promised!
Think I’ll fish myself up another brilliant find!
Whaaat?! What a brilliant blunder for you...
All right. Snap to it.\nLet the battle begin!
Oh, yes? Right then.\nRight shame that is.
You don’t have enough Watts, pal...\c\nTry checking out any glowing dens you find to\ngather up some more!
You don’t have enough brilliant beaming Watts!\nYou’d better hurry, or I might hook a better deal!
There’s energy pouring out from the den!
There’s a bit of energy trickling out of the den...
You obtained [VAR 0204(0000,002C)] W!
Heya, all right?\nWe two brothers are known as the Digging Duo!\r\nWe’re digging up treasure here, see?
You’ve got a fair bit of luck finding us here!\c\nIf you’d like to spot us some Watts, we’ll dig you\nup some handy treasures for your adventure!
All right? Let me tell ya... I’ve no lack of stamina,\nbut when it comes to skill, my brother’s the best!\c\nWant me to dig you up some treasure?\nIt’ll only cost you [VAR 0204(0001,002C)] W!\r\nAnd a wee saving of your progress, too.
All right? Let me tell ya... I’ve no lack of skill,\nbut when it comes to stamina, my bro’s the best!\c\nWant me to dig you up some treasure?\nIt’ll only cost you [VAR 0204(0001,002C)] W!\r\nAnd a wee moment to save your progress, too.
Thanks for your support!\nThen I’ll dig up all I can for ya!
Thanks for your support!\nThen I’ll dig up the best find I can for ya!
That right? Sure, sure.\nBut no need to be shy. Come ask us anytime!
That right? Sure, sure.\nCome visit us again anytime, though!
Bingo! It’s [VAR 1302(0000,0000)][VAR 010A(0000)]!
Should I keep digging, then?
Yeah? Probably wise.\nI’ve still got some petrol in the ol’ tank, though.
Phew! I’m all tuckered out...\nI guess that’s probably it for this dig!
I managed to dig up [VAR 0202(0000)] treasure[VAR 1101(0000,0100)]s this time.\nTake good care of [VAR 1101(0000,0402)]itthem!
Oh? What...\nYou haven’t got the Watts!\c\nIf you want more Watts, maybe try searching out\nsome Pokémon Dens and looking into them!
Wait! No! I’m not finished yet!\nI can still keep on digging!
Dig for me!
I’m good
What’s your best record?
My greatest record is [VAR 0202(0000)] treasure[VAR 1101(0000,0100)]s in one go.\nTold you I wasn’t lacking in stamina, eh?
My greatest record is [VAR 0202(0000)] treasure[VAR 1101(0000,0100)]s in one go.\nTold you I wasn’t lacking in skill, eh?
Whoa?! Feast your eyes on this one!\nThis is a mighty rare find, you jammy thing!
You! Yes, you! You’ve got Pokémon with you,\nhaven’t you? You camp with them, don’t you?\c\nAnd you cook alongside them, right?\nDelicious curries will cure them of whatever\r\nails them, you know!\c\nAnd you can get Berries to cook up curries at\ntrees like that one right there! Yes, right there!\c\nAnd if you want more ingredients, talk to me!\nI’ll sell you all my freshest finds for real cheap!
How are you doing, young friend? Would you\nlike me to help see you to the next town?
To Motostoke, please!
To Hammerlocke, please!
No, thanks
[~ 102]
Then simply leave it to me!
Here we are! And when you’ve trained up a bit,\ngive the Wild Area another chance, would you?\r\nShe’s got some fine secrets, she does.
If your Pokémon are ever getting a bit ragged\nout here, set up camp and cook them up a nice\r\nmeal to have them feeling better in no time.
You found a note! Did someone drop it here?\c\n“The large Pokémon you see wandering around\nin the Wild Area are strong!\c\n“If you try battling one and it seems like you’re\nin over your head, try to run! Run like the wind!”
You found a note! Did someone drop it here?\c\n“Cooking at your camp can restore HP to your\nPokémon, and even the PP they need to use\r\ntheir moves over and over!\c\n“Pokémon that have fainted and can’t battle\nany longer will perk right up as well with a piping\r\nhot plate of curry before them!\c\n“Visit Berry trees to collect plenty of Berries,\nso you can always make more curries!”
Hi there!\nWould you like to rest your Pokémon?
Thanks for stopping by!\nWould you like to buy anything before you go?
On your way to Motostoke?\c\nIf you are, you’ll find it just up over that rise\nand to the east!\c\nOnce you find the walls of the city, just follow\nthem till you reach the stairs!
Isn’t there anyone who wants to come join me\nfor a Max Raid Battle?\c\nIf only people would let me know on Y-Comm,\nI’d have them join me in a heartbeat!
You found a note! Did someone drop it here?\c\n“Use the Right Stick to rotate the camera when\nyou’re in the Wild Area!\c\n“And if you press the Right Stick,\nyou’ll find you can see a wider view of things!\c\n“Press the L Button to look straight ahead again!”
You found a note! Did someone drop it here?\c\n“The Wild Area is overflowing with a special sort\nof energy, measured in Watts!\c\n“You can gather Watts yourself from glowing\nPokémon Dens and glowing Pokémon in the wild!\c\n“You’ll also find Trainers in the Wild Area who\nare willing to give you all sorts of items if you’ll\r\njust give them some of your Watts!”

Hello. Do you want to use this and awaken your\nPokémon’s hidden powers?
Hidden Power changes type depending on the\nPokémon that learns it. Somehow I can tell what\r\ntype that move will be.\c\nIf you’d like, I’ll check what type of\nHidden Power your Pokémon will learn.\r\nWould you like to know this?
If you’d like, I’ll check what type of Hidden\nPower your Pokémon will learn.\r\nWould you like to know this?
If this Pokémon were to learn Hidden Power,\nthe move’s type would be [VAR 0103(0000)].
The type of this Pokémon’s Hidden Power is\n[VAR 0103(0000)]!
If you want to know, just ask me.
I don’t think it’s possible for an Egg to use\nHidden Power.
Unfortunately, this Pokémon can’t learn\nto use Hidden Power.

Welcome to the Nursery.\nHow may I help you?
Nice to see a new face around here.\nThis is a Pokémon Nursery.\c\nWe take care of people’s Pokémon here.\c\nWhen people leave two Pokémon with us,\nwe sometimes find Eggs.\c\nIf you’re interested in that sort of thing,\nask the old lady inside to tell you more.\c\nDo you want to leave any Pokémon with me?
Do come back soon.
We found your Pokémon holding an Egg.\nWould you like to take it?
Is that so?\nIn that case, we’ll keep it ourselves.
You received an Egg from the Nursery worker!
Take good care of it, and raise it well.
It looks like your Boxes are all full.\nHave a look at them and come again, won’t you?
[VAR 0101(0000)] is doing just fine.
Your [VAR 0102(0000)] and [VAR 0102(0001)] are\ndoing just fine.\c\nThey really seem to enjoy each other’s company.
Your [VAR 0102(0000)] and [VAR 0102(0001)] are\ndoing just fine.\c\nThey seem to get along all right.
Your [VAR 0102(0000)] and [VAR 0102(0001)] are\ndoing just fine. Though...\c\nThey don’t seem very fond of one another.
Your [VAR 0102(0000)] and [VAR 0102(0001)] are\ndoing just fine. Though...\c\nThey don’t seem to like playing together at all...
I’m afraid you’d be left with too few Pokémon\nif I took any from you now.
You can leave up to two Pokémon with us.\nWhich Pokémon should we look after?
We’re looking after [VAR 0102(0000)] now.\nWhich other Pokémon would you like us to take?
It will cost 1,000 to leave two Pokémon.\nWould you like to leave them both?
It will cost 500 to leave one Pokémon.\nWould you like to leave your Pokémon with me?
That will be an additional 500, please.
Then you can trust us with both [VAR 0102(0000)]\nand [VAR 0102(0001)]! I’ll take fine care of them.
Then leave [VAR 0102(0000)] with me.
Whenever you want to collect your Pokémon,\ndo let me know.
You don’t seem to have enough money...
Things are going just fine. Would you like to take\nyour Pokémon back anyway?
Just a moment, then.\nI’ll go get your [VAR 0102(0000)].
[~ 25]
Would you care to take [VAR 0102(0000)], too?
You don’t have many Pokémon in your party,\nso I can only take one from you just now.
Welcome to the Nursery!\nHow can I help you?
Hello! This here is the Wild Area branch of the\nPokémon Nursery!\c\nWe’re just as capable as the Nursery on Route 5.\nDon’t you worry about a thing!\c\nWill you be leaving any Pokémon with us today?
Come again!
Your Pokémon was found holding an Egg!\nWould you like to take it with you?
If you’re sure, then I’ll keep it myself!
[~ 33]
Take good care of it, and raise it well!

I’m a Pokémon Nursery lady.\c\nI help take care of the Pokémon of Trainers\nlike you.\c\nLately, for some reason, I see some Pokémon\nholding Eggs. It’s mysterious, isn’t it?\c\nIf you want us to take care of your Pokémon,\nplease speak to my sister inside the building.

Which Pokémon shall I take care of?
Don’t be silly.\nThat’s an Egg!

I’m the game director!\c\nThe Rotom Dex is pretty fun, isn’t it?\nIf you manage to fill in some of your Pokédexes,\r\ncome and show me, would you?
I’m the game director!\c\nOh! I know what that face means!\nThat’s a face that says you filled in a Pokédex!\c\nLet’s see what you’ve done...\c\nWhoa! You’ve registered all the Pokémon that\ncan be found on Melemele Island!

That’s just like you! Congratulations!\nYou completed the Ula’ula Pokédex!
I’m the game director!\c\nOh! I know what that face means!\nThat’s a face that says you filled in a Pokédex!\c\nLet’s see what you’ve done...\c\nOh, wow! You’ve registered all the Pokémon\nfor Poni Island!
That’s superb! Congratulations!\nYou completed the Poni Pokédex!
I’m the game director!\c\nOh! Now what is that invigorating expression\nyou’ve got on your face? Could it be?\r\nAre you here to show me a Pokédex?\c\n... ... ...\nOh! Whoooaaa! No way!\c\nYou’ve completed the entire Alola Pokédex!\nIt’s amazing! Amaza-laz-a-ling!\r\nYou’re too much! Cannot compute!
This is really truly an astounding feat!\nCongratulations on completing the Pokédex!
Phew! There!\c\nI’m glad I didn’t mess up the stamp. And...it\nlooks like your Trainer Passport leveled up, too!\c\nCome see me again anytime if you manage to\nfill in another Pokédex!
Phew! There!\c\nI may have stamped that one a bit harder than\nnecessary, but I couldn’t seem to help it!\c\nI feel honored that I get to help a great Trainer\nlike you celebrate your achievement!
I’m the game director!\c\nHey, it’s you again!\nThe master of the Alola Pokédex!\c\nNow that you’ve filled in your entire Pokédex,\nhave fun visiting lots of different facilities and\r\nplaces with your Pokémon. Enjoy Alola!\c\nAnd get along with your Rotom Dex, too!\nThanks again for playing!

I really want to reward you somehow for your\nmastery in Pokédexing!\r\nLet’s see what I can dig out of my pocket...\c\nBoy, I feel like a Picker-Upper!\nMy Secret Base was Gold Rank, by the way.\c\nAnd...ta-da! It’s a Shiny Charm!\nJust having one of these makes it more likely\r\nthat you’ll encounter Shiny Pokémon!
And that’s not all!\c\nHere’s a little something special that would go\nwell on a tireless Trainer like you, who’s been\r\nrunning all around Alola to fill your Pokédex!
You received a set of the Karate Gi Jacket and\nKarate Gi Pants!
And that’s not all!\c\nHere’s a little something special that would go\nwell on a veteran Trainer like you, who learned\r\nAlola inside and out to fill up your Pokédex!
You received a set of a Pokémon Center Nurse\nCap, a Pokémon Center Nurse Top, and\r\na Pokémon Center Nurse Skirt!

It’s a plant with a gentle fragrance.\nPokémon probably like it, too.
When the fireplace isn’t in use, Pokémon come\nin and out through the chimney.
It’s a fridge with some scratches on it.\nDid Pokémon try to open it?
There are a lot of books that look difficult\nto understand.\c\nSome of them are collections of\nProfessor Magnolia’s research.
Do what plants would want instead of what you want.\nIf you keep that in mind, plants will grow.

Fugaaa! Fugagaga!\c\nI’m a Pokémon! Have a battle with me!
Listen for a second.\c\nScorbunny and Sizzlipede are different species,\nbut they’re still both Pokémon.\c\nScorbunny and I are different species, just like\nSizzlipede and I are different, too.\c\nIf you think about it that way, there’s no problem\nwith calling me a Pokémon. I don’t mind.
What? You don’t have to worry about me.\nEven I know it’s pretty lofty logic.\c\nI...I wanted to become a Pokémon once.
You can be one
Well...good luck with that
Hey, I’ve got it! A change of fashion style could\nchange the way I feel, too!\c\nBasically, if I can make myself feel the way a\nPokémon does, it’d be like I became a Pokémon,\r\ndon’t you think?
You! Would you please put on some clothes with\na fiery spirit that embodies my burning feelings?
I appreciate you encouraging me, but I can’t\nfeel like a Pokémon that way.\c\nPlease! Show me some clothes with a\nFire-type design!
What’s this? Is that...? I feel like I’ve completely\nbecome a Pokémon.\c\nWearing a hot, fire-styled outfit can make\nyou feel different. I feel like I’ve become a\r\nFire-type Pokémon!
Thanks for cheering me up! It’s hardly a proper\nreward, but I hope you like it anyway.\c\nAcrobatics is a move that does more damage if\nthe user isn’t holding an item!
I’ve been thinking... If a Cramorant swallowed me,\nand then someone else caught it...\c\nWould I be able to go inside the Poké Ball, too?\nIf I did, I’d be the first person in humanity’s history\r\nto be caught by a Poké Ball.\c\n“Gotcha! A man was caught!” They’d have to say\nsomething like that, right?\c\nBasically that means I’d equal a Pokémon, no?\nYeah. Yeah, definitely “no.”

A treasure lies buried somewhere in Turffield...
According to this treasure map, the trick to\nfinding the treasure lies in the standing stones.\c\n“Seek yourself three standing stones,\nwith Grass before the other ones.\r\nUse well that strength, and find then\r\nthe strength of its strength in the end.\r\nDally not, if you’ve a mind\r\nTo find what time has left behind.”\c\n...That’s what it says, but I can’t make heads or\ntails of it!
What?! You actually managed to find treasure?!\nThat’s amazing! I was completely stuck!
What’s this? Something’s carved into the stone.\nIt says: “Grass.”
What’s this? Something’s carved into the stone.\nIt says: “Water.”
What’s this? Something’s carved into the stone.\nIt says: “Fire.”
What’s this? Something’s carved into the stone.\nIt says: “Flying.”

Please try again.

Now, which Pokémon will I have undergo\nHyper Training?
If it isn’t Lv. 100, it’s not hype enough to\nundergo Hyper Training.
Oh! [VAR 0102(0001)] is already so strong, it\ndoesn’t even need any training!
Would you like to use a Bottle Cap or a\nGold Bottle Cap?

Which stat should I hype up?
[VAR 0109(0000)]: [VAR 0201(0001)]

This Pokémon can’t be trained any further!
You don’t have enough [VAR 1001][VAR 010A(0000)]...

Congratulations, Champion. Here, I’ve got a\nlittle something for you as celebration.[VAR 0114(000A)]

The Wishing Stars that make Dynamaxing\npossible are parts of Eternatus.\c\nAnd when Eternatus was awakened, Dynamax\nenergy flooded the entire region...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Because of that, Dynamax Pokémon were\npopping up all over, causing trouble across all\r\nof Galar.\c\nBut [VAR 0100(0000)] and h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser friends came to\nour rescue.[VAR 0114(000A)]
The Dynamax phenomenon has long been an\nimportant part of Galarian culture.\c\nI hope everyone will use the power of\nDynamaxing correctly in the days to come.[VAR 0114(000A)]
So, young [VAR 0100(0000)].\nPlease, do what you believe is best.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Poor Professor Magnolia...\c\nIt seems she’s quite bothered by the chairman’s\nactions, since she helped carry out so much of\r\nthe researching into Dynamaxing for him.[VAR 0114(0008)]

Evolution is a bit tricky for Pokémon Trainers...\c\nIf a Pokémon evolves, it’ll get stronger, but its\nappearance will change.\c\nDo you want to know how to make your\nPokémon strong without it evolving?
Oh, that’s too bad.\nIf you change your mind, please come back.
OK. I’ll teach you while battling!\nLet’s have a Pokémon battle!
Even though my Dottler hasn’t evolved yet,\nit was hard to take down, wasn’t it?\r\nThe secret is this Eviolite!
If you let a Pokémon that can still evolve hold\nthis Eviolite, that Pokémon’s Defense and Sp. Def\r\nwill go up!

You and your Pokémon...have the potential to\nbecome great friends!\c\nIf you have your Pokémon hold this item, your\nfriendship may grow even stronger!
Have a Pokémon hold the Soothe Bell, and that\nPokémon will grow friendly faster than normal.

Oh, you’re a Pokémon Trainer!\c\nHere, let me give you something nice.\nTry using it on your Pokémon!

Why, hello there, young man.\nAre you interested in weather?
Why, hello there, young lady.\nAre you interested in weather?
Oh, is that so!\nWell then, let me get started...
If the sunlight is harsh during battle...
Fire-type moves become more powerful,\nwhile Water-type moves are weakened!
The sunlight will thaw out any frozen Pokémon,\nand they’ll be immune to being frozen while\r\nthe weather lasts, too!
Moves that use light, like Solar Beam, can be\nperformed in one turn!
The effects of some other moves also get\nenhanced, like those of Growth and Synthesis.
Certain moves, like Thunder or Hurricane,\nbecome less accurate.
If it’s raining during battle...
Water-type moves will become more powerful,\nwhile Fire-type moves get weakened!
Moves that use sunlight, like Solar Beam, also\nget weakened!
Your Pokémon will heal less HP when they use\nmoves like Synthesis or Morning Sun, too.
On the other hand, moves like Thunder or\nHurricane will become sure hits!
If it’s hailing during battle...
any Pokémon that’s not Ice type will take\ndamage every turn!
Moves that use sunlight, like Solar Beam, will\nget weakened!
Your Pokémon will heal less HP when they use\nmoves like Synthesis or Morning Sun, too.
On the other hand, the move Blizzard will\nbecome a sure hit.
If a sandstorm is raging during battle...
Rock-type Pokémon get a boost to their Sp. Def!
Any Pokémon that’s not Rock, Ground, or Steel\ntype will take damage every turn!
Moves that use sunlight, like Solar Beam, will\nget weakened!
Your Pokémon will heal less HP when they use\nmoves like Synthesis or Morning Sun, too.
Whew!\nI got a little carried away there!
Thanks for listening so politely.\nPlease, take this!
You’re the first one to listen to everything I had\nto say about weather...\c\nHere’s a little something extra, just as a\nthank-you!
I’ve gone and tired myself out.\nCome back tomorrow if you’re interested.

So, that means the culprit must be among us![VAR 0114(0042)]
Wait... Who are you?![VAR 0114(0042)]
After all the trouble of deducing things, don’t go\nmessing it up now![VAR 0114(0042)]
*sigh*\nWe’re accused of being criminals...\r\nWill you help us out?
I just want to be let go soon...
Where did my Pokémon go off to...?
*cough*\nI suppose I should introduce myself.[VAR 0114(0042)]
The name’s Howses. Yes, THAT Howses—the\ngreat detective. I’ve been hired by the hotel.[VAR 0114(006D)]
At present I have cornered the culprit of a most\nheinous crime.[VAR 0114(006D)]
And that crime is...[VAR 0114(006D)]
the strange case of who ate the large quantity of\nBerries in the lobby![VAR 0114(006D)]
I’ve gathered the three people who were\npresent in the lobby at the time of the crime...[VAR 0114(006D)]
But because of the noise, my marvelous\ndeductive reasoning seems somewhat muddled\r\nat present...[VAR 0114(006D)]
That’s it! You, interfering child! You will be\nmy assistant![VAR 0114(006D)]
Listen to the stories of each suspect, and find\nthe culprit![VAR 0114(006D)]
Looks like you were unlucky enough to get\ncaught up in this, too...
It was a huge pile of Berries in the lobby, right?\nThere’s no way I could’ve eaten that many.\r\nI’ve been saying that this whole time.
That detective sure seems like trouble,\ndoesn’t he?
I will admit that I saw the mountain of Berries, but\nmy doctor told me to stop eating those things.\r\nI’ve got it in writing right here.
*sigh*\nWhere did my Pokémon go off to...?
Huh? Berries? I didn’t eat them. Hey, you haven’t\nseen my Pokémon around here, have you?
Chewww!
Ah! My Pokémon! Where were you?
Muuunch.
It sure has a lot of Berry juice on its mouth...
Heh heh heh...[VAR 0114(006D)]
After listening to everyone’s accounts, I have\ndeduced the culprit.[VAR 0114(006D)]
Dancer! You are the culprit![VAR 0114(006D)]
What? Why me?
Because you’re a dancer! You move and shake\nyour body so much that you needed all that\r\nfood for extra energy![VAR 0114(006D)]
That’s evidence as clear and sharp as the leek\nof a Farfetch’d![VAR 0114(006D)]
What? What does that even mean? You’re no\ndetective—you’re a fraud!
Wh-who are you calling a fraud?! You can’t be\nreferring to me, the great detective![VAR 0114(006D)]
I can’t deal with this disrespect! I leave it to you!\nYou find the culprit!
*gasp*[VAR 0114(006D)]
Fraud detective... It’s so cruel, I might cry...[VAR 0114(006D)]
You think I’m the criminal, too?!
You’re a fraud, too! A fraud assistant to a\nfraud detective!
Good, you get it.
What? You think I’m the culprit?
Sorry, but you’re totally wrong. I’ll do you a favor\nand keep that a secret. Let’s pretend that didn’t\r\njust happen, OK?
I can’t eat Berries, after all.
Wha?! You think I’m the culprit?
You’re wrong! Think things over more carefully!
Oh!
Cromch?
Could this be the culprit?
Munch...
What? That Skwovet is the one responsible?[VAR 0114(006D)]
Muuunch?
Ah, it’s true! It’s got Berry bits around its mouth!
Oh, you’re right. I see it now that I look\nmore closely.
Yes, it definitely ate the Berries. Definitely...
Muuuncha.
As...[VAR 0114(006D)]
As... As expected of my assistant![VAR 0114(006D)]
Here! Recompense for solving this mystery!\nTake it![VAR 0114(006D)]
Splendid, just splendid! I’m overjoyed![VAR 0114(006D)]
I must be off now. Take care, everyone![VAR 0114(006D)]
Hey, you! Wait just a minute!
Hahaha! I guess I’m supposed to chase after\nhim, too.
Muuunchaaa!
Thanks for solving the case! Skwovet is saying\nyou did good, too.

Of course
Certainly not!
Oh, right...\nSorry for asking such a strange thing of you...
D-did you change your mind, perhaps?\nWill you deliver my letter for me?
Oh, thank you! Thank you!\nI’m so glad I found someone like you to help me!
My name is Paula.\nHere you are. This is the letter I want you to deliver!
Deliver it to Frank for me, won’t you?\nFrank in Ballonlea. That’s who you want.
Please make sure the letter reaches Frank.\nFrank in Ballonlea. You’ll find him, won’t you?
Frank?\nThat’s my grandda’s name.
You’re looking for Frank?\nThat’d be me, yes...
What’s this?\nYou’ve got a letter addressed to me?
You handed the Old Letter to the old man.
Now who could be sending me letters?\nOh! Why, this says it’s from Paula!
That does take me back ages...\c\nPaula was the name of a girl I spent all my time\nplaying with when I was a young lad...
She fell ill. Didn’t tell me, though.\nShe kept it a secret just how sick she was.
We ended up having a great row about it...\nThen I moved away not long after that fight.\r\nI never met her again after the day I left.
How was she?\nDid she look well? Dear old Paula...
She looked well
... ... ...
That’s a comfort to hear.
What?\nThe quiet type, are you? Meowth got your tongue?
I reckon I ought to give you something for this\ngift you’ve brought.\c\nFor you’ve brought me back a piece of my youth.
Do you have a dear friend in your life?\c\nMake sure you treasure those dear to you while\nyou have them close.
What’s this?\nYou found something lying on the ground...
Finding your way through Glimwood Tangle is a\nfair sight easier if you give the mushrooms a li’l\r\nnudge to light them up.
Every time I meet granny Opal, she tells me\nI should wear more pink, the old bat.

Ahhh...\c\nMy delivery guy caught a cold and can’t make\nit today.
You’re the one who dined here with Chairman\nRose, right?\c\nWould you please help us deliver some food?
Oh, sorry for asking something so strange.
Thank you!\nI truly appreciate it!
As for where to deliver the food...\nSorry, I forgot to ask for an address.
I heard a clickety-clack sound from the phone.\nMaybe that’s a clue as to where to go?
Thanks for delivering the food.\nHere—something for your trouble.
Come back sometime for more work!
Back again?\c\nI wanted to ask you to deliver some food again.\nIs that OK?
I don’t know if this helps, but I think I heard\na Pokémon cry over the phone. Like...
The customer told me to look for a green roof,\nbut I wonder if there is such a house in Hulbury.
Thank you for taking care of all the deliveries.\nYou really helped us out.
This is a little token of my gratitude.\nPlease take it.
Welcome!\c\nOh, it’s you. Please relax and stay as long as\nyou’d like.
Oh, are you delivering my food?\nThank you for your trouble!\c\nThis restaurant’s dishes are full of seafood\nand so delicious!
I’ve already paid the restaurant, so I’ll give\nyou candy as a tip!
For someone so young, you sure are\na hard worker!
Ah! I’m starving!\c\nOh, I can smell the ocean.\nYou’re from the restaurant, aren’t you?\c\nI’ve been drooling while waiting for the food!\nThank you for delivering the food!
You get energy from food!\nYou should eat balanced meals!

Psst. Hey, you. You heard the rumor?
I have
I haven’t
Y-you have, huh? I mean, I don’t really care\nor anything...
What? You haven’t heard?!
There’s a rumor that if you give the one you like\nan Applin, you’ll be together forever!
Actually, the truth is, there’s someone I like.
She’s gonna move overseas pretty soon...
I’ve been searching for an Applin so I can\nget my feelings across the right way.\c\nBut I can’t find one...
If you’ve got an Applin, would you please\ngive it to me?
Oh, OK... Sorry to ask for something so weird.\nGuess I’ll look a little more on my own.
Whoa! You mean you’ll really give me\nan Applin?
[VAR 0100(0000)] handed over Applin!
Wow! I did it! I finally got an Applin!
Thank you! Thank you so much!
Since you went through the trouble of giving me\nan Applin...
I’ve got to tell her how I feel!
Sorry I’m late. What was it that you needed to\ntalk about so suddenly?
I... Err... H-how’s your packing going?
Pretty much everything’s been packed.
Since I’m moving away tomorrow...
Yeah...
H-hey! Check out this Pokémon!
Oh, an Applin! Amazing! Did you catch it?
W-well...
N-no. Someone gave it to me.
I’m sorry! I really wanted to give you an Applin\nthat I caught on my own! But, well...
Ah, just forget it! I can’t give you this Applin.
You’re right. I can’t take it.
Yeah...
Even if we’re separated and far away from\neach other...
I’ll still be waiting...for an Applin you\ncaught yourself.
Wait—do you mean...?
Ah, um... I’ll, uh—I’ll see you later!
Say, what do you think that was about, just now?\nDo you think it meant that...?
Good on you!
Congratulations!
Th-thank you?
Wait! Does that mean what I think it means?!
Really, really?! I can’t believe it! Woo-hoo!
Ah, sorry! I just never thought that we both felt\nthe same way.
Right, well, I’d better give this Pokémon back\nto you.
You got back your Applin!
Here, take this, too. Think of it as a reward for\nhelping me take that first step.
I’m going to catch an Applin all by myself!
And then, someday, I’m going to go give her\nthat Applin!
Yeah! I’d better get searching for an Applin!
Thanks again, mate. See ya!
Uh... I appreciate you wanting to help me out,\nbut maybe you should make sure you actually\r\nhave an Applin?

Electric Memory—on! This’ll help save on the\nelectric bill!
Gumuuu?
Guess it really doesn’t work until Type: Null\nevolves. Drat...
Oh, Champion [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nIt probably goes without saying at this point, but\ncongratulations on your victory!
To commemorate your achievements, I present\nyou with this rare Pokémon—Type: Null!
Ah, and these, too.

Once Type: Null evolves, its type will change\ndepending on which memory you have it hold.
Ah, Champion! Are you taking good care of\nType: Null?

Can I help?
I don’t have time to help right now...
Waaaaaaaaah!
Huh? You’ll help me look for Minccino?\nOh, thank you so much!
My Minccino really likes to play in the water,\nand it also likes the sound of whistling!\c\nI bet it’s hiding somewhere where there’s lots\nof water.\c\nBut I can’t think of a place with lots of water here\nin Motostoke...\c\nIt has a weird cry that sounds like “Mworp,” so\nif you hear that cry, try whistling!

Mworp...?
It’s the missing Minccino!
Minccino went back to the boy.
[~ 10]
Minccino?\nNo, I’m just an old man.
I come here secretly to freshen up, but I guess\nI’ve finally been found out!
Let me give you a little something to remember\nour meeting!
Now then, I must be on my way!\nFarewell! Ha ha ha ha!
The man went home!
That’s my Minccino!
Minccino came back!\nThanks for helping me find it!
Please take this.\nIt’s my way of saying thank you!
Minccino is my best friend. But it’s so full of\nenergy, I can’t take my eyes off of it!

You’re really strong!\nI should’ve known!
Since you’ve managed to trounce me, I guess\nyou’ve earned yourself a reward.
Let’s have ourselves a rematch someday!
You seem to keep motoring right over ol’\nMorimoto. Let’s see who wins the next time!
I’m all tuckered out for today.\nHow about tomorrow for a rematch?
And here [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she is!\nReady for that match?
And...go!\c\nAwww, I missed again?!\nIt’s harder than it looks to get a catch!\c\nHmm? You...\c\nYou look like you’d know the proper way to\nthrow a Poké Ball!
I’m a planner!\c\nMy job is think of ways to play, so I suppose that\nmeans that playing itself is my job!
Hear that background music?\nYup, I made that!
We came here to research a bit.\nBut the Galar region is lovely, isn’t it?\c\nThe best part of all had to be enjoying the\ndifferent toppings on all the curries.\r\nCurry is a big hit in Kanto, too, you know!
Do you like Pokémon?
Well, thanks for that!\nI hope you’ll always love them!
Oh, I get it...\nYou don’t just like them. You love them, right?
I’m completely obsessed with Rotom Rally!\nI can’t get enough of it!

Forget a move
Quit
Rate a nickname
Check a Pokémon’s memories
Well, come back anytime.
So, you’re the new Champion!\c\nI can put any of your Lv. 100 Pokémon\nthrough Hyper Training.
What’s this? Seems you don’t have any\nBottle Caps or Gold Bottle Caps.
Now, which Pokémon will I put through\nHyper Training?
If it isn’t Lv. 100, it’s not hype enough to\nundergo Hyper Training.
Oh! [VAR 0102(0001)] is already so strong, it\ndoesn’t even need any training!
Would you like to use a Bottle Cap or a\nGold Bottle Cap?
You want me to hype up all of this Pokémon’s stats?
Which stat should I hype up?

The training starts now!
This Pokémon can’t be trained any further!
You don’t have enough [VAR 1001][VAR 0109(0000)]...
Phew... [VAR 0102(0000)] got stronger from the\nHyper Training.
Want to keep the hype going with some more\nHyper Training?
What move shall I teach?

Draco Meteor
Frenzy Plant
Hydro Cannon
Blast Burn
Fire Pledge
Water Pledge
Grass Pledge
Which Pokémon should learn my move?
Which Pokémon should I have remember\na move?
Which Pokémon should I have forget a move?
Hm? This move is quite rare. If your Pokémon\nforgets this move, it won’t be able to relearn it.\r\nSo I’ll teach it another rare move for you.
[VAR 0102(0001)] can’t learn my move.
[VAR 0102(0001)] already knows my move.
[VAR 0102(0000)] learned [VAR 0107(0001)]![VAR BE05(0004)][VAR BE05(0001)]
There are rare moves that your Pokémon can’t\nlearn by leveling up or by using TMs or TRs!\c\nIf you’re interested, I can teach them to\nyour Pokémon.
You want one of your Pokémon to forget a\nmove? If you want your Pokémon to use a move\r\nit’s forgotten, it’ll have to relearn the move first.\r\nSo be careful.
I can have your Pokémon remember any move\nthey should’ve had the chance to learn up until\r\nwhere they are now.
It doesn’t seem like that Pokémon has any moves\nthat it can forget.
It doesn’t seem like that Pokémon has any moves\nthat it can remember.
Huh? You can’t choose an Egg! It hasn’t even\nhatched yet!
[VAR 0102(0001)] has already learned the\nspecial move.
Would you like me to teach this move to another\nof your Pokémon?
Is there another Pokémon you’d like me to help\nremember some moves?
Would you like me to have your Pokémon forget\nany other moves?
Shall I stop having your Pokémon forget moves?
Shall I stop having your Pokémon remember moves?
Shall I stop teaching your Pokémon moves?
Shall I stop the Hyper Training?
[VAR 0102(0000)] has gained newfound\ndetermination and changed to its Resolute Form!

One...[WAIT 20]two...[WAIT 20]and...[WAIT 20][WAIT 20]ta-da![VAR BE05(0003)][VAR BE05(0000)]\c\n[VAR 0102(0000)] forgot [VAR 0107(0002)]!

[~ 71]
[~ 72]
Which Pokémon’s nickname should I rate\nfor you?
Hmmm. [VAR 0102(0000)], is it?\c\nThat is quite a fine nickname.\c\nBut I think we could give it something even\nbetter. What do you think?
I see! What would you like the new nickname\nto be?
Done! From now on, this Pokémon shall be\nknown as [VAR 0102(0000)]!\c\nYou’re right—that does seem to fit it better.\nNicely done!
[~ 77]
Done! From now on, this Pokémon shall be\nknown as [VAR 0102(0000)]!\c\nIt looks no different from before, but we both\nknow this name is much better!\r\nHow fortunate for you!
Hmmm. [VAR 0102(0000)]!\nThat is a truly impeccable nickname!\r\nI can’t say anything bad about it!\c\nTake good care of [VAR 0102(0000)]!
Now, now...\nThat is merely an Egg.
Or do you want to quit giving the Pokémon a\nnickname and change back to the name that\r\nthe Pokémon had when you two met?
Yes, yes. [VAR 0101(0001)]!\c\nIt reminds you of the time when you first met\nthe Pokémon!\c\nCome see me again if you want to give\nPokémon nicknames.
For a Pokémon you got from another Trainer,\nyou only get one go at changing its name.\c\nIt’ll be [VAR 0102(0000)] from now on and forever.\nSo you’re sure that’s the name you want?
All right.\nLet me know if you change your mind.
Shall I rate another Pokémon’s name?
Which Pokémon’s memories are you interested in?
Somehow I can tell what Pokémon remember.
[VAR 0102(0000)] seems to have memories from\nits time with another Trainer.
Do you want to hear about the memories of any\nother Pokémon?
[VAR 0102(0000)] seems to have a fond memory,\nbut it doesn’t seem to be able to remember\r\nthe details...

Hey there, Trainer! You’ve just taken your first\nstep into the world of camping!\c\nPeople call me the Camping King!\nI can help you out with all your camping needs.\c\nRemember, everyone starts out as a rookie!\nIf you’ve got any questions about camping, feel\r\nfree to ask me!
Well, well! Today looks like another fine day\nfor camping, I’d say!
Is there anything camping related you’d like\nsome help with?
I want to change my tent color
Rate my Curry Dex, please
I want to change my cooking utensils
Feel free to ask me anything about camping!
I’ll pick out a color that goes well with\nyour Pokémon!
Hmm. Hmm. Yes, I see...\c\nA color that would suit [VAR 0102(0000)]...\nThat’s it! It must be the [VAR 0103(0001)] type’s color!
Oho. Let’s see now...\c\nA color that suits your [VAR 0102(0000)]...\nWhich do you think is a better fit?
Yes
No
[VAR 0103(0000)]-type color
[VAR 0103(0001)]-type color
The [VAR 0103(0000)]-type color? Are you sure?!
I’ve changed your tent to the\n[VAR 0103(0000)]-type color!
Oh? Why, you haven’t made a single dish yet!\c\nCome back after you’ve tried making one, and\nshow me!
You’ve reached the highest heights of curry\ncreation! I have nothing more to teach you!\c\nContinue to strive for curry creation excellence!
How’s your Curry Dex coming along? Allow me\nto have a quick look at it.\c\nLooks like you’ve made [VAR 0202(0001)] kind[VAR 1101(0001,0100)]s of curry!
You’re still a camping rookie!\c\nFor starters, why not try throwing any ingredients\nyou like in the pot and see what comes of it!
Looks like you’re getting the hang of cooking\nwhile out camping.\c\nTry adding in Berries to your curry to give it\na little extra oomph!
With ten curries under your belt, I think you’ve\ngraduated from rookie status!\c\nKeep trying to create all manner of wonderful\ncurries from here on out!
You’ve certainly started making your way down\nthe long road of curry cooking!\c\nBe sure to fan the flames just right, so as not to\nburn the dish. And don’t spill anything when\r\nstirring the pot!
Oh! Why, you’ve made at least thirty different\nkinds of curry!\c\nI can feel the curry creation potential radiating\nfrom you!\c\nKeep doing your best to aim for higher and\nhigher heights!
Seems like making curry has become a common\npart of your everyday life by now, right?\c\nRemember you can always buy more ingredients,\nas well as find them lying on the ground!\c\nGather as many different ingredients as you can\nand make all different kinds of curry!
You stand now among the curry cooking elite!\c\nYou probably already know this, but if you cook\nin someone else’s camp, there’s a chance you’ll\r\nbe able to use an ingredient that wasn’t in\r\nyour Bag!
That look on your face! That faint fragrance of\nsome spice!\c\nYou’ve become a truly splendid curry chef!\c\nI bet there are times you look through your\nCurry Dex and relive all the memories that\r\nfill it!
You’ve made every single curry I know of?!\nAmazing...simply amazing!\c\nYou may very well complete your Curry Dex\nbefore even I do!
Oh? Oh?! Could this be? Can this truly be?!\c\nYou’ve...you’ve completed your Curry Dex!\nYou’ve made every known curry in this world\r\nto date!\c\nTo have come so far in your camp cooking...\nI’m touched! Truly touched! Thank you!
Since you’ve made at least [VAR 0202(0000)] different\nkind[VAR 1101(0000,0100)]s of curry, how about a reward?
You put [VAR 1300(0001,0000)][VAR 010A(0001)]\naway in your Camping Gear.
You put the Fresh Ball away in your\nCamping Gear.
You put the Weighted Ball away in your\nCamping Gear.
You put the Soothe Ball away in your\nCamping Gear.
You put the Mirror Ball away in your\nCamping Gear.
You put the Tympole Ball away in your\nCamping Gear.
You put the Champion Ball away in your\nCamping Gear.
Sausages are a staple topping! Be sure to try\ncooking with them!
This Fresh Ball is a new kind of Poké Ball I’ve\ndeveloped... Nah, I’m just having a laugh!\c\nIt’s a toy you can use to play with your Pokémon\nwhile camping.\c\nIt’s the spitting image of a Watmel Berry, and it’s\nquite heavy, too. You might have a little difficulty\r\nthrowing it!
Remember, a Heavy Ball is what you use to\ncatch Pokémon!\c\nThis might look similar, but it’s a Weighted Ball...\nIt’s just a toy!\c\nIt makes a real heavy sound as it bounces! Try\nplaying with it when camping with your Pokémon!
The Soothe Ball makes a sound like a bell\nwhen you throw it!\c\nTry throwing it when you’re camping with your\nPokémon to calm everyone’s hearts!
The Mirror Ball is ultra-reflective and the\npinnacle of funkiness!\c\nTry throwing it when you’re camping with your\nPokémon to get everyone pumped up!
The Tympole Ball looks like...well...Tympole.\c\nYou can hear Tympole’s cute cry when the ball\nbounces on the ground!
The Champion Ball is a kind of gag gift with\nLeon’s face on it!\c\nTry throwing it when you’re camping with\nyour Pokémon. Leon’s face will fly far\r\nand bounce with some impressive oomph!
Moomoo Cheese melts in a curry and makes a\ndish taste even better!\c\nCooking with it will also help you add some new\nentries to your Curry Dex. So try using this\r\ningredient next time you cook!
Everyone knows Slowpoke Tails are a delicacy!\nThey fall off all the time and grow back quickly,\r\nso they’ve become a popular cooking ingredient!\c\nAdding it to a curry is sure to create a taste that\nyou’ll fall in love with!
Ah, another thing...
Thank you for completing your Curry Dex!\c\nYou’ve truly accomplished something marvelous!\nAnd such a cook deserves an appropriate set\r\nof cooking utensils. Please take these!
You received the golden cooking utensils!
You’re using the golden cooking utensils right\nnow. Would you like to change back to the\r\nnormal ones?
You’re using normal cooking utensils right now.\nWould you like to change to the golden ones?
You changed to the normal cooking utensils!

Fresh Ball
Weighted Ball
Soothe Ball
Mirror Ball
Tympole Ball
Champion Ball
No, thanks
All right, then we’ll leave your tent as its\ncurrent color!
All right! We’ll leave things as they are!
Hm? Your tent is already the\n[VAR 0103(0000)]-type color.
First, I’ll tell you about the mysterious dish\ncalled curry. Everyone in Galar has been hooked\r\non it!\c\nTo start, you need to mix in a Berry to make the\ncurry! Then you cover a grain called “rice” in it!\c\nAnd there you have it! It’s quite literally curry\nwith rice!\c\nBut wait!\c\nThere are ingredients that you can add to the\ndish, like toppings to better suit your tastes!\c\nYou can make all sorts of magnificent curries\nwhile you’re camping!\c\nAnd whenever you make a new kind of curry, it’ll\nbe automatically saved in your Curry Dex! So try\r\nmaking all manner of different curry recipes!
You got the Fresh Ball!
You got the Weighted Ball!
You got the Soothe Ball!
You got the Mirror Ball!
You got the Tympole Ball!
You got the Champion Ball!

A Gym Challenger!\c\nAh, but if you want to battle our Leader Kabu,\nyou’ll need to have earned a Grass Badge in\r\nTurffield and a Water Badge in Hulbury first!
A Gym Challenger!\nAnd you’ve even earned your first two Badges!\c\nBut I’m afraid our Leader Kabu has gone off to\nGalar Mine No. 2 to undergo some special\r\ntraining with his team.\c\nYou might want to head there to try to catch him.
Oh? A bit late for challenging the Gym tonight,\nwouldn’t you say? Come again tomorrow.\c\nIf you need a place to pass the night, all Gym\nChallengers can stay at the Budew Drop Inn.
Let’s all do our utmost as Gym Challengers.
First stop will be Turffield, eh?\nI’m off for Route 3 myself!
I’ve made it this far, at least...\nBut now I’m not sure I can make it any further.\r\nCan I really beat the Fire Gym? I don’t know...
Your Pokémon really got stuck in and did [VAR 1101(00FD,0503)]itstheir\nbest for you, didn’t [VAR 1101(00FD,0402)]itthey...\c\nWhen I watched your match, I was the one who\nended up feeling fired up to carry on!
The opening ceremony of the Gym Challenge...\nMy whole family’ll be watching back home...\c\nI should go check my hair once more in the\nmirror, don’t you think?
Getting to see Chairman Rose address us all\nlike that... I’ve never been so fired up in my life!
I got the Grass Badge and the Water Badge...\nBut can I really get a Fire Badge?
You beat that Kabu fellow?!\nYou really are a great Trainer...\c\nAt this rate, I bet the other Gym Challengers\nwill start wanting to test their mettle against you.
I heard that this year’s Gym Challengers include\nTrainers that were endorsed by the chairman and\r\neven the Champion!
Collecting all eight Gym Badges...\nIt feels a bit like a treasure hunt, doesn’t it?\c\nI wonder how hard the battles will be against\nthe Gym Leaders, though.
You’re one of those Gym Challengers that were\nendorsed by Leon, right?\c\nNo wonder you’re up to taking on Kabu.
That’s Leon for you, isn’t it...\c\nHe must’ve seen at a glance how much potential\nyou had, and that’s why he chose to endorse you.
I’m dead nervous, and this is only the opening\nceremony... What’s the matter with me?!\c\nMy Pokémon all seem to be aching to battle,\nso why can’t I seem to feel the same way...?
I got to stand on the pitch in a stadium, just like\nI’ve always dreamed of doing...\c\nNext up, I’ll be battling on that pitch! No!\nWinning on that pitch—as the crowd goes wild!
There are heaps of us starting out like this,\nbut only a small number will make it to the end...
Just seeing the Champion is a dream come true.\nBut my real dream ought to be to defeat him!
Finally, the time’s come for\nanother Gym Challenge!
Time to train up my\nteam out on Route 3!
I’m ready for that Fire\nGym Leader Kabu!
We’re not done yet.\nLet’s give it our all!
Everyone’s already nervous.\nWill we make it to the end?
I’m going to make it to the\nend of this—just you watch!
There are still a number of\nchallengers in the running!
That Gym Challenger’s done\nbetter than I ever dreamed!
Hmm. So everyone here is\na fellow Gym Challenger...
Everyone’s going to be\ncompeting to win this.

Some Pokémon aren’t affected by weather\nchanges, right?\c\nOr I guess I could have my Pokémon change the\nweather right back...
Raihan says that I can challenge him as many\ntimes as I want, but...\c\nTo be honest, I can’t imagine any way I could\ndefeat him...
Grass types do tend to be easily influenced by\nchanges in the weather...
Maybe an item that can extend weather effects...

Sorry, only authorized personnel are allowed to\ntake the lift down to the power plant.
It’s too dangerous right now to take the lift down\nto the power plant!
Dynamax Pokémon rampaging, Ms. Oleana losing\nher cool...\c\nEverything’s been turned on its head. Please,\nyou must help Mr. Rose!
You need to gather seven Gym Badges if you\nwant to face the Dragon-type user Raihan.
If you’re looking for Raihan, he headed over to\nthe tunnel to help subdue the wild Dynamax\r\nPokémon. The tunnel is past Route 7.

“Regarding the Changes Pokémon Can Undergo”\nPokémon do not only change in appearance\nwhen they level up. They can also do so through\nthe use of certain items or under the influence of\nthe area they are in, in some cases.\c\nIt is hypothesized that some factor within the\nPokémon itself is what allows for these changes\nto their form and biology, but thus far, conclusive\nevidence of such a factor has not been found\nby researchers.
“What Is the Dynamax Phenomenon?”\nThis phenomenon, in which Pokémon take on\ngigantic forms, has only been observed in the\nGalar region. Moreover, it only seems to occur\nin specific locations and under set conditions.
“On the Gigantification of Pokémon”\nWhile the general principal holds that Pokémon\ngrow stronger and larger by evolving, it is also\ntrue that simply making oneself appear larger\nis another survival strategy with merit.

Oh, don’t you look a treat!\nI knew that Bag would suit you.\c\nNow hurry along. Hop is waiting, isn’t he?\c\nBut remember—no going into the forest for\nthe two of you![VAR 0114(0008)]

Hahaha! Have a look at you, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nThat old Bag looks like it could pull you over!\c\nAt least we know that it should hold anything Lee\nmight bring, even if it’s as big as a Snorlax![VAR 0114(0005)]
A Wooloo...\nBut what’s it doing there?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hey! You silly Wooloo! I see what you’re up to!\nDon’t go using Tackle on the fencing![VAR 0114(0005)]
Now, you listen!\nNo going past that fence! No!\c\nEveryone knows there are scary Pokémon living\nin the Slumbering Weald![VAR 0114(0005)]
Meeeh?
Now that that’s taken care of...\c\nHow about it, [VAR 0100(0000)]? Let’s race!\nBet I can make it to my house first, what with you\r\nlugging about that big old Bag![VAR 0114(0005)]

Mum! Is he here?![VAR 0114(0005)]
There you are at last, Hop!
Oh, and you’ve brought along [VAR 0100(0000)].\nHello, dear.
Oh, and you’ve brought along [VAR 0100(0000)].\nHello, dear.
Yeah, yeah, but where’s Lee?\nHave you got him crammed in a cupboard?[VAR 0114(0005)]
He’s still not here yet! For the hundredth time...\nHonestly, Hop, you must learn some patience!
He’s probably only just arrived at the station\nin Wedgehurst.
Then that’s where I’m going!\nYou know Lee is hopeless with directions.\r\nI’ll make sure he doesn’t get lost on the way![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, will you?\nYes, that probably is for the best...
You’ve got to come with, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nYou’ve still never met my big bro, right?\c\nYou can’t miss out on your chance to meet the\nundefeated Champion![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll wait for you out on the route![VAR 0114(0005)]
Go on with Hop to pick up Leon, won’t you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]? I know you’re the reliable sort.
Go on with Hop to pick up Leon, won’t you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]? I know you’re the reliable sort.

Only remember, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nWild Pokémon could come out of nowhere if\nyou walk through patches of tall grass.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ve got my Wooloo with me, so I’m ready for\nbattles against wild Pokémon, of course.[VAR 0114(0005)]

It’s our unbeatable Champion!\nLeon, you and Charizard are the greatest!
Well, thank you for that!\c\nI hope you’ll all carry on training up your\nPokémon and never shy from battle.\c\nThen come challenge me for the Champion title![VAR 0114(0004)]
We’re on it! We’ve all been working on our battle\nskills just like you’ve taught us to, Lee!
But that Charizard of yours is too strong for\nthe likes of us to take on!
Too true that Charizard is blazingly strong.\nBut other Pokémon can be strong as well!\c\nThat’s why I want the strongest of challengers\nto fill the Gym Challenge and come battle me![VAR 0114(0004)]
My wish is for Galar’s Trainers to work together\nto become the strongest in all the world![VAR 0114(0004)]

Lee![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hop![VAR 0114(0004)]
So, my number-one fan in all the world has come\nout of his way to pick me up![VAR 0114(0004)]
Look at you, Hop!\c\nI reckon you’ve grown...exactly an inch and a\nquarter since the last time I saw you![VAR 0114(0004)]
Bingo! That’s the sort of sharp eye that’s kept\nyou undefeated so long, eh, Lee?[VAR 0114(0005)]
And these bright eyes over here...\c\nI’ve got it!\nYou must be [VAR 0100(0000)]—am I right?\r\nI’ve heard loads about you from my little brother.[VAR 0114(0004)]
I’m the Galar region’s greatest-ever Pokémon\nChampion—and a massive Charizard fan, too.\c\nPeople call me the unbeatable Leon![VAR 0114(0004)]
Come on, Lee! And you, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nBet I can beat the both of you back home![VAR 0114(0005)]
That Hop...\nAlways wanting to be the best, isn’t he?\c\nWith a proper rival of his own, I bet he’d push\nhimself to become something truly special...[VAR 0114(0004)]
Well, everyone! I bid you farewell for today!\nBut don’t you fret...\c\nI’ll always be around to make sure everyone in\nGalar can have a champion time![VAR 0114(0004)]

Scorbunny is Fire type.\nIt’s filled to bursting with fiery passion![VAR 0114(0004)]
That’s the Water-type Sobble.\nIt adapts to anything, as surely as water flows.[VAR 0114(0004)]
The Grass-type Pokémon Grookey, eh?\nIt’s soothing—like a nice, long walk in the woods.[VAR 0114(0004)]

The next day...
You spent the whole night with that new partner\nof yours, right, Hop?\c\nYou two getting on all right?\nUnderstanding one another?\r\nMaybe even built up a bit of love?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Course I have, Lee!\c\n[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]’s made fast friends with h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser\n[VAR 0101(0001)], too.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Then listen up, new Trainers!\nBelieve in yourself and your Pokémon!\c\nIf you trust in one another and carry on battling\nside by side long enough, then someday...[VAR 0114(0004)]
you might even become worthy rivals for me,\nthe unbeatable Champion![VAR 0114(0004)]
What’re you looking at h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer for, Lee?!\nI’m the one who’ll be coming to challenge you![VAR 0114(0005)]
If you think [VAR 0100(0000)] might be able to\nchallenge you, then I guess [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she’s my first rival!\c\nBut I’m not planning to lose to h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer and miss out\non my chance to beat the unbeatable Champion![VAR 0114(0005)]

Just having a Pokémon with you doesn’t make\nyou a real Trainer, you know.\c\nProper Trainers raise their Pokémon up to be\nfirst-rate in battle, too![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, and you think you’re worthy of calling\nyourself such a proper Trainer already, Hop?\c\nGuess I’ll be the judge of that!\c\nLet’s see how you handle yourself in a battle\nagainst your friend, if [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she’s up for it.[VAR 0114(0004)]
What do you say? Willing and ready to take Hop\non in the first-ever Pokémon battle of your life?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Then how about I give you a spot of advice.\c\nYou don’t want to go getting so caught up in\nthings that you forget everything you’ve\r\naccomplished till now.\c\nTake a moment to jot down what you’ve done,\nin order to save a record of your progress![VAR 0114(0004)]
Believe in your partner Pokémon!\nAnd care for them, too, with all your heart.\c\nDo those two things, and I’m certain you’ll learn\nto choose the moves that suit your Pokémon.\c\nAnd more importantly...to have a champion time\nbattling with them![VAR 0114(0004)]
Looks like everyone’s on board, Pokémon and\nTrainers alike? Then let’s do this![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’ve watched every match that Lee’s ever had!\c\nI’ve read every book and magazine he left\nbehind at home, too!\c\nI know exactly what to do in order to win![VAR 0114(0005)]
Well, that was a shock! Guess I know now why\nLee thought he should give you a Pokémon, too...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Sorry, mate.\c\nEven if you did get your Pokémon direct from\na champ like Lee, looks like I’m still the greatest![VAR 0114(0005)]
You and your Pokémon all fought hard.\c\nMade me almost want to let out Charizard and\njoin in on all the fun!\c\nGood effort out there, [VAR 0101(0001)]!\nWhy don’t I get you all sorted?[VAR 0114(0004)]
And, [VAR 0100(0000)], you’ve got real promise!\nIn fact, I’ve got a favor to ask you...\c\nBe a real rival to Hop, would you?\nPush him, and make the both of you stronger![VAR 0114(0004)]
Me and [VAR 0101(0002)] are ready to have a\ngo at you anytime![VAR 0114(0005)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_0120

I already want to get stronger and stronger!\c\nYou’ve seen me battle now, Lee, so come on—\nyou’ve gotta let me take on the [VAR FF00(0006)]Pokémon Gyms[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
You? Join the [VAR FF00(0006)]Gym Challenge[VAR FF00(0000)]?\c\nYou think you’re ready for the single greatest\ncompetition in the Galar region?\c\nNot putting the cart before the Rapidash there,\nLittle Brother?[VAR 0114(0004)]
If that’s really what you want to do, you two have\na whole lot you need to learn about Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Especially your friend [VAR 0100(0000)].\nBefore you think about getting Gym Badges,\r\nbest to think about getting a Pokédex.[VAR 0114(0004)]
A Trainer’s Pokédex helps them learn lots of\nthings about all the Pokémon out there, including\r\ntheir strengths.\c\nBut it’s more than just a collection of data, you\nknow. It’s a record of a Trainer’s love and passion\r\nfor Pokémon training![VAR 0114(0004)]
Right, right, we get it...\nPokédexes, then! We’re on it!\c\nLooks like it’s off to the Pokémon Research Lab\nfor you and me, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s the kind of enthusiasm a Trainer needs!\nI’ll let the professor know to expect you.[VAR 0114(0004)]
I’m going to be the next Champion, so\ncompleting a simple Pokédex will be nothing!\r\nJust another page in the tale of my legend![VAR 0114(0005)]
You’d probably better go tell your mum that\nwe’re heading out, though.[VAR 0114(0005)]
You’ve found yourself a perfectly lovely partner,\nhaven’t you? Congratulations, dear.

The gate’s open!\nAnd the Wooloo that was there...[VAR 0114(0005)]
It was tackling the fence pretty hard earlier.\nYou don’t think it actually broke through there,\r\ndo you?[VAR 0114(0005)]
But it’s off-limits!\nNobody’s supposed to go in there!\c\nI remember the professor’s granddaughter went\nin once, and she came back in a real state...\c\nAnd that was nothing compared to the earful\nshe got from the professor afterward![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]... What do you say?[VAR 0114(0005)]
We’ve got to save it!
I don’t know...
Right? Even if we’re not supposed to, this is the\nkind of scene where you simply have to do\r\nwhat’s needed![VAR 0114(0005)]
Right...\nNo one wants to get in trouble, least of all me.\c\nBut deep down you want to save that Pokémon,\ntoo, don’t you?[VAR 0114(0005)]

Hey! [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]!\nNot trying to ditch me in here, are you?[VAR 0114(0005)]

Oh, that’s nice to hear from the little brother\nwho had me worried sick!\c\nI’d been waiting ages for you two, and you\nnever showed!\c\nOf course I came looking for the both of you![VAR 0114(0004)]
Wait, where’s the Wooloo?!\nWe were trying to rescue that Wooloo![VAR 0114(0005)]
Meh!
The little chap’s just fine.\c\nThough all of you had fainted by the time I\nfound you here.\c\nYou know this place is out of bounds...\c\nBut it took courage to come in here all the same.\nAnd I can understand well enough why you did it.\c\nYou did good, Hop![VAR 0114(0004)]
And at least that Wooloo’s all right...\nYeah, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nI thought we’d had it when that weird fog started\nrolling in and that mad Pokémon attacked...\r\nbut at least it wasn’t all for nothing![VAR 0114(0005)]
Attacked by some mad Pokémon?\nWhat are you talking about, Hop?[VAR 0114(0004)]
It seemed loads stronger than any Pokémon I’ve\never seen. And it just had this sort of presence...\r\nOur moves didn’t even touch it. I mean, really—\r\nthey seemed to pass right through it![VAR 0114(0005)]
Your moves passed right through it?\c\nSo, the fearsome Pokémon they say live in the\nSlumbering Weald...\r\nAre they actually illusions or something?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Get strong enough and maybe the two of you\ncould be the ones to reveal the truth someday.[VAR 0114(0004)]
For now, let’s simply get out of this place.\nYou’ll be all right now that I’m here with you![VAR 0114(0004)]
Even if we did get an earful from Lee...[VAR 0114(0005)]

Good to see you, too, Yamper![VAR 0114(0004)]
Yamper here is a real champ when it comes to\nhelping you find your way around.\c\nHe came to my rescue plenty of times back in\nthe day, when I got lost on the road.\c\nOh yeah, and that’s his Trainer, Sonia.\c\nWhat can I say about Sonia?\nWell, I like the way she cooks.\r\nShe makes food you can gobble down in a flash.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Tsk. What kind of an introduction is that?\nDid you forget we were rivals during our\r\nGym Challenge?\c\nIt wasn’t just Yamper helping you out.\nI did, too.[VAR 0114(000B)]

Rotom Phones are handy little things, aren’t\nthey? They’ve got a map and a navigation tool.\c\nThat said, Leon still gets lost, so...[VAR 0114(000B)]

Don’t worry!\c\nHere, I’ll make it so that you can use the\n[VAR FF00(0001)]Pokédex[VAR FF00(0000)] on your Rotom Phone![VAR 0114(000B)]
You obtained the [VAR FF00(0008)]Pokédex[VAR FF00(0000)]!
Just so you know, that Pokédex is a gift\nfrom my gran![VAR 0114(000B)]
Could you let Gran know that you received\nthe Pokédex?\c\nShe lives in the house down along Route 2.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Leon’s a right amazing Champion, and I’m\nbasically just an assistant...\c\nI’m not even Gran’s official assistant, either. I’ve\njust been calling myself one...\r\nSomehow, it makes me feel a little restless.[VAR 0114(000B)]

Hey there, Trainer! Sorry to stop you.
You just left the Pokémon Lab, right?\nSo that means you’ve got a Pokédex, yeah?\c\nI love talking to new Trainers and giving them\nuseful stuff.
It’s a Potion. Use it when your Pokémon’s HP—\ntheir hit points—gets low. HP is like a Pokémon’s\r\nstamina. You can even use Potions during battle.
Knowledge is power! It’s a good idea to talk to\nlots of different people and read everything you\r\ncan on your journey!

Got your Pokédex from Sonia?\c\nThen it’s time to meet lots of different Pokémon\nand start building up a strong team![VAR 0114(0005)]
But battling strong Pokémon in the wild can leave\nyour team in a bad way. Not to mention what\r\nbattling another Trainer can do...\r\nLuckily, we’ve got Pokémon Centers![VAR 0114(0005)]
Luckier yet, they’re dead easy to spot.\nThey look the same wherever you go.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nBet you’ve never been inside one![VAR 0114(0005)]

Level with me, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nIs this your first time in a Pokémon Center?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Yes...
Of course not
Then I don’t think you need me to tell you what\nyou already know.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Then the future Champion’s got you covered![VAR 0114(0005)]
First things first—you talk to the lady at the\ncounter if you want your Pokémon healed up.[VAR 0114(0005)]
And Pokémon you catch are kept in computers\nlike the one you can find here, see?\c\nAfter all, you can only bring six Pokémon with\nyou on the road in your party.[VAR 0114(0005)]
The Potions they sell at the Poké Mart got me\nout of a real rough spot the other day!
If you two kids are Pokémon Trainers, you might\nwant to buy some Potions before you head out!
Cheers! I’m already good, though.\c\nI’m heading to Route 2, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nCome find me, maybe, when you’re done here![VAR 0114(0005)]

Listen, [VAR 0100(0000)]. I’ve been thinking...\c\nIf you’re a Pokémon Trainer now, you must want\nto try your hand at the [VAR FF00(0006)]Gym Challenge[VAR FF00(0000)], right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
The Gym Challenge?
What’s that?
The Gym Challenge, mate!\c\nThe annual competition where Trainers can battle\nit out for the right to challenge the Champion![VAR 0114(0005)]
But the trick is that you’ve got to be endorsed\nif you want to take part.\c\nAnd Lee doesn’t seem to think I’m up to snuff...\c\nSo I’m thinking I ought to talk to the professor\nand see if she could help![VAR 0114(0005)]
You’ve got to take part, too!\c\nA proper rival is just the thing every Trainer\nneeds to keep growing stronger, after all.\r\nKeeps you motivated, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
The professor’s house is way down at the end of\nRoute 2, so let’s head there...and give our teams\r\nthe chance to train up a bit along the way![VAR 0114(0005)]

All right, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nIt’s time we filled in our teams a bit—[VAR 0114(0005)]
And I’m here to teach you how!\c\nYou’ll need to catch Pokémon if you’ve got any\nhope of filling in that Pokédex.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Lee?! Where’d you come from?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Only...look at you, little [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nYou’ve already caught some on your own!\c\nYour mum gave you those Poké Balls, did she?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Every Pokémon has got a type or two, which can\nmake it good against some opponents but poor\r\nagainst others.\c\nThat’s the reason you’ll want to catch different\nPokémon—to cover one another’s weaknesses.\c\nNow, let’s all have a champion time as I show you\nhow it’s done![VAR 0114(0004)]
[~ 6]
[~ 7]

Typical Lee![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll give you some more Poké Balls. In return, I’ll\nonly ask that you catch plenty of Pokémon!\c\nThe Pokémon around here seem easy to catch.\nAlmost like they’re itching to join some Trainer’s\r\nteam, wouldn’t you say?[VAR 0114(0004)]
The Pokémon on your team will get Exp. Points\nwhen you catch Pokémon, too.[VAR 0114(0005)]
And of course, they get Exp. Points from battle,\nso take on the other Trainers you meet along the\r\npath to help your Pokémon thrive.\c\nYour team will keep on changing and growing\nas you get stronger together, no doubt...\r\nBut even I don’t know exactly how yet!\r\nShow your Champion something good, all right?[VAR 0114(0004)]
All right! I’m gonna catch loads of Pokémon.\nThe professor will be shocked when she sees![VAR 0114(0005)]

Oh goodness, no.\nThe whole thing is still full of questions.\c\nI’d hoped that my granddaughter would take\nover my research, but...[VAR 0114(0042)]
Dear me, I’m sorry.\nI didn’t even notice my guests![VAR 0114(0042)]

Why, Hop dear.\nI see Wooloo has made some new friends.[VAR 0114(000A)]
And you must be [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nI trust you received the Pokédex from Sonia.\nI’m sure you’ll have it complete in no time![VAR 0114(000A)]
You must already know about Dynamaxing,\nright, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Professor Magnolia’s been doing research into\nthe Dynamax phenomenon for years and years.\c\nAnd it takes a proper understanding of the thing\nif you plan to use Dynamaxing to the fullest![VAR 0114(0004)]
There you go again, Leon, always talking\nabout Pokémon.\c\nThere are other things that are worth knowing\nabout, too, you know.\r\nLike how many different types of tea there are![VAR 0114(000A)]
Hey, Professor, do us a favor, would you?\c\nHelp me convince Lee he should endorse us for\nthe Gym Challenge![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh Leon, why wouldn’t you endorse them?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Hop and [VAR 0100(0000)] only just started out\nas Pokémon Trainers...\r\nThere’s still loads they don’t know yet![VAR 0114(0004)]
Dearie, I thought your dream was to have\neveryone in the Galar region become strong\r\nTrainers. Isn’t that right?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Well, yeah...you’re not wrong.\c\nThat goal’s precisely the reason I gave them both\nPokémon, in fact.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Right, then.\nIn that case...how about this?\c\nLet’s see if the two of you can show me such a\nbrilliant battle that I’m left with no choice but\r\nto endorse you.\c\nAnd don’t worry. I’ll make sure both your teams\nare in good shape before the battle starts.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Right!\nI’ll be waiting outside, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Now remember, be sure to give it everything\nyou’ve got.\c\nThat’s the best thing you can do for your\nPokémon—and for yourself, too.[VAR 0114(000A)]

I’m going to become the greatest Pokémon\nTrainer there is!\c\nAnd to do that, I need that endorsement to\ntake part in the Gym Challenge![VAR 0114(0005)]
Come at me with everything you have so we can\nprove to Lee that we’ve got what it takes![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 2]
I’m rather interested in seeing how you two\nyoung Trainers battle, too.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Listen, you two. The reason I’m unbeatable is\nbecause I learn from every battle I see or take\r\npart in. That’s how I’ve gotten to where I am today.\c\nSo show me something good in this battle![VAR 0114(0004)]
We’ll be sure to.\nReady for this, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nTime for a serious match between you and me...\nto fill in another page in the tale of my legend![VAR 0114(0005)]
Of course!
I need to prepare...
It’s time for my legend to begin![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, fine... Guess I can wait a bit.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hurry it up, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nYou’ve gotta battle me so I can get myself\nthat endorsement![VAR 0114(0005)]
You remember what I asked you, don’t you?\c\nI think you’ve got potential, and that’s why I\nwant you to be a real rival to Hop.\r\nAnd that’s direct from your Champion Leon![VAR 0114(0004)]

Hah! See that! I knew I could do it.\nAm I ever glad I could beat you this time![VAR 0114(0005)]
Undefeated!\nAnd my Pokémon’s moves were seriously on point![VAR 0114(0005)]
The sting of defeat and the joy of victory...\c\nI guess going through both is the key to the\ntwo of us getting stronger, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]

Yes! Thanks, Lee! I swear I’m going to win my\nway through the Gym Challenge to reach you![VAR 0114(0005)]
You may both be young still, and plenty rough\naround the edges, but it was a proper battle.\c\nCharizard and I were both feeling the excitement\nin every last cell in our bodies![VAR 0114(0004)]
Hop, you’ve always tended to get caught up in\nthings like how you throw your Poké Ball out...\r\nThings that have nothing to do with real strength.\c\nHonestly, I’d been worried about you still\nobsessing over that sort of nonsense, but it\r\nseems you really have grown a bit, Little Brother![VAR 0114(0004)]
And I’d like to see some more thrilling Pokémon\nbattles out of you, too, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0004)]
All right, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nYou and me are going to train up against one\nanother to aim for that Champion’s title![VAR 0114(0005)]
Absolutely!
Against one another?
The more we keep battling against one another,\nthe more our Pokémon will grow.[VAR 0114(0005)]

With one of these, my Pokémon can Dynamax!\nThey’re gonna be massive! YES![VAR 0114(0005)]
Trust you to pull something like this!\c\nThey say Wishing Stars fall down for those who\nhave a true wish in their heart, you know.[VAR 0114(0004)]

Don’t be silly, Hop.\c\nThose Wishing Stars are composed of a curious\nsort of rock containing unknown power...\c\nThey are one of the most precious resources\nwe have here in the Galar region.\c\nBut they won’t do a thing for you in that state.\nGive them to me now, and I’ll have you sorted.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Ah, right. You’ve done heaps of research on the\nDynamax phenomenon, haven’t you, Professor?\c\nThen please! Give [VAR 0100(0000)] and me the\npower to Dynamax our Pokémon![VAR 0114(0005)]
First we got to battle against that mad Pokémon\nin the Slumbering Weald, and now this...\c\nIt really feels like we’re getting caught up in the\nadventure of a lifetime![VAR 0114(0005)]
I do understand your excitement, young man,\nbut don’t get carried away. You want to save\r\nyour energy for tomorrow’s journey![VAR 0114(000A)]
Seems I came back home right in time for all\nthe excitement![VAR 0114(000B)]

Er, well, there was weird heavy fog, and then this\neven weirder Pokémon appeared...\c\n[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)] tried to fight it off!\nBut then I think we both passed out or something.\r\nIt’s all pretty hazy.[VAR 0114(0005)]

[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], Hop, these are for you.[VAR 0114(000A)]
You got a Dynamax Band from Professor\nMagnolia and slipped it on your wrist!
Those are your Dynamax Bands.\c\nI made them by fitting the Wishing Stars you\nfound last night into those bands.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Thanks, Professor! This is brilliant!\c\nIt’s just like the one Lee has on him, too.\nNow we can Dynamax our Pokémon like he does![VAR 0114(0005)]
My word, you don’t waste any time, do you?\c\nI think you’ll find it’s not so simple as all that.\nThere are a number of conditions you must meet\r\nif you hope to have your Pokémon Dynamax and\r\ntake on that gigantic form.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Now, don’t be afraid to go to all sorts of places\nand meet all sorts of Pokémon.\c\nThat will help fill out your Pokédex, too.[VAR 0114(000A)]

One last thing before we race, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nSee, I’ve got some great advice for you![VAR 0114(0005)]
You know how you sometimes see Pokémon\nwandering about out of the tall grass, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
If you move real slow like, and crouch down,\nthose Pokémon won’t pay you any notice.[VAR 0114(0005)]
But on the other hand...\c\nIf you whistle at them, you’ll be SURE to catch\ntheir attention![VAR 0114(0005)]
If you’re a bit rubbish at whistling, just remember\nthis: “Need a fail-proof trick? Press the Left Stick!”[VAR 0114(0005)]
Try it out, and let’s see who can catch the most\nPokémon, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
You remember Wedgehurst Station, right?\nWhere we went to pick up Lee before.\r\nThat’ll be the goal, so see you there![VAR 0114(0005)]
Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nYou’ll never beat me to the station at that pace![VAR 0114(0005)]
So, out with it, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nHow many did you catch?\c\nI caught a really special one![VAR 0114(0005)]
And you got...\c\nNot one?! What were you doing this whole time?\nYou’re going to want a team if you’re a Trainer![VAR 0114(0005)]
And you got yourself...\c\nOoh, just one! Looks like we’re at a draw.\nThough we are rivals and all, so that’s fair![VAR 0114(0005)]
But look at how many you caught!\nYou’re well on your way to building a fine team.[VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s a technical machine! A TM, mate!\c\nWith a TM like that, you can teach your Pokémon\na new move in a flash.\r\nAnd you can use them again and again, too.\c\nThat one can teach the move Swift.\nLee gave it to me ages ago, and now it’s yours.[VAR 0114(0005)]

No matter what happens out there, if you and\nyour partner are together, I know you’ll be fine.[VAR 0114(0008)]

Of course you will be, darling.\nAnyway, do have fun and take care of yourselves!\r\nYou’ll be welcome back home anytime![VAR 0114(0009)]

Ouch, Professor...
Ah... Never you mind that!\nNothing to worry yourselves over!\c\nBesides, I’d been quite curious about that\nPokémon you two met in the forest.\c\nI’d been thinking I should look into it, so\nthe timing works out fine![VAR 0114(000B)]
If I discover something really huge, then maybe\neven Gran’ll admit I’ve got some talent![VAR 0114(000B)]

What cheek! Dynamax Pokémon are\nreally on another level, you know!\c\nYou’d better Dynamax your partner Pokémon,\ntoo, if you want to take on opponents that strong![VAR 0114(000B)]
You’ll find spots here and there in the Wild Area\nthat emit a red beam of light.\c\nIf you think you’re up to it, check them out.\nThere’ll be Dynamax Pokémon lurking inside!\c\nSo with that, how about I send you off with a\nlittle treat from me?[VAR 0114(000B)]
With a Pokémon Box Link, you’ll be able to\nput Pokémon from your team into your Boxes\r\nor take Pokémon from your Boxes to add them\r\nto your team. Nice, right?\c\nSo go wild catching as many Pokémon as you\nlike, and fill in some more of your Pokédex![VAR 0114(000B)]

Why don’t you try playing around with your\nLeague Card a bit, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\r\nHere’s a sample for you![VAR 0114(000B)]

But Motostoke sure is big, right? Not to worry!\nSonia is here to show you around a bit!\c\nCome find me after you heal up your Pokémon![VAR 0114(000B)]
The opening ceremony, huh...\c\nI get a bit worked up when I think how exciting\nand moving it was to actually stand on a\r\nstadium’s pitch for the first time![VAR 0114(000B)]

So, brilliant young Trainer who’s braved the\nWild Area! Do you remember what your goal in\r\nMotostoke is?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m here for the Gym Challenge!
Uhhh...
Yup! The Gym Challenge opening ceremony.[VAR 0114(000B)]
What? You seriously forgot about the Gym\nChallenge opening ceremony?[VAR 0114(000B)]
By the way, the ceremony tomorrow is being held\nat the Motostoke Stadium, OK?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Use that lift over there to get to the\nstadium, ’K?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Well, laters! I’m going to swing by the shops\nwhile I’m here, but don’t forget to register at the\r\nstadium, ’K?[VAR 0114(000B)]

I’d surely never make it to the stadium without\nyou to show me the way, partner.\c\nEven with a huge old thing like this bang in the\nmiddle of the city, I still get lost.[VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! All right?[VAR 0114(0004)]
One look tells me that you’ve become a Trainer\nworthy of that endorsement I gave you!\c\nAnd...yes, I reckon you might even be ready\nto use this...\c\nHere, try giving this to your partner to hold![VAR 0114(0004)]
You heading for Motostoke Stadium?[VAR 0114(0004)]
I am!
I’ve got other plans first
You can take that lift up to the city’s upper level,\nif you’re headed for the stadium next.[VAR 0114(0004)]
I guess you might want to have a look around\nthe city first. Only don’t get lost like I do!\c\nWhen you’re ready to visit the stadium, take\nthe lift to get up there![VAR 0114(0004)]

Everyone’ll be watching the opening ceremony\nfor the Gym Challenge...\c\nMy mum... Your mum... The whole world![VAR 0114(0005)]
It’s getting me a bit nervous, really...\c\nNaw, this isn’t nerves...\nI’m only trembling because I’m so excited![VAR 0114(0005)]

Let’s get signed up![VAR 0114(0005)]
If you’re here to register for the Gym Challenge,\nI’ll need to see your endorsement, please.
Fancy that... This is the first time we’ve had\na challenger endorsed by the Champion!
Well, now you’ve had two, because I am as well![VAR 0114(0005)]
What?! Two of you at once?!\nI wonder what’s come over Leon this year...\r\nThe two of you must be something special.
I’m Hop!\c\nI’m Leon’s little brother, in fact.\nAnd the next Champion.\c\nGet me all signed up, would you?[VAR 0114(0005)]
W-well, yes, I am trying to...\nIf you’ll just give me a moment...
There! You two have been successfully\nregistered as Gym Challengers.\c\nYou can now choose your preferred number\nfor your uniform, if you’d be so kind?\c\nIt will be displayed on the back of the uniform\nyou must wear for any official match.
Number [VAR 01C4(0001)], is it? Very well.\c\nAnd here. Please wear this Challenge Band at all\ntimes to identify yourself as a Gym Challenger.
The opening ceremony for the Gym Challenge\nis to be held here tomorrow.\c\nAll the Trainers taking part have been booked\na room at the nearby Budew Drop Inn.
That’s the League Chairman for you!\nEven booked us all hotel rooms!\c\nI’m off to check out the fancy digs![VAR 0114(0005)]
You’re lookin’ a bit gobsmacked by all this.\c\nYou must be from some small country town,\nis that it? I’m quite the same myself.[VAR 0114(0042)]
I was endorsed by the chairman himself.\c\nIn other words, among all those elite enough to\nget an endorsement, I’m the most elite of all.\c\nSo why don’t you clear off and not try talking to\nme again, would you?\c\nIt’s positively criminal of you, wasting the time\nof someone as important as I am.[VAR 0114(0042)]

If you’re looking for the Budew Drop Inn,\nyou’ll find it’s not far from the stadium.\c\nHead toward Route 3—it’s along the way.

Hiya! Looks like you both got\nyourselves registered.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh hey, Sonia! What’re you doing at our hotel?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m researching the mysterious Pokémon that\nare said to be in the Slumbering Weald.\c\nI reckon if I look into some of Galar’s legends, I\nmight figure something out. Care to join me?\r\nYou’re here already anyway.[VAR 0114(000B)]
What’s this, then?[VAR 0114(0005)]
It’s a statue of the hero who once saved the\nGalar region. I could run through the legend\r\nright quick, if you fancy?[VAR 0114(000B)]
The short version, if you please!
Give me all the details!
Long ago...a great black storm covered the\nGalar region. People called it “the Darkest Day.”\c\nThe land was assaulted by gigantic Pokémon...\nbut they were defeated by a single young hero\r\nbearing a sword and shield.\c\nThis statue here is meant to depict the young\nhero of that legend.[VAR 0114(000B)]
We still don’t understand what kind of sword and\nshield the hero actually had.\c\nAnd what this “black storm” is supposed to be\nis just another mystery...\c\nWhatever it was, it blotted out the skies all\nacross Galar. I suppose that tracks with it\r\nbeing called the Darkest Day, but still...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Huh... I suppose that hero must’ve been about as\nstrong as Lee, then!\c\nLooks like you’re going to have your hands full\nwith plenty to research, though, Sonia.\r\nBlack storms and swords and shields and all...[VAR 0114(0005)]
You’ll be all right, Sonia!
Will you be all right, Sonia?
Heh, thanks!\nI’ll muddle through somehow—don’t you worry![VAR 0114(000B)]
Course I will.\nI’ll muddle through somehow—don’t you worry![VAR 0114(000B)]
You two are staying here at the hotel tonight,\nthough, aren’t you? Shouldn’t you check in?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Probably so!\c\nAnd we’ll look out for you, too, Sonia. If we hear\nanything about any hero or whatnot, we’ll tell you![VAR 0114(0005)]
I guess we probably should head to the front\ndesk to get checked in.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Thanks for always taggin’ along with Hop.\nI hope you can keep it up.\c\nLeon really worries about him, too.\nHe practically raised him, after all.[VAR 0114(000B)]

They’re just so caught up with wantin’ to support\nme and all that they tend to get a bit shirty with\r\nother Gym Challengers.\c\nSorry if they caused you any trouble.[VAR 0114(000D)]

Wonderful!\c\nYou look sharp as a pin. And that [VAR 01C4(0001)] there...\nThat really is the number for you!

The chairman certainly seems to be in\nhigh spirits!\c\nNow, listen closely, you two. You’ve both only\njust started on your path as Trainers.\c\nIf you want to win, you need to do more than\njust train your Pokémon. You need to train\r\nyourselves, too.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Let’s do it, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nYou know the Gym Challenge has a set order that\r\nyou’ve gotta visit the Gyms in, right?\c\nThe first is in Turffield!\nAnd to get there, we need to head to Route 3![VAR 0114(0005)]

Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)], the chairman asked\nme to deliver this gift to you.
A gift...such a wonderful thing...\nFrom the chairman...such a wonderful man...
*ahem* Excuse me.\nThe gift is access to the Flying Taxis!
They allow you to, in a word, [VAR FF00(0001)]Fly[VAR FF00(0000)]!\c\nCalling a Flying Taxi will allow you to travel\nquickly back to areas you’ve already visited!
If it’s all right with you, I’ll read a segment from\nthe Flying Taxi user’s manual. *ahem*\c\n“Press the X Button and select the Town Map\noption to choose the place you’d like to go to.”
Anyway, your next goal should be Turffield—isn’t\nthat right, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nWhen traveling to a new place, it’s best to get\nthere on your own two legs, don’t you think?

All right!
But why?
I knew you’d be up for it!\c\nWe’ve got to stay keener than anyone else if\nwe want to steal the spotlight from our rivals![VAR 0114(0005)]
Seriously? This is the moment when you\nplay along and act pumped up for battle!\c\nIf you’ve gotta ask why we should bother training,\nyou’ll never make it through the Gym Challenge![VAR 0114(0005)]
Just what I’d expect from my rival!\c\nYou know what?\nI’ll even give you one of my League Cards!\r\nThat’s how good I think you did in that battle.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Our Gym Challenge starts right now—from here\nin Motostoke!\c\nAlthough the first Gym Leader we’ll have to\nchallenge is in a town way far off from here...\c\nStill, you’d better believe I’m going to keep on\nwinning my way to that Championship Match![VAR 0114(0005)]

He went on ahead
He went a different way
He can’t sit still at all, can he?\nGuess he really wants to catch up to his brother.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Well, you’re rivals, after all. I guess it makes\nsense you’d train on your own.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh, I know! Let me tell you about something a\nbit interesting.[VAR 0114(000B)]
You see that building over there?\nIt’s a company owned by Chairman Rose.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Just past Route 3, there’s a mine where they\ndig up ore. That building over there processes it\r\ninto energy.[VAR 0114(000B)]
In other words, the chairman is responsible for\nproviding the Galar region with its energy, too.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Can’t say I really get him, but the chairman\nseems like a pretty brilliant guy, right?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Here, a little something for having a chin-wag\nwith me! It’s an Escape Rope.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ll heal up your Pokémon, too![VAR 0114(000B)]

Coming this way?\nI’d advise against it.\c\nAny Trainer with a Wishing Star is in for a beating\nfrom me and my Pokémon![VAR 0114(0042)]
You.\c\nYou’re the Gym Challenger endorsed by\nthe Champion, aren’t you?[VAR 0114(0042)]
What a joke.\c\nYou are aware that the chairman is more\nimportant than the Champion, right?\c\nI was chosen by the chairman himself, so that\nmakes me more amazing than you![VAR 0114(0042)]
I suppose I should prove beyond doubt just how\npathetic you are and how strong I am.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Well, that was unexpected.\nI suppose you’re more able than I thought.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Naturally, I’ll remember your battle style and\nstrategies now.\c\nI’m sure to easily defeat you if and when\nwe face each other in an official match.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Now that we’ve established that, I won’t waste\nany more time on you.\c\nI’ve already gathered every Wishing Star in\nthis area.

Got it!
Gym missions?
So, would you like to attempt the Gym mission?
Let’s do it!

The [VAR FF00(0001)]Gym mission[VAR FF00(0000)] is a sort of test you need to\ngo through before facing the Gym Leader.\c\nEach Gym has a different mission for challengers.
If you would like to attempt the Gym mission,\nplease change into your uniform!
Then let the Gym mission begin!\nGive it your best shot!
You’re here for the Gym mission, right?\c\nOne of my favorite words is perseverance!

Now, let the Gym mission begin!
Did you need something?
What was the mission?
I want to withdraw
I’m good
Then on with you! And good luck!
Chase after the Wooloo, and gather them by\nthe blockade made of straw bales!\c\nIf you do, they’ll break through the blockade,\nand you’ll be able to carry on ahead.
If you withdraw, you’ll have to start over the next\ntime you give the mission a try. So, are you sure?
Then I look forward to your next attempt!
Congratulations on completing the Gym mission,\nChallenger [VAR 0100(0000)]!

You’ve cleared the first blockade!
You’ve cleared the second blockade!\nTwo more to go—you’re halfway there!
Would you look at that! Defeating the Trainers\nseems to have settled that Yamper down, too!
Brilliant! You’ve made it through three blockades!\nJust one last obstacle remains!

My Gym’s the first one people face, so we get a\nlot of challengers.\c\nThat’s why I try to keep the Gym mission\nchallenging, but...[VAR 0114(000E)]
that didn’t stop you from completing\nit, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\r\nProper job![VAR 0114(000E)]
Sure seems like you understand Pokémon\nreal well.\c\nThis is gonna be a doozy of a battle!\nI’ll have to [VAR FF00(0001)]Dynamax[VAR FF00(0000)] my Pokémon\r\nif I want to win![VAR 0114(000E)]
That must have been a fulfilling Pokémon\nbattle for you![VAR 0114(000E)]
As proof that you have defeated a Gym Leader\nfor the Gym Challenge, allow me to present you\r\nwith your very own Grass Badge![VAR 0114(000E)]
You can now catch Pokémon of up to Lv. 25!
You need to obtain all eight Gym Badges in\norder to complete the Gym Challenge.\c\nAnd the only way to gather the Badges is to\ndefeat every Gym Leader![VAR 0114(000E)]
Do you want to go back to the reception area?
Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]! My most sincere\ncongratulations on defeating Gym Leader Milo!\c\nPlease accept this TM to commemorate\nyour victory.
Here, you can have Milo’s uniform to go with it!\nIt’s a replica, of course.
The Grass Badge looks good on you!\nKeep at it, Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]!

Thanks, Yamper![VAR 0114(000B)]
Bow wow wow!
I had you come ’cause I wanted to hear what\nyou thought.[VAR 0114(000B)]
So, that geoglyph...\nWhat do you think of it?[VAR 0114(000B)]
The Darkest Day?
Dynamax?
Right perceptive of you.\c\nEspecially since the portion depicting the black\nstorm has mostly disappeared.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Seems likely...\nIt certainly looks like a gigantic Pokémon.\c\nI suppose people three thousand years ago\ncould’ve just imagined this, but it looks too\r\nsimilar to Dynamax. It can’t just be coincidence.[VAR 0114(000B)]
A long time ago...a great black storm covered\nthe Galar region. Giant Pokémon ran rampant...\c\nBut what was that black storm they called\n“the Darkest Day”?\r\nWhat connection does it have to Dynamax?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Guess I’m the lucky lady who’ll be looking\ninto that... Gran sure gives me a lot to do.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Thanks for your thoughts on the matter!\nAs thanks, I’ll give you a League Card.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Milo’s a Grass-type Gym Leader. Things will go\nwell for you if you use Fire-, Flying-, or\r\nBug-type moves.\c\nTake these, too! It’d be pretty bad if your\nPokémon weren’t in fighting form![VAR 0114(000B)]
Go on, then! Get yourself to Turffield Stadium\nand battle yourself silly![VAR 0114(000B)]

Take a look at this, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
The Grass Gym Badge!\nI got it in one try![VAR 0114(0005)]
I reckon I’m just about the greatest when it\ncomes to wrangling Wooloo...\r\nI’ve had plenty of practice at it, after all![VAR 0114(0005)]
But I’m sure you can win this one, too.\nAfter all, you are my rival![VAR 0114(0005)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_0616
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some advice for you, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nThe Gym Challenge has a set order you’ll need\r\nto follow.[VAR 0114(000E)]
So that means your next stop should be in\nHulbury to meet Nessa. Hulbury’s just beyond\r\nRoute 5.\c\nOr since you’ve got the Grass Badge, you could\nhead to the Wild Area.\c\nIt’s a bit tricky to catch Pokémon that are a\nhigher level than the Pokémon on your team, but\r\nthey make powerful allies if you succeed![VAR 0114(000E)]

Oi! Just hand over that bike already!\nWe need it to cross this long bridge![VAR 0114(006F)]
We’re gonna use that bike to chase around\nGym Challengers! It’ll be a scream![VAR 0114(006F)]
How barbaric!\c\nIt wouldn’t work anyway. You don’t even have a\nRotom with you!
Hey, young Gym Challenger!\nThey’re trying to steal my bike!\c\nPlease, if you could give them a good thrashing,\nI would be in your debt!
Oi, we’re not tryin’ to steal the bike!\nOnly borrow it!\c\nWe’re gonna use it to chase after\nGym Challengers and make ’em all tired!\c\nBut I’m thinkin’ you deserve a special shout-out.\nI’m gonna crush you in a battle![VAR 0114(006F)]
Gah...\nYou crushed my attempt to crush you.[VAR 0114(006F)]
Why you... I want that bike!\nDon’t get in my way![VAR 0114(006F)]
You’re too strong! If you stay in the Gym\nChallenge, you’re gonna cause problems for\r\nour lady!\c\nYou ’aven’t seen the last of us! We’re gonna\nmake sure you stay out of our lady’s way![VAR 0114(006F)]
My word, you’re quite the Trainer!\c\nAnd I see you have a Pokédex, too!\nThat means you have a Rotom with you!\c\nFantastic! I think I’ll give this bike to you, then.\nBetter you have it than Team Yell!
Now, you know that Rotom love motors\nvery, very much, right?\c\nEnough to jump right into machines that\nhave motors!\c\nSo, that got me thinking... If I attached a motor\nto a bicycle, then maybe I could get a Rotom to\r\npop into that as well!
Right...
I see
Come now—give it a shot!\c\nEnjoy cycling together with Rotom to the fullest.
Chop, chop, come on now!\c\nYou and Rotom ride that bicycle together!
I’ll read the manual.\c\n“Press the + Button or - Button to ride your bike\nwith Rotom. Let’s get cycling!”

I’m warning you, though...\c\nAny closer than that and we’re going to have to\nhave a battle—you and me![VAR 0114(0005)]
I warned you! We’re both Gym Challengers\nwho’ve earned ourselves a Grass Badge.\r\nThis is the perfect training![VAR 0114(0005)]
You’ve gotten strong, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nSeems I’ve got to train even harder from now on.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Right then! Here, I’ll even share one of these.\nThey’re pretty dear, you know.[VAR 0114(0005)]

OK. See you later, Chairman. ♪
No need to rush off!\nI can still do more autographs!\c\nI’ll even give you my Pokémon League Card![VAR 0114(0006)]
We need the support of our fans to keep doing\nwhat we’re doing.\c\nChasing them off like that...\nAren’t you being a bit too harsh, Oleana?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Fans are very important, of course.\nThat’s why you need to keep doing your work—\r\nfor their sake.[VAR 0114(0007)]
I promise to do everything in my power to\nassist you, too, Chairman![VAR 0114(000C)]
Oh, and you were...?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Bede, sir.[VAR 0114(000C)]
That’s right! Bede! I daresay I’m impressed how\nfar you’ve come since I gave you that Pokémon\r\nall those years ago.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Will you be the one to win the Gym Challenge?\nOr perhaps it will be one of the Trainers\r\nendorsed by the Champion.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I will prove your faith in me was well placed,\nChairman. I won’t lose to anyone!\c\nAnyway, I will be on my way now.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Ah, your name was...[VAR 0100(0000)], right?\nWe were just talking about you!\c\nI admit I’m curious about Leon’s reasons for\nendorsing you.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Ah! I just had a good idea, as I tend to do![VAR 0114(0006)]
You’re going to face Gym Leader Nessa\nsoon, yes?\c\nIf you get a Gym Badge from her, I’ll hold a\ncelebration. I’d like to get to know you a\r\nlittle better, after all![VAR 0114(0006)]
Chairman, we should really be going...[VAR 0114(0007)]
Please do your best, for the sake of\nGalar’s future![VAR 0114(0006)]
The chairman will be heading to this town’s\nseafood restaurant.\c\nWin the Gym Badge and join him there at once.\nDo not keep him waiting.[VAR 0114(0007)]

You must be a Gym Challenger, right?[VAR 0114(000F)]
How did you know?
That’s amazing!
You’re one of the ones endorsed by Leon, right?[VAR 0114(000F)]
You’ve become something of a hot topic among\nthe Gym Leaders.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Here you go, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0101)]rs. Famous. I already heard\nabout you, so you should learn about me, too.[VAR 0114(000F)]

Hey there, Gym Challenger! Shall we start the\nprocess to get you ready for the Gym mission?
Let’s do it!
Please wait
Understood! Please come back whenever\nyou’re ready.
That’s right! You’ll have to change into your\nuniform. The changing room is located\r\nover there.
All right, you’re in your uniform! Head on in to\nthe Gym mission! Ah, by the way, while you’re\r\non the Gym mission, you can’t use your\r\nPokémon Box Link.
Ah, well, you see...Leader Nessa is actually out\nby the lighthouse right now.\r\nWould you mind going to get her?\c\nThe lighthouse is toward the ocean, after you\nexit the stadium.
Ah, the Gym mission, right? Don’t give up! My\nfavorite saying is “the persistent raindrops will\r\ncarve through stone”!

The Hulbury Pokémon Gym’s mission is this!\c\nA challenging maze! And you must reach the\ngoal to clear the mission!
However, some paths in the maze are blocked\nby water. What should you do then?
Try pressing that red button over there, and\nI imagine you’ll figure it out, future champ.
Now, let the Gym mission begin!
Did you need something?
What was the mission?
I want to withdraw
I’m good
Press the buttons to change the flow of the\nfalling water, and try to reach the goal!
If you withdraw, you’ll have to start over the next\ntime you give the mission a try. So, are you sure?
Then I look forward to your next attempt!
Then on with you! And good luck!

Welcome, honored Gym Challenger![VAR 0114(000F)]
I think you already realize, but I’m Nessa.\nSorry to have made you look for me.[VAR 0114(000F)]
I don’t doubt my humble mission’s difficulty...\nYet you cleared it. Your mind as a\r\nPokémon Trainer must be quite refined.[VAR 0114(000F)]
No matter what kind of plan your refined mind may\nbe plotting, my partner and I will be sure to sink it.[VAR 0114(000F)]
How...? How can this be?![VAR 0114(000F)]
*sigh*\nNow that I’ve battled you, I think I understand.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Continue to seize victories in the Gym Challenge\nwith your Pokémon.\c\nYou have an incredible spirit that may even be\nstrong enough to challenge the Champion.[VAR 0114(000F)]
You and your Pokémon are indeed deserving of\nthis Gym Badge.[VAR 0114(000F)]
You can now catch Pokémon of up to Lv. 30!
You’ll want to challenge the Fire Gym Leader\nnext. As you and your Pokémon are now,\r\nhe’ll definitely want to battle you.[VAR 0114(000F)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! My sincere congratulations for\nyour victory over Gym Leader Nessa. Please take\r\nthis commemorative TM.
Take this, too. It’s a replica of Nessa’s uniform!
Now that you’ve won the Water Badge, I’ll be\nwatching to see just how far you and your\r\nPokémon can go!
You’ve defeated the Gym Leader, Nessa!\nMy sincerest congratulations!
Do you want to go back to the reception area?
You decided to return to the reception desk.

Do not keep the chairman waiting. Head to the\nseafood restaurant—the Captain’s Table.\c\nSo you will not forget the chairman’s face,\nI will give you one of his League Cards.[VAR 0114(0007)]

Oh, were you invited, too?[VAR 0114(000B)]
You two know each other? That’s great!\nCome now—please be seated.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Hulbury is a seafood town.\c\nNaturally, if one is going to eat here, the\nobvious choice is the local cuisine!\r\nEverything on the menu is delicious.[VAR 0114(0006)]
By the way, how is Professor Magnolia getting on?[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m quite indebted to her, you know.\c\nShe was the one who figured out how to unleash\nthe power of Wishing Stars and use that power\r\nto Dynamax Pokémon. We would never have\r\nbeen able to create Dynamax Bands without her.[VAR 0114(0006)]
*sigh*\c\nShe was saying that there’s still so much\nwe don’t know about Dynamaxing.\r\nIt’s causing her some worry.[VAR 0114(000B)]
She even made me take a Power Spot Detector\nwith me when I started traveling...[VAR 0114(000B)]
A Power Spot Detector! That’s the device that\nallowed me to discover the Power Spots...\c\nLocations that emit Galar particles and allow\nPokémon to Dynamax![VAR 0114(0006)]
I don’t like hearing that Professor Magnolia is so\nworried, though. If only there were something\r\nI could do...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Sonia, it may be good for you to visit the vault\nin Hammerlocke.\c\nI believe the key to unlocking the secrets of\nthe Dynamax phenomenon lies in the history\r\npreserved there.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Understood, Chairman. I will arrange a meeting\nwith Ms. Sonia.[VAR 0114(0007)]
However, I believe it is about time we get\ngoing, Chairman.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Hm? But I’ve hardly had a chance to speak\nwith [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nIt’s regrettable, but I suppose it can’t be helped.\nIf something needs to get done, there’s no time\r\nlike the present, after all!\c\nIn any case, I bid you all farewell![VAR 0114(0006)]
*sigh*\nDoes he think he’s doing me a favor?\c\nHe’s right that the vault would be a good place\nto look for info on the legends, but...[VAR 0114(000B)]
You got the Water Badge, yeah? Defeating\nNessa’s no small feat.\r\nHere’s a TM as a reward![VAR 0114(000B)]
Nessa’s a good friend. Perhaps I should drop in\non her.\c\nUntil next time, Gym Challenger![VAR 0114(000B)]

All right, mate! You’ve got both the Grass Badge\nand the Water Badge by now, right?\c\nIn that case, we’re both headed for Motostoke\nand the Fire Gym Leader, Kabu![VAR 0114(0005)]
How about I share with you a little tip about\nthat Leader Kabu?\c\nFrom what I heard, he’s holed up now in Galar\nMine No. 2, undergoing some special training![VAR 0114(0005)]
If he’s in there, then we can’t take him on in\nMotostoke even if we zip right over there—\r\nputting the brakes on our Gym Challenge.\c\nSo I say we head to Galar Mine No. 2 ourselves!\nLet’s go see what all the fuss is about![VAR 0114(0005)]

I’d feel sorry for my Pokémon if I made them\ntake part in a battle against low-level opponents.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m not in the mood to deal with weaklings\nright now.\c\nThen again, I suppose it’s a form of mercy to\ncrush weak opponents early on.[VAR 0114(000C)]
If you’re under the misguided impression that\nyou’re stronger than me, then surely you would\r\nbe up for a Pokémon battle.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Naturally!
Hold on a minute...
It’s utterly inconceivable that I, the challenger\nchosen by the chairman, will lose![VAR 0114(000C)]
Hmph!\nI’ve no time to deal with pathetic Trainers![VAR 0114(000C)]
Ah, pardon me. It seems I must take back\nmy words.\c\nYou’re not weak—you just lack talent.\nYour chances of completing the Gym Challenge\r\nare pretty slim, I must say. Here, I’ll give you this.\r\nSomething to show you at least tried.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Now, where shall I go next to collect\nWishing Stars?[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m just gonna keep my mouth shut...\c\nOtherwise, his Pokémon will just knock me down\nagain... Nah, not doin’ that...[VAR 0114(0043)]

Yeah?\nAnd can’t you see that I’m Hop, the Trainer\r\nwho’ll be your next Champion?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oooh, so we’ve got a joker here, eh?\nYou’re so funny, I forgot to laugh.[VAR 0114(0044)]
You think I’m joking? I’ll prove it, then!\c\nAnd I think a battle with you lot would definitely\nend with some laughs![VAR 0114(0005)]
Let’s take ’em on together, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nYou ready, mate?[VAR 0114(0005)]
The two of us were endorsed by the\nChampion himself!\c\nWe’ll show you just what that means![VAR 0114(0005)]
Got it!\nThen get yourself all ready for a good battle![VAR 0114(0005)]
Well, if you insist... Team Yell’s gonna teach you\nkids that the Gym Challenge’s no joke!\r\nYou better not be yell-ow![VAR 0114(0043)]
What’d this other kid have to come waltzin’ up\nfor, eh? I just wanted to knock off challengers\r\none at a time...[VAR 0114(0044)]
Nice one, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nThat’s my rival for you![VAR 0114(0005)]
Now then...\nWhere could Kabu have gone off to?\r\nLet’s keep going. Maybe he’s farther in![VAR 0114(0005)]
That little mug’s the Champion’s little brother...\c\nGuess that’s what you get when your older\nbrother’s not useless...[VAR 0114(0043)]

Oi, can’t you see me spendin’ some quality time\nhere with my beloved Carkol?\c\nYou’re not tryin’ to disturb us, are you? If you are,\nI’ll just have to make it clear you’re not welcome![VAR 0114(0043)]
I was the strongest one in Galar Mine No. 2, but\nnow my spot’s been taken...[VAR 0114(0043)]
What’s your problem, eh?\c\nHere we had the brilliant idea to block the path\nwhile passin’ the time showin’ Carkol a\r\nbit of love, and then you come along![VAR 0114(0044)]
Retreat! That’s it, lads!\nLeave the Pokémon behind and leg it![VAR 0114(005E)]
Cleared them right off, eh, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Wait, have I got this straight?\c\nThose fanatics were only in our way...so they\ncould spend a bit of time playing with Carkol?![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hmph.\c\nIt seems I made the right decision, letting the\nrabble deal with the rabble.\c\nThe only thing weak Trainers like yourselves are\ngood for is clearing my path.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m sorry you had to deal with that, Carkol.\nWere you in the middle of a Poké Job, then?\c\nGo on! Break those rocks, and hurry back safe to\nyour Trainer![VAR 0114(000C)]
Goooooor!
Actually...\c\nYou two aren’t even all that useful in clearing\nmy path, compared to that Pokémon.\c\nStill, I suppose you did take care of Team Yell.\nHere’s something for your trouble.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Rrrgh! That little—![VAR 0114(0005)]
Do you suppose that Carkol found its way\nback to its Trainer all right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Still, I wonder...\nWhere has Kabu wandered off to?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Thank you for helping out with my training,\nTeam Yell! But I must say...\c\nit’s unforgivable for you to get in the way of a\nCarkol hard at work![VAR 0114(0010)]
We weren’t gettin’ in its way!\nWe were tryin’ to cheer it on![VAR 0114(0043)]
Still, you did a number on us in that Pokémon\nbattle, so...it’s time for Team Yell to scarper\r\nand give a morale boost elsewhere![VAR 0114(0044)]
Goooooor!
Cheering is one thing, but one shouldn’t get in\nthe way of honest work![VAR 0114(0010)]
That’s Kabu... Man, he’s wicked!\nNo wonder he’s the Fire-type Gym Leader![VAR 0114(0005)]
Ah, you are the Trainers endorsed by Leon!\nHop and [VAR 0100(0000)], am I right?\c\nI’m just training right up until the last moment so\nthat I can guarantee the perfect match when I\r\nface you Gym Challengers![VAR 0114(0010)]
I specialize in Fire-type Pokémon, and the\nWater-type Pokémon in Galar Mine No. 2 are\r\nthe perfect opponents to train against![VAR 0114(0010)]
Regardless, it’s getting late.\c\nJust go straight once you get out of this mine,\nand you’ll reach Motostoke.\c\nGet a good rest at the hotel, and make sure\nyou’re both in your top condition![VAR 0114(0010)]
Come on, Carkol. Time for you to head on home,\ntoo. I’ll make sure you get there safely.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Gooor!
We’re going to be on fire tomorrow![VAR 0114(0010)]
I remember Lee talking about Kabu.\c\nHe said that a lot of Gym Challengers give up\nbecause they just can’t beat Kabu.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Man, now I’m getting all fired up, too![VAR 0114(0005)]

That Carkol from before...\c\nI guess it must’ve been here on a job.\nYou do know about Poké Jobs by now, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I do
Poké what?
Course you do![VAR 0114(0005)]
Looks like there’s no helping it, in that case...\c\nSettle down and let Professor Hop teach you a\nthing or two!\c\nLet’s see if I can remember what Lee had written\ndown in his old notebooks...\c\nBasically, you can have your Pokémon go about\nand help companies or other folks who are in\r\nneed of something.\c\nYou can take Poké Jobs from the Rotomi at any\nPokémon Center, so give it a look sometime.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Now, I’m cream-crackered!\nI’m for the Budew Drop Inn and some sleep.\c\nCome tomorrow, that Fire Gym Leader Kabu\nbetter be ready, because I’ll be coming for him![VAR 0114(0005)]
Burning the midnight oil, are we?\c\nIf you’re here for the Gym Challenge, you won’t\nbe able to challenge Kabu till the morning.
For now, it’d be best to simply get yourself a\ngood night’s rest at the Budew Drop Inn!

Just ’cause you were chosen by the Champion,\ndoesn’t mean I’m gonna lose to you!\c\nIn fact, I’ll keep winnin’, and I’ll have a proper\ngo at the Champion, got it?[VAR 0114(000D)]

That friend of yours already went off to\nchallenge the next Gym.\c\nKabu’s League Card is supposed to help\nagainst him, but I ended up with a few copies,\r\nso I’ll give you one.\c\nDon’t look so chuffed. It’s no big deal.[VAR 0114(000D)]

A Gym Challenger!\c\nAh, but if you want to battle our Leader Kabu,\nyou’ll need to have earned a Grass Badge in\r\nTurffield and a Water Badge in Hulbury first!
A Gym Challenger!\nAnd you’ve even earned your first two Badges!\c\nBut I’m afraid our Leader Kabu has gone off to\nGalar Mine No. 2 to undergo some special\r\ntraining with his team.\c\nYou might want to head to Hulbury and try to\ncatch him in the mines on the way back here.
Hey, a Gym Challenger!\nThat’s a welcome sight!\c\nWe don’t have too many challengers, since our\nLeader Kabu has made his Gym mission so hard...\r\nBut I’ll be happy to get you registered at once!
I’m ready!
Not yet
Roger that! I’ll be here, so come back when\nyou’re ready to challenge our Gym!
If you’re here to challenge our Gym, we’ll ask\nyou to change into your uniform first...
Congratulations on clearing the Gym mission!\nYou had that one in the bag, eh?\c\nNext up will be your match against Leader Kabu.\nI wonder which one of you will burn brighter?
You may find the Fire Gym’s mission a bit\ndifferent than others you’ve faced. In you go!
Please take this TM to commemorate what\nyou accomplished here today!
And take one of our uniforms.\nIt’s the same design as Kabu himself wears.
Few enough people challenge Leader Kabu,\nand even fewer manage to defeat him...\c\nIt’ll be a treat to see how such a promising\nTrainer does in the Gym Challenge!
Back for our Gym mission, are you?\nGood luck racking up those points!
[~ 13]
Heya, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nI was on fire in my battle against that Kabu![VAR 0114(0005)]

The Gym mission for the Fire Gym is this!\c\nCatching Pokémon to earn the most points!
Earn five points to clear the Gym mission!\c\nIn case you were wondering, you’ll earn one\npoint for defeating a Pokémon in the tall grass\r\nor two points for catching a Pokémon.\c\nBut you won’t be alone in this competition.\nOther Trainers will be joining you in your battles!
Think about what your opponents might do,\nand try to take the best action to rack up points!
Now, let the Gym mission begin!
Did you need something?
What was the mission?
I want to withdraw
I’m good
Get five points to clear the mission!\c\nDefeating a Pokémon in the tall grass gets you\none point, but catching a Pokémon gets you two!
If you withdraw, you’ll have to start over the next\ntime you give the mission a try. So, are you sure?
Then I look forward to your next attempt!
Well done!\nThat’s the way to clear a Gym mission!
Next you’ll be facing Kabu, the leader of the\nFire Gym! On you go, Challenger!
Right you are!\nThen on you go, Challenger!
A cautious one, are you?\nGet yourself all sorted first, in that case.
Then on with you! And good luck!
Gym mission start!
Gym mission completed!
Clearing Leader Kabu’s Gym mission like that...\nYou’re positively on fire!
Congratulations on another mission cleared!
[~ 20]
Now [VAR 0200(0001)] more point[VAR 1101(0001,0100)]s needed to clear the\nFire Gym mission!\nKeep that fire burning! (Gym Leader Kabu)

[~ 32]
Oh my word, is Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]\nreally going to end this thing with naught?![VAR 0114(0018)]
Your target is the wild Pokémon!\nDon’t concern yourself with the other Trainers!
The other Gym Trainers are all stronger than me!\nBe careful out there!
Status conditions are the greatest!\nGetting burned will land you in real hot water!
A Full Heal can cure any sort of status condition!
Study the situation, and choose your opponent\nwisely based on it!
We won’t let you get through the Fire Gym’s\nmission that easily!

Welcome! I am Kabu, the Fire-type Gym Leader.\c\nThe fact that you are here means you’ve bested\nboth Milo’s Grass-type Pokémon and Nessa’s\r\nWater types, too.\c\nThat’s quite an accomplishment![VAR 0114(0010)]
Every Trainer and Pokémon trains hard in pursuit\nof victory.\c\nBut that means your opponent is also working\nhard to win.\c\nIn the end, the match is decided by which side is\nable to unleash their true potential.[VAR 0114(0010)]
I’m often regarded as the first real roadblock\nof the Gym Challenge, and yet you defeated me!\c\nClearly, your talent surpassed my many years\nof experience.\c\nI still have much to learn![VAR 0114(0010)]
I know now that you and your Pokémon will\nbecome a fantastic team.\r\nI’m glad I could battle you today![VAR 0114(0010)]
Let me give you a Fire Badge as proof that\nyou’ve defeated me![VAR 0114(0010)]
You can now catch Pokémon of up to Lv. 35!
Thanks to the Dynamax phenomenon, our\nPokémon battles have become part of the\r\nGalar region’s culture.[VAR 0114(0010)]
And it’s the young Trainers who are responsible\nfor keeping our culture alive.\c\nOf course, I hope that instead of just keeping it\nalive, you also help it become something better.\r\nWe adults will be the pillars for you to build on.[VAR 0114(0010)]

Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nI see you’ve done a fine job collecting the Gym\nBadges from the Grass, Water, and Fire Gyms.
I think you’ve proven your skill well enough to\ntry your hand against the Gyms that await you,\r\nstarting in the city of Hammerlocke.
Head back down into the Wild Area surrounding\nthis city, then make your way to Hammerlocke!
With all the Badges we’ve earned ourselves,\nI reckon we should be all right even against the\r\nfierce Pokémon you find deep in the Wild Area.\c\nLet’s go find out for ourselves![VAR 0114(0005)]

You’re the Gym Leader, but you still came all the\nway to see us off?\c\nOh, I bet you can already tell that I’m the one\nwho’ll become the next Champion, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
There are many Trainers who never manage\nto gather three Gym Badges, and they just\r\ngive up on the Gym Challenge altogether...\c\nSo I make a point to see off any Trainers who\nare able to defeat me.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Whew, we made it...\nThank goodness for Flying Taxis![VAR 0114(000F)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], Hop, congratulations!\nIt’s pretty amazing you two defeated Kabu![VAR 0114(000F)]
Not a lot of Gym Challengers are able to get a\nGym Badge from Kabu.\c\nWe like to get together to see them off, as a way\nof showing our support.[VAR 0114(000E)]
So, allow me to send you off with a\nproper, sporty chant![VAR 0114(0010)]
Hustle, hustle, hustle, Hop!\nYou can do it, you can do it, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0010)]
The Gym Leaders you will face ahead are all\ntough opponents.\c\nBut I believe that you will prevail!\nBelieve in your Pokémon and keep pushing on![VAR 0114(0010)]
Thanks, you all!\c\nWe’re gonna keep winning! We’ve got to if we\nwant a face-off in the Champion Cup, after all![VAR 0114(0005)]
Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nLet’s head for Hammerlocke![VAR 0114(0005)]
Look into yourself for things you lack.\c\nThose who understand their own weaknesses\nlearn and grow the most![VAR 0114(0010)]
You run into a lot of unexpected things\nwhen you work as a farmer.\c\nSame thing with Pokémon battles. Just don’t\ngive up and things will work out.[VAR 0114(000E)]
There’s nothing wrong with stoically facing\nchallenges, but push yourselves too hard, and\r\nyou’ll pop.\c\nIf you ever feel maxed out, come up for a\nbreather at the seafood restaurant.[VAR 0114(000F)]

I mean, it seems Hop here can’t even throw a\nPoké Ball properly.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Rubbish. More like you don’t know enough to\nrecognize greatness when you see it.\c\nMy throws are the greatest, and my bro is the\nfinest Champion the world has ever seen!\r\nI’m not gonna listen to you insulting him![VAR 0114(0005)]
How tiresome...\nFine. I’ll battle you over there.\c\nMaybe that will help you finally understand\njust how weak you are.[VAR 0114(000C)]

All this prattle about [VAR 0100(0000)] and the\nChampion and whatnot...\c\nDo you not have anything of your own to show?[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’ll show this wally my real skills in battle!\c\nSo, see you later, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nLet’s meet up in Hammerlocke when I’m through\r\nwith him![VAR 0114(0005)]

Oh, it’s you...\nI doubt Hop will be coming.[VAR 0114(000C)]
It’s only natural.\c\nAfter such a humiliating defeat, there’s no\nway he could look the Champion in the eye.\r\nI’m sure he’ll withdraw from the challenge.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Here, just look at the Gym Badges I’ve\nalready won.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Thank you, Challenger Bede.\nI can confirm you have the required Badges!
Anyway, I have a meeting with the chairman, so\nI must excuse myself.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Hmm? You don’t have the Fire Badge yet.\c\nYou can’t enter without the Fire Badge.\nWould you like me to take you back to the\r\nbridge at the Motostoke Riverbank?
Of course. In that case...

Mr. Chairman!\c\nI’ve been collecting both Wishing Stars and\nGym Badges as fast as I can![VAR 0114(000C)]
Good work, Bede.\c\nI’m glad you haven’t forgotten that it was the\nchairman who endorsed you.[VAR 0114(0007)]
If I gather enough Wishing Stars, that’ll help\nsolve the problem that’s been bothering you,\r\nright, Mr. Chairman?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Oh, it’s not just about me.\nIt’s for the future of the whole Galar region.[VAR 0114(0006)]
And we’ll need more than just Wishing Stars.\nWe need a powerful Pokémon Trainer, too—\r\nsomeone like the Champion.[VAR 0114(0006)]
With all due respect, sir, I was able to show\nHop, one of the Champion-endorsed Trainers,\r\njust how outclassed he was.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m sure I’ll be able to defeat the Champion.\nNo, I WILL defeat the Champion![VAR 0114(000C)]
That’s the spirit! It takes healthy competition\nto really keep the Gym Challenge energized![VAR 0114(0006)]
Challenger Bede, there is something I wish\nto discuss with you.\r\nDo you have a moment?[VAR 0114(0007)]
I hope you were listening, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0006)]
As you know, Wishing Stars are those mysterious\nstones that are even attached to your\r\nDynamax Bands.[VAR 0114(0006)]
There’s more to Wishing Stars than just making\nyour Pokémon into giants, though!\c\nThey hold far more energy than that![VAR 0114(0006)]
If you’re curious, you should head to the stadium.\nIn fact, we should head inside right away!\r\nI’ll even give you a little lesson on how the Galar\r\nregion gets its energy![VAR 0114(0006)]

Hammerlocke’s stadium doubles as an\nEnergy Plant.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Now, have a look at my tablet.\nI’ve got all the information you need on it.[VAR 0114(0006)]
See? An easy-to-understand description of\nthe Energy Plant!
First, energy is absorbed from Hammerlocke\nStadium’s tower...
Then, it’s changed into electricity in the\nunderground power plant and delivered to\r\npeople throughout the region!
Our lives and society require various types of\nenergy sources, such as electricity, natural gas,\r\nand water.[VAR 0114(0006)]
My associate groups aim to improve everyone’s\nlives by harnessing the power stored in\r\nWishing Stars![VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh! It’s time for me to get to work.\nI should get a move on before Oleana decides to\r\ngive me another earful.[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], I suggest you head over to the\nvault next.\c\nJust head toward Route 6 from the stadium, and\nyou should find the vault without any issues![VAR 0114(0006)]

But Hop...\c\nDid something happen with him?\nHe was acting really odd when I ran into him.\c\nHe took one look at me and immediately was\nlike, “I’m so sorry, Lee!”\c\nIt might be the first time I’ve heard him apologize\nfor anything, and I’ve no idea what it was for![VAR 0114(0004)]
Maybe he’s feeling down because he’s had some\nhard losses in battle?[VAR 0114(0004)]
He lost to that Challenger Bede
I think so
When you lose, you feel down in the dumps.\c\nBut then there’s nowhere left to go but back up!\nYou’ve got to think on why it was you lost, though.\c\nYou know, that little brother of mine...I think he\nmight yet become a surprisingly great Trainer![VAR 0114(0004)]
At least I’ve got you to keep an eye on him.\nYou will look out for Hop, won’t you? As his rival.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Blast, and look at the time!\c\nNearly forgot my meeting with the chairman.\nThat Oleana really lets me hear it when I’m late!\c\nNow if only I could remember which way to go...[VAR 0114(0004)]
Anyway, I’d say that you should go and say hello\nto Raihan while you’re here, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nHe’s the greatest rival I’ve got and the final\nhurdle you’ll have to face in the Gym Challenge.\c\nHe should still be around the vault, if you hurry.\nIt’s down that way—on the way to Route 6.[VAR 0114(0004)]

And if Leon himself recognized your potential...\nthen I guess you’ll grow into quite the Trainer.\c\nAll the same, though, anyone wanting to\nchallenge the mighty Raihan has to prove they’re\r\nup to it by earning seven Gym Badges first.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I already knew that
I’m here to visit the vault
Ah, so you’re here to see our treasures,\nare you?\c\nGaining a better understanding of Pokémon by\nstudying history certainly isn’t a bad idea.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I like your spirit, kid!\nFollow me, why don’t you.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I’ll even spare you one of my League Cards.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Now on you go!\nIf it’s the vault you want, it’s up those stairs there.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Weren’t you here to see the vault?\nThat girl’s up there, too. You know.\r\nMiss Clever Clogs.[VAR 0114(0017)]
If you want your chance to battle the great\nRaihan for yourself, collect those Gym Badges!\c\nYou’ll need seven of them—and the next is\nwaiting for you in Stow-on-Side, down Route 6.[VAR 0114(0017)]

The youths looking on at the sword and shield\nthat stop the disaster.[VAR 0114(000B)]
The youths being crowned.[VAR 0114(000B)]
These tapestries tell the story of the\ncreation of a kingdom in Galar.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Say, young Gym Challenger, what sticks out to\nyou most about them?[VAR 0114(000B)]
There’s two heroes?
The Darkest Day?
Bang on! The statue at that hotel in\nMotostoke only had one hero, no matter how\r\nyou slice it. But here, we clearly have two youths.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Right? That’s got to be it.\c\nThe story of the black storm that blotted out the\nskies was passed on through the years as a tale\r\nof disaster... That’s what the Darkest Day is![VAR 0114(000B)]
Was there really only one hero, or were there\ntwo? And what even caused the Darkest Day?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Thanks for letting me bounce some ideas off you.\nI think I’ve got some theories now.\c\nI’m going to research the tapestries a tad more,\nbut you have your Gym Challenge, right?\c\nI’m cheering for you, so take a couple of these.\nI hope to see more of your wins![VAR 0114(000B)]

The tapestries in the vault depict the heroes of\nthe Galar region’s past.\c\nI suppose if we’ve got any modern hero, it’d have\nto be our Champion, Leon.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Listen up, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nYour goal is to defeat that superstar Leon.\nSo go conquer Route 6 and train yourself up\r\nalong the way to Stow-on-Side![VAR 0114(0017)]

What a cute Silicobra.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Just look at those adorable eyes.[VAR 0114(0044)]
It’s our duty as Team Yell to make sure Silicobra\ngets a nice, peaceful sleep![VAR 0114(0043)]
Hello there. If I promise not to wake the\nPokémon, will you let me through?
Of course! It’d be our pleasure.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Oh, hey, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nYou’re heading to Stow-on-Side, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oi, Team Yell. Don’t suppose\nyou’ll let us through?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Nah, you kids are way too loud.\nCan’t be lettin’ you through.\c\nAn’ we’re particularly not fond of kids wearin’\nthe Challenge Band![VAR 0114(0043)]

I’ll battle them!
Let me think...
You...\nYeah, that’s the spirit![VAR 0114(0005)]
I don’t figure thinking at them is going to change\nmuch about the situation. What else you got?[VAR 0114(0005)]
You two are way too noisy. You don’t wanna\nwake up Silicobra, now do you?[VAR 0114(0044)]
I swear, kids these days... Well, we’ve got no\nchoice. We have to send you packin’.\r\nIt’s all for the sake of Silicobra![VAR 0114(0043)]

See, Bede really wiped the floor with me the\nlast time we battled...\c\nAnd don’t get me wrong—I can take a loss!\nBattling means you’ve got to lose sometimes.[VAR 0114(0005)]
But he said that I was dragging Lee’s good name\nthrough the mud, being so rubbish like I was...\c\nAnd I just can’t get those words out of my head![VAR 0114(0005)]
If I’m weak, then people’ll think Lee’s weak, too...\c\nBut I don’t want that! I can’t let Lee get dragged\ndown! He’s the unbeatable Champion!\c\nI’m gonna have to take some time figuring this\nout. See you around, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0005)]

Challenger Bede![VAR 0114(0007)]
I wondered what you were up to when you asked\nto borrow Chairman Rose’s Copperajah...\c\nI can’t believe you’d try to use the chairman’s\nPokémon to destroy a historical site![VAR 0114(0007)]
Who cares for some ancient ruin when the next\nthousand years are at stake?!\c\nDid you stand in the path of a Pokémon’s\nSimple Beam or something? How do you expect\r\nto support the chairman with that sort\r\nof thinking?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Young Bede...[VAR 0114(0006)]
It pains me to have to say this, but...\nI am truly disappointed.\c\nIt’s true that I am the one who found you,\nback when you were all alone...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I saw talent in you. You reminded me a little bit\nof myself, back when I was young.\c\nThat’s why I sent you to a Trainers’ school, to\ngive you a chance at success.[VAR 0114(0006)]
But trying to destroy the mural—part of Galar’s\nhistory! You show no love toward Galar!\c\nYou are clearly not a worthy challenger for the\nGym Challenge.[VAR 0114(0006)]
We will decide what to do with you later.\nFor now, you will return to Hammerlocke.[VAR 0114(0006)]
You...you must be joking, right?\c\nYou’re disqualifying me from the Gym Challenge?\nBut you’re the one who endorsed me!\c\nThere are a hundred different ways we could\nsort this out... Why are you choosing the worst\r\npossible option?![VAR 0114(000C)]

Ah, Sonia! And [VAR 0100(0000)], too.\nTerrible shame, all this. An absolute disaster.\c\nI never wish to see us lose challengers for this\nsort of reason.\c\nYet we do what we must do to keep things\nfair and sportsmanlike.[VAR 0114(0006)]

Not a brilliant turn of events, but the ruins were\nbrought into the light for us to see...[VAR 0114(000B)]
What does this tell us about Galar’s legends?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Pokémon?
A sword and shield?
Right! More than any hero, there’s those things\nthat appear to be Pokémon that stand out!\c\nNot just that, but those Pokémon appear to be\nholding a sword and shield as if they were\r\nusing them![VAR 0114(000B)]
Anything else look interesting to you?[VAR 0114(000B)]
The hero...was actually two people?
The same as the tapestries?
Oh, good observation!\c\nThere really were two heroes. But if that’s the\ncase, then why only the one statue at the\r\nBudew Drop Inn?[VAR 0114(000B)]
More than any statue of a hero or old tapestry,\nthese ruins made in truly ancient times must show\r\nus the real truth.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Which means...[VAR 0114(000B)]
The sword is a Pokémon!
The shield is a Pokémon!
Yup! I was thinking the same thing!\c\nSeems like at some point in history the sword and\nshield were combined with the two actual\r\nPokémon and treated as the same thing...\c\nBut then what? They just faded from history?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Two young heroes... The sword and shield were\nactually Pokémon... But why would the truth of\r\nthese ruins be hidden when their stories were\r\ndepicted in artwork?[VAR 0114(000B)]
With your help, I really feel like we made a big\ndiscovery here. Thanks! I’ll give you a couple of\r\nthese, so you keep giving it your best in the\r\nGym Challenge, too, OK?\c\nGuess you’ll be headed to Ballonlea next, right?[VAR 0114(000B)]

Right! Then head on in!\nGive my regards to the Gym Leader!
Of course. You probably need to save a record\nof your progress and whatnot.
All right, OK. It’s time to start your audition to\nsee if you’re worthy of becoming the Fairy-type\r\nGym Leader.
I see...\c\nI can’t say what Ms. Opal will think, but you’ve\nat least piqued my interest.

Don’t worry about right or wrong. Just keep\nmoving forward.

Hold on now.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I’ve got a few errands to run in Hammerlocke.\nCare to join me for the journey?\c\nIf you’re headed for the next Gym Stadium,\nyou’ll need to get to Hammerlocke, too, after all.[VAR 0114(0013)]
With pleasure!
I’ll find my own way
They say two’s company, after all.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I like that attitude, child.\c\nStill, you’re in the middle of the Gym Challenge,\nare you not?\c\nYou’ll need to head back to Hammerlocke either\nway if you want to get to Circhester.[VAR 0114(0013)]

Hammerlocke—always such a dusty town.\c\nThough I suppose some Pokémon prefer it\nthat way.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Didn’t we just part ways?\nI certainly seem to run into you a lot.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Hm? That boy...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Now that’s what I would call pink![VAR 0114(0013)]
Come to gawk at me now that I’ve had my\nChallenge Band taken away and my Gym\r\nChallenger status revoked?\c\nCan you really afford to waste time like this?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Of course!
Not really...
Well, I suppose so.\nYou no longer have to worry about catching up\r\nwith me, after all.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I commend your humility. It is appropriate for a\nTrainer of your...limited talents.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’ll have you know, though, that I haven’t given up!\c\nI must become the Champion in order to help\nout the chairman! I will go and ask him to let me\r\nrejoin the Gym Challenge![VAR 0114(000C)]
So sincere and straightforward and yet so\ntwisted and misguided...\c\nI like it! That’s the kind of thing that gives people\nsome depth![VAR 0114(0013)]
Now, listen. I’ll let you attempt my Gym mission,\neven if you’re not a Gym Challenger.\c\nIn fact, I don’t plan on giving you a choice, so\ndon’t even think about refusing.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Time for my Gym mission, child![VAR 0114(0013)]
Huh? Wha—?![VAR 0114(000C)]
Pink![VAR 0114(0013)]
Pink![VAR 0114(0013)]
And pink![VAR 0114(0013)]
Congratulations, child![VAR 0114(0013)]
You are most definitely pink.[VAR 0114(0013)]
M-Ms. Opal?\nWhat in the world has gotten into you?![VAR 0114(000C)]
You were used by Oleana—am I right?\nYou worked hard to gather Wishing Stars for her,\r\nonly to have her throw you away like rubbish\r\nonce she was done with you...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Come with me, child.\nI might be able to help you out.\c\nOf course, it all depends on how much hard work\nyou’re willing to put in, too.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Are you... Are you testing me?\c\nVery well, I accept! In fact, I plan on making\nsure you see my full talents and tell me\r\neverything you know about the Wishing Stars![VAR 0114(000C)]
Farewell for now, child.\nYou should head to Circhester.\r\nI take it you know how to get to Route 7.[VAR 0114(0013)]

Heya! The Badge collecting going well?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ve been doing some research on the ruins in\nStow-on-Side...[VAR 0114(000B)]
The sword and shield...\c\nWhat kind of Pokémon were they? And where\nare they now?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I still have so many questions, I was thinking\nabout taking another look at the tapestries in—[VAR 0114(000B)]
*Ka-BOOM*
Are you kidding me?![VAR 0114(000B)]

That’s where Chairman Rose’s power plant is,\nisn’t it?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Huh? A Power Spot?![VAR 0114(000B)]
What’s wrong?
You mean, like where you can Dynamax?
I’m getting readings from the Power Spot\nDetector... Does that mean Dynamaxing\r\nis possible here?[VAR 0114(000B)]
That’s right! The Power Spot Detector reacts\nwhen it’s possible to Dynamax![VAR 0114(000B)]
Hey, Sonia! And [VAR 0100(0000)], too!\nYou felt the shaking, right?\c\nSeems Chairman Rose is testing something again.[VAR 0114(0004)]

You’ll just get lost, Leon. I’m going, too![VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m really looking forward to seeing you compete\nin the Finals.\c\nSo you should leave the investigation on the\nquaking to the adults.\r\nHead to Circhester and get that Gym Badge![VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh! [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
First that forest, then that mad quiz...\nI’ve been lost in every sense of the word!\c\nBut it looks like I’ve finally caught up to\nyou again.[VAR 0114(0005)]

You and I both know I’ve got to keep on trying\ndifferent strategies if I’m gonna get strong\r\nenough to catch up to Lee...\c\nNo! Not just catch up! If I want to surpass him![VAR 0114(0005)]
So I think you know what’s coming, mate...\nLet me try out my latest in a battle against you![VAR 0114(0005)]
Before we ever started out on this journey...\nI remember watching Lee on the telly.\c\nHe was like a bright star, so strong I could hardly\nbear to look right at him.[VAR 0114(0005)]
But now, I can tell just how strong he really is...\nAnd what he’s got that I haven’t...[VAR 0114(0005)]
But I’m getting stronger, too.\nMaybe not as fast as you, but fine. Whatever!\c\nThanks for letting me battle with you again.\nAnd here. I’ll heal up your team for you, too![VAR 0114(0005)]
I think I know what it is I really want...\nI want to battle Lee—I want to take on my bro.\c\nBut not just that, I want to beat him!\c\nI want to be the one who beats the\nunbeatable Champion! And I’m going to![VAR 0114(0005)]
My mind’s made up!\c\nYou and me are going to have another battle\nonce I get my Gym Badge in Circhester![VAR 0114(0005)]

Welcome, Gym Challenger.\nDo you want to attempt the Gym mission?
Of course!
Let me think
If you want to attempt the mission, then you’ll\nneed to change into your uniform.\r\nThe dressing room’s that way.
Make sure to receive the Trap Detector up\nahead, too. You’ll need it for the Gym mission.
There may be some things you can’t overcome\nwithout pushing yourself at least a little.
You’re here for the Gym mission, right?\c\nOne of my favorite sayings is “determination will\nmove mountains”!
You look smashing in that uniform!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_1241

Would you like to hear the details of the Gym\nmission carried out here in Circhester?
I would!
I’m good...
Then allow me to explain a little about the Trap\nDetector you hold in your hands!
The reason you’ll need it is simple.\nThere are invisible pitfalls everywhere in here!
If you fall into one, you’ll have to start again\nfrom the last platform you reached.\c\nThe detector will vibrate when there’s a pitfall\nin front of you. The closer the hole, the stronger\r\nthe vibration!
Then on with you! And good luck!
Did you need something?
What was the mission?
I want to withdraw
I’m good
Try to reach the goal without falling into any\nof the invisible pitfalls!
If you withdraw, you’ll have to start over the next\ntime you give the mission a try. So, are you sure?
Then I look forward to your next attempt!
Enjoying the Gym mission?
Congratulations on completing the Gym mission!\c\nSo what do you say, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nWould you like to face the Gym Leader at once?
I would!
I’d rather not...
Very well! Move on ahead, and show that Gym\nLeader what you can do!
Of course. You no doubt have to prepare and\nsave a record of what you’ve done. I understand!
Gym mission start!
Gym mission cleared!
Oooh, that’s a right shame!\nAnd Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)] goes down!

Hey there. The name’s Gordie.[VAR 0114(0014)]
So you managed to reach me without falling\ninto any of the holes...\c\nOf course, you’d stand no chance against me if\nyou let a few holes get in your way.[VAR 0114(0014)]
I admit I feel a little bad for doing this to a\nGym Challenger, but...\c\nI’m going to use this match to show the crowd\nthat my Pokémon are unbeatable![VAR 0114(0014)]
So, let’s get this over with, Challenger![VAR 0114(0014)]
That was...impressive.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Rules are rules. Here, take this Rock Badge.[VAR 0114(0014)]
You can now catch Pokémon of up to Lv. 50!
Oh, don’t worry about me.\nI just need to train harder, that’s all.[VAR 0114(0014)]
As celebration of your victory over Gordie, take\nthis TM!
And here’s a special uniform!\nIt’s the same design that Gordie wears, and that\r\nmeans it’s extra cool!
The Rock Badge looks good on you!\nYou’re doing great, Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]!

I am Melony. As you can clearly see, I’ve\nassembled a team of all Ice-type Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Well, fancy that!\c\nYou made it all the way to me without falling in a\nhole. If I’m not careful, you could sweep my feet\r\nright out from under me.[VAR 0114(0015)]
You! You aren’t sore all over from falling in a\nhole or two, are you? Even if you are, I’m not\r\ngoing to hold back![VAR 0114(0015)]
All righty, I suppose we should get started. You\nwon’t be able to escape when I freeze you solid.\c\nAnd after that... Well, you’ll see. I think you’ll\nfind my battle style is quite severe.[VAR 0114(0015)]
You... You’re pretty good, huh? Of course seeing\nmy Pokémon lose is sad, but to meet someone so\r\nyoung with such ability is quite grand.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Here, take this sparkling Ice Badge![VAR 0114(0015)]
You can now catch Pokémon of up to Lv. 50!
For some reason, I can’t help but imagine my son\nchallenging you after you become the Champion.\c\nIf that time comes...give him a right thrashing,\nwould you?[VAR 0114(0015)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! My sincere congratulations for\nyour victory over Gym Leader Melony.\r\nPlease take this commemorative TM.

Got that Gym Badge, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nNice one![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, hey! There you are.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ve been trying to find out more about the\nDarkest Day and the sword and shield Pokémon,\r\nbut still no luck...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Wait! Hold on![VAR 0114(000B)]
No way! What’s this?![VAR 0114(000B)]
A new chapter in the old Galar legends?
A fifth tapestry!
An absolutely fantastic poster!
Exactly! Bob, with his brilliant smile, must be part\nof the legend![VAR 0114(000B)]
Wait, what are you on about?! Don’t confuse me![VAR 0114(000B)]
The heroes look sad... And where are the sword\nand shield?\c\nWhat was the meaning of this picture?[VAR 0114(000B)]
An end to the legend?
Some kind of seal?
Hmm... Perhaps when their duty was completed,\nthey went into some kind of sleep?[VAR 0114(000B)]
You think so? I guess it could be that they were\nsealed away. Or maybe they’ve gone into some\r\nkind of sleep?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Based on those statues we saw back in\nStow-on-Side, the sword and the shield were\r\nactually two Pokémon, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s right! That’s my take on it, at least.[VAR 0114(000B)]
You remember the Pokémon we met that day?\c\nDo you think...it could’ve been one of them?\nEither the sword or the shield Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0005)]
You...met them?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Come on! You know what I’m talking about,\nright, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
In the Slumbering Weald?
I really don’t
Exactly!\c\nThe mad Pokémon we ran into in the fog!\nDon’t you think that could’ve been it?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Not so sharp when it’s not about battle, huh?\c\nDon’t you remember that mad Pokémon we ran\ninto in the fog that day?\c\nDon’t you think that could’ve been it?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, that’s right! You lot have been in the\nSlumbering Weald.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I only started on this journey because my gran told\nme to, but this is turning out to be too much fun!\r\nYou’ve got to tell me more.\c\nHow about we discuss this over a meal? Go on,\nwhat do you want to eat? Let’s get our orders in![VAR 0114(000B)]
Fascinating...\c\nAll right, the next thing to do now that we’re\ndone eating is to have a look around Circhester!\r\nLet’s inspect the Hero’s Bath![VAR 0114(000B)]

Text File : main_event_1280

The Hero’s Bath...\c\nThey say this is where the two heroes came\nto soothe their wounds after the battle to bring\r\ndown that evil presence, long ago.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Nowadays only Pokémon really use the\nHero’s Bath, though...\c\nHmm... Who exactly were the heroes that\nbathed here?\c\nI think I’ll have to look into that.[VAR 0114(000B)]
You two met a mysterious Pokémon back in\nthe Slumbering Weald...\c\nPerhaps...you two can become new heroes.[VAR 0114(000B)]
What, like some hero waving around a sword and\nshield? Pull the other one.\c\nThough...I guess I’d fancy a shield, if I had to\ntake my pick.[VAR 0114(0005)]
What, like some hero waving around a sword and\nshield? Pull the other one.\c\nThough...I guess I’d fancy a sword, if I had to\ntake my pick.[VAR 0114(0005)]
What kind of battle do you think the heroes had\nback then?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Why don’t we show her, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nThink we can pull off a real heroic battle?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Absolutely!

Sonia treated us to a great meal. After that\ncurry, I feel like I’ve got the energy to wrestle\r\na Bewear![VAR 0114(0005)]
I don’t entirely understand your reasoning, but I\nmight just as well see what you can do.\r\nI’ll heal up your Pokémon for you, [VAR 0100(0000)],\r\nso give it your best![VAR 0114(000B)]
Time for a little exhibition match, starring the\nfuture Champion![VAR 0114(0005)]
Thanks! You two gave a right proper battle...\nAt the rate you both are going, even the\r\nunbeatable Leon may be in trouble![VAR 0114(000B)]
So what’s next, you two? I plan to look into\nthings in the Slumbering Weald.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m going to keep challenging that Gym!\c\nThen, once I get that Gym Badge, I’ll be heading\nfor Route 9 to take on Spikemuth next.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Seems like he finally shook off that gloom.\nLeon’d worry if Hop wasn’t feeling all right.\c\nAs his rival, you wouldn’t like it either, right?\nSee ya.[VAR 0114(000B)]

Why, we meet again, my young Gym\nChallenger friend!\c\nRemember me? I gave you that bike!\nSo, do you think you could do me another favor\r\nand teach these ruffians a lesson or two?
It’s our duty to protect Drednaw!\c\nAnd that means yer gonna need to give up on\nthe Gym Challenge!\c\nYou look like you need convincin’, so how\nabout a Pokémon battle?![VAR 0114(0043)]

Gah! [VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe’s gonna ride the Drednaw![VAR 0114(0043)]
Oi! I’ve got an idea! We can get on Drednaw\nfirst and ride it away![VAR 0114(0044)]
All right! Get a move on, Drednaw!\nSee ya later, Gym Challenger![VAR 0114(0043)]
Ba bite!
Seems you’ve come to my aid yet again.\c\nHow’s the cycling life been treating you?\nAre you having fun?
Wouldn’t it be great if you could ride your\nRotom Bike on the water, too?
That’s why I’m going to add these special parts,\nallowing it to travel along the water’s\r\nsurface...just for you!
All right, all right! With the Rotom Bike\n“Water Mode,” you’ll cruise across the water\r\nlike a Pokémon with Swift Swim!\c\nBy the by, when you’re riding on land, we’ll call it\n“Land Mode.”

If you’re lookin’ for the Gym Leader, he’s straight\nahead from here![VAR 0114(0045)]
If you head back, you’ll be retirin’. Do you\nwanna retire?[VAR 0114(0045)]
Step past there, and you’ll be givin’ up![VAR 0114(0045)]
Only one healthy Pokémon? You thinkin’ about\nturnin’ tail and yelleavin’?[VAR 0114(0045)]
You seriously beat Piers? Here—a\nTM to remember this moment![VAR 0114(0045)]
Hey! There’s some trouble over on Route 9!\nIt’s so bad, even the Champion’s come to sort\r\nthings out!\c\nOh, hey! You gave Piers a thrashing, didn’t you?\nYou should head over there to help. C’mon, then!\r\nI’ll show you the way.
Me? I’m just here as a part-time job. I’m fi-yellin’\nin for the proper League staff.[VAR 0114(0045)]
The Gym Leader’s waitin’ for you!\nGo right on ahead if you want to get trounced![VAR 0114(0045)]
[~ 12]

Gym Challenger.\c\nYou wanna get past me, but I don’t want that.\nBasically, it’s a battle between our desires.[VAR 0114(0045)]
I don’t wanna let you through! That’s why I was\nwaitin’ all squeezed in this crack.\c\nBut since I lost, it was really all for nothin’!\nWhatever. You won, so I guess I’ll step aside.[VAR 0114(0045)]
D’you know the Pokémon move Light Screen?[VAR 0114(0045)]
What’s this? A Gym Challenger made it through?\nAll us Team Yell members have blocked the way.\r\nDon’t think we’ll just let you waltz through![VAR 0114(0045)]
That was...totally unbelievable. Even my\nPokémon are in awe of you and your team.\c\nHere, go on through. Check out our neon signs\nwhile you’re at it.[VAR 0114(0045)]
Mr. Mime is a dancin’ Pokémon... It makes for a\ncheery member of our team.[VAR 0114(0045)]
I’m yellin’ for no reason![VAR 0114(0045)]
Did I surprise you? I’m a little surprised how\nmuch my legs hurt from that landin’!\c\nIf I stand still like this for too long, it’ll hurt\nso bad I might cry...\c\nSo I’ll shake it off with a battle![VAR 0114(0045)]
Well, it’s true that I lost, but I pushed through\nthe pain, so you should praise me for that!\c\nAll right! Now that the pain’s gone, I guess I’d\nbetter get outta here.[VAR 0114(0045)]
The HP of your Pokémon not lookin’ so good?[VAR 0114(0045)]
I practiced that back handspring so much, even a\npop star would be jealous of those moves.\r\nWere you surprised? Oi, be surprised, you!\c\nWhile you’re in utter shock, I’m gonna sneakily\nwin this battle![VAR 0114(0045)]
I shoulda been practicin’ my battle skills, not\nmy backflip skills...\c\nThanks for showin’ me that. Guess I’ll cheer for\nyou from now on.[VAR 0114(0045)]
Team Yell takes the field! This might be the\nGym Challenge, but I won’t let you ruin our\r\ncool secret hangout![VAR 0114(0045)]
What?! You only got one healthy Pokémon?\c\nOi, don’t come back unless you got a Revive\nor somethin’—got it?[VAR 0114(0045)]
All right, time for a pincer attack! We’ll do\nwhatever it takes to win![VAR 0114(0045)]
Ah! I didn’t have enough time to get my\ndisguise ready!\c\nThat’s right! Team Yell is actually made up\nof Spikemuth Gym Trainers!
Ugh, whatever! Our Gym Leader’s up next, but\nhe’s really strong. Got that?[VAR 0114(0045)]
I mean, everybody already knew the true identity\nof Team Yell, right?\c\nThat means I won’t get in trouble for not gettin’\nmy disguise on, right? I sure hope so...
Bari bari!
There’s some kind of invisible wall!\nYou can’t get through, no matter how you try!

Oh, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000D)]
Uh... I’m really sorry!\c\nThe lot from Spikemuth’s tellin’ me they\nlocked down the city for my sake...[VAR 0114(000D)]
Spikemuth just keeps gettin’ worse and worse.\nAnd all Piers says is “Don’t worry”...[VAR 0114(0043)]
So... So we decided to disguise ourselves as\nTeam Yell and sabotage the other challengers.[VAR 0114(0044)]
We thought, if we could stop the other\nGym Challengers from reachin’ the Gym, then\r\nMs. Marnie would be the only one to win and\r\nmake it to the Champion Cup![VAR 0114(0043)]
And we figured that’d increase the chances of\nour wonderful Ms. Marnie becomin’ the\r\nnew Champion![VAR 0114(0044)]
*sigh*\nThat’s no way to help someone at all![VAR 0114(000D)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], no need to bother with all the\npreparations, or whatever.\c\nGo on in and face the Gym Leader![VAR 0114(000D)]
Oh man, Ms. Marnie’s scoldings go on forever...\c\nI remember once she scolded her Morpeko\nfor so long, it practically fell asleep...[VAR 0114(0043)]
I can hear Piers just rockin’ away. His Pokémon\nchorus sounds pretty great, too.[VAR 0114(0044)]

*sigh*...\nSo you’re finally here, huh?[VAR 0114(0042)]
See, I’m...I’m really not a great Gym Leader.\c\nFigured that’s why nobody was comin’ to\nchallenge me.[VAR 0114(0042)]
I have good ears, so I overheard the whole thing\nabout the city bein’ shut up.\c\nWhen I was alone, it was like my soul\nwas weepin’.[VAR 0114(0042)]
This is a simple Gym Stadium. We can’t even\nDynamax our Pokémon, but well...\c\nI still hope you enjoy the battle.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Now then...[VAR 0114(0042)]
I’m the Gym Leader of Spikemuth,\nPiers, the Dark-type user![VAR 0114(0016)]
You wanna challenge me, even though you\nknow you’ll lose?\c\nThen this song’s for you, foolish Trainer![VAR 0114(0016)]
Get ready for a mosh pit with me and my party!\nSpikemuth, it’s time to rock![VAR 0114(0016)]
I’m glad we were able to battle. Seems like my\nPokémon feel the same way.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Here’s your Dark Badge.[VAR 0114(0016)]
You can now catch Pokémon of up to Lv. 55!
Here’s a uniform, too...\c\nI’ve actually been thinkin’ about just sellin’\nthem at my concerts.[VAR 0114(0016)]
My little sis Marnie’s gonna challenge me next,\nI bet.[VAR 0114(0016)]

I was watchin’ YOUR battle, Bro. It’s how I\nlearned to battle an’ all that.[VAR 0114(000D)]
That right?\c\nThat reminds me. Marnie, there’s somethin’ I\nwanted to tell you.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I want you to take over the Gym here in\nSpikemuth as its Gym Leader.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Yeah, I know.\c\nYou’d planned to retire after the\nChampion Cup, right?[VAR 0114(000D)]
I think you’ve really become a great Gym Leader,\neven if you don’t Dynamax your Pokémon.[VAR 0114(000D)]
I love you, but my answer is a big, fat “NO”![VAR 0114(000D)]
I mean, when I end up becomin’ Champion, I\nwon’t be able to be a Gym Leader![VAR 0114(000D)]
Good point.\c\nIn that case, let your big bro see if you have\nthe skill to be a Champion![VAR 0114(0016)]
Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)], thanks for havin’ an\namazin’ Pokémon battle with my brother.\c\nIt’s my turn next! So clear off for a bit, ’K?[VAR 0114(000D)]

I already told you, didn’t I?\nKeep your eye on the goal!\r\nAnd for you, that’s winning the Gym Challenge![VAR 0114(0004)]
The only Gym Badge left is the one you’ll get\nfrom the Dragon Gym’s Leader, Raihan. Right?\c\nRaihan is the only Trainer out there I consider a\nreal rival. He’s that good, you know![VAR 0114(0004)]
And there I go again! Sorry, but I suppose this is\nno time for me to be stopping for a chat.\r\nThere’s a bit of trouble here with my name on it.\c\nBut don’t you worry about a thing![VAR 0114(0004)]

Where’s Leon?
What was that loud noise?
That’s what I’d like to know!\nThat noise—it was like some massive explosion!\c\nThere was this huge surge of red light, and then\nwild Pokémon just started Dynamaxing around\r\nme, brazen as you like![VAR 0114(0005)]
Take a look at the news![VAR 0114(0005)]
See! There’s Lee!\nHe really is the greatest, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Lee and his Charizard took down that Dynamax\nPokémon in the blink of an eye![VAR 0114(0005)]

Well, if it isn’t [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’d expect nothing less from you and your\nCharizard, Leon!\c\nYou took down that Dynamax Pokémon in no\ntime at all![VAR 0114(000B)]
Well, I am the unbeatable Champion, after all!\nBut what all is going on here?[VAR 0114(0004)]
An overflowing red light...\nPokémon Dynamaxing without a Power Spot?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Yeah, but why?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m not sure... What’s going on?\nThat red light could suddenly appear again at\r\nany time and we’d have no way of knowing.[VAR 0114(000B)]
But being able to predict such things is part of\na scientist’s work.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Gran?![VAR 0114(000B)]
The chairman called for me.\c\nHe wanted to know all about the red light’s\nrelationship to the Dynamax phenomenon.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Did the chairman know anything?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Nothing worth my time. The chairman’s all\nwrapped up in fretting over the future of\r\nour energy, apparently.\c\nHe’s left everything to that executive lady.\nWe just don’t have enough data.[VAR 0114(000A)]
That’s why I wanted to ask you to start looking\ninto things, too, Sonia.\c\nYou know more than anyone about the\nDarkest Day, after all.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Are you saying that red light and the\nDarkest Day are connected?![VAR 0114(000B)]
Hey, do you reckon there’s anything we could do\nto help out?[VAR 0114(0005)]
There must be!
Yeah, we’ll help!
Thanks! I appreciate the thought.\c\nBut all I could ever ask of you would be that you\njoin me in the greatest final match ever.\c\nI’ll do my part to make that happen by keeping\neverybody’s future safe.\c\nSo you just keep on doing your part by winning\nyour way through the Gym Challenge![VAR 0114(0004)]
Right. Course!\nYou’re the unbeatable Champion, after all, eh?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Gran, there’s something I want to look into.\nYou’ll help me, right?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Naturally.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Looks like we all know what we need to do.\nSo, you two—clear the Gym Challenge so we can\r\nmeet again at the Champion Cup![VAR 0114(0004)]
I know what I need to do, all right—\ndefeat that Piers once and for all!\c\nYou’re off to Hammerlocke Stadium, yeah,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]? Raihan’s a tough nut to crack![VAR 0114(0005)]

The long Gym Challenge is nearing its end, I see.\c\nAre you ready to face Hammerlocke Gym and its\nleader, the dragon user Raihan?
You bet I am!
Maybe another time...
You must remember that [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she who dares, wins.
In that case, please use the changing room to\nchange into your uniform.
That uniform you wear is a symbol of all of your\nvictories. I feel your determination.\c\nNow, head to where all the Gym Trainers await...\nNo, not the stadium, but the vault!
Ah, one moment!\c\nYou need at least two battle-ready Pokémon\nto face Raihan!
The Gym mission, right?\nTogether with your partner, you can’t lose!
That uniform fits you to a tee!\nHead on in, number [VAR 01C4(0001)]!
Hold on there! If you want to face Raihan, you\nfirst need to gather seven Gym Badges.\c\nOnly then will Raihan even think about letting\nyou face him!

Let’s see, how many Gym Challengers are left?\nHuh... Not even ten, eh?[VAR 0114(0017)]
All right then.\c\n[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]!\nTime to explain the great Raihan’s Gym mission![VAR 0114(0017)]
The rules are simple!\c\nAll you’ve got to do is defeat three Gym Trainers\nthat I personally trained—in Double Battles![VAR 0114(0017)]
The Gym Challenge is meant to be, well...\nchallenging, wouldn’t you say?\c\nNaturally there aren’t too many Gym Challengers\nwho can make it this far.[VAR 0114(0017)]
And that’s why I provide a format where you can\nreally show off the brilliant combinations you\r\nand your Pokémon should be capable of![VAR 0114(0017)]
That’s probably more than enough out of me.\nTime for someone else to take the spotlight!\c\nCome on, Sebastian! You’ll be first![VAR 0114(0017)]
Yeah, that’s me. Sebastian.\c\nLeader Raihan has taught me two things!\nFirst, that Dragon types are ferociously powerful!\r\nSecond, I need to create an advantage on the\r\nbattlefield to fully utilize that power!
I can see why you’ve managed to make\nit this far!
In Double Battles, it’s important to figure out\nwhat role each of your opponent’s Pokémon play.
It looks like you don’t have two Pokémon\nthat can battle.
Fantastic! I can see those seven Badges you\nhave were well-earned!
A Double Battle...\c\nDo you combine the strength of two Pokémon to\npush through, or do you have one of them\r\nsupport the other?\c\nLet me see what your strategy is!
The Gym mission here requires you to participate\nin Double Battles.\c\nYou need to have at least two Pokémon ready\nfor battle...
Well done!\c\nI am honored to have battled against such a\ntalented Trainer.
If you manage to beat the Trainer who was\nbeside me, you’ll face me next.
Something the matter, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nYou’re not done with my Gym mission yet.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Never mind
I want to withdraw
[~ 18]
Hah! Then hurry up and get it over with!\nI want to battle you already![VAR 0114(0017)]
Are you sure you want to withdraw?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Fair enough.\c\nBut you’re not the type to simply give up, right?\nI’ll be waiting for you to come back soon.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Nice one, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nYou’ve completed my Gym mission!\c\nCome on. Time to head to the Gym Stadium.\nYou’ve earned the right to face me yourself![VAR 0114(0017)]
Time to face the second Trainer!\nCome on, Camilla![VAR 0114(0017)]
You’ve made it to the third and last Trainer!\nYour moment to shine, Aria![VAR 0114(0017)]

Finally, a challenger made it!\nI’ve been waiting for someone to battle...\r\nThough I’ve got to admit I didn’t think it’d be you![VAR 0114(0017)]
But I guess I should’ve expected no less from a\nPokémon Trainer that Leon saw promise in.[VAR 0114(0017)]
And you aim to defeat Leon...\c\nDo you have any idea just how high a hurdle\nthat is?\c\nAs his greatest rival, I guess that I—Raihan—will\nhave to show you![VAR 0114(0017)]
Gym Leader Raihan doesn’t simply control the\nweather. He also seeks two-on-two battles!\c\nYou must be prepared for any situation against\na foe like him![VAR 0114(0017)]
In the aftermath of the furious battle...\c\nI feel as pure and refreshed as when the sky\nclears after a storm.[VAR 0114(0017)]
What can I possibly say?\c\nCalling myself Leon’s rival?\nSeems I’d grown quite conceited for someone\r\nwho can’t even claim the title of Champion!\c\nOverconfident in both myself and my team![VAR 0114(0017)]
I’ll give you what you want, then.\nThe proof of your victory—the Dragon Badge![VAR 0114(0017)]
You can now catch Pokémon of any level!
You’ve collected all of the Gym Badges from\nthe Galar region![VAR 0114(0017)]
Now, win your way through the Semifinals and\nFinals for your chance to challenge Leon!\r\nYou must!\c\nYou owe us that much at least, for beating us in\nbattle here today![VAR 0114(0017)]
You’ve collected all of the Gym Badges...\nAt last it’s time for the Champion Cup!\r\nI look forward to seeing how you all do in battle!
Please accept my congratulations on making\nit through the Gym Challenge!
Do you want to go back to the reception area?

First off, as a sign of my respect...\nHere. TM99. It contains the move Breaking Swipe.[VAR 0114(0017)]
And secondly...here’s the Dragon-type Gym\nuniform, the mark of true strength![VAR 0114(0017)]

There you are, Leon’s little brother!\c\nDon’t worry—I’ll give you a battle that’ll make\nyou want to quit the Gym Challenge altogether![VAR 0114(0017)]
I’ve tried out lots of different strategies, and I’ve\nmade up my mind about how I want to battle.\r\nI’m not gonna lose!\c\nI’m gonna beat you, and [VAR 0100(0000)], and\neven Lee![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll be seeing you, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nLet’s have another epic battle someday!\c\nIf you’re feeling up to it, you might want to go\ntrain hard in the Wild Area![VAR 0114(0017)]

Hey there, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nYou gave Raihan a good thrashing, and that\nmeans you’ve completed the Gym Challenge!\c\nCongratulations, from the bottom of my heart![VAR 0114(000B)]
I really wish we could go celebrate, but I think\nthere’re some things we should talk over.[VAR 0114(000B)]
That light that covered Hammerlocke...\c\nIt was just like the Darkest Day, where it’s said\nthat giant Pokémon went on a rampage and\r\nalmost destroyed the entire Galar region.[VAR 0114(000B)]
It certainly seems to be that way, my dear.\c\nAs you know, we Dynamax our Pokémon today\nusing the energy from Wishing Stars that have\r\nfallen to us.[VAR 0114(000A)]
But we still don’t know how to fully control the\nenergy behind Dynamaxing or how the two\r\nheroes managed to do so.\c\nIn fact, we’re not even really sure who—or what—\nthe two heroes actually were.[VAR 0114(000A)]
The legendary sword and shield...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Sonia, my dearest...\nMy lab coat is yours now.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Are you sure, Gran? I still haven’t finished the\nwork you’ve assigned me.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Think of this as something to help you finish\nthat work.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Professor Sonia!
It looks great!
Y-yeah![VAR 0114(000B)]
The two heroes that protected the Galar region\nfrom the Darkest Day...\c\nAnd the legend of the sword and shield you just\nmentioned... It’s up to you to figure out the truth\r\nbehind it all.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I know, Gran![VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ll do what I can! You or Hop could be the one\nto take down Leon, and I don’t want to miss that!\c\nNot to worry—you can count on me to take care\nof everything!\c\nYou just focus on getting to Wyndon. Go on!\nHead to the station, or you’ll miss your train![VAR 0114(000B)]
The station’s near Route 7, remember?\nNow, off with you, Gym Challenger![VAR 0114(000B)]
There are things that only young people like\nyou can do, and there are other things that\r\nshould be left to the adults.\c\nEveryone has their own role.[VAR 0114(000A)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_1450
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Wait up, [VAR 0100(0000)]! I’m coming, too!\c\nI had Raihan beat in no time!\c\nOnce I got my head on straight and stopped\ndoubting every decision I made, that is... Heh![VAR 0114(0005)]
And you never stopped nattering on through\nthe entire battle...\c\nYou’re pretty different from the Champion in that![VAR 0114(0017)]
But your strength is genuine, as proven by the\nDragon Badge you won from me.\c\nYou came at me with all the force of a raging\nstorm, and even I was blown away![VAR 0114(0017)]
Listen up, you two!\c\nBattle your way through the Champion Cup\ntournament to face Leon! One of you ought to![VAR 0114(0017)]
I reckon I’m still the favorite to win, but I’m up\nagainst my true rival, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nSo I’ll wring out every last thing I learned during\nmy battle with you, Raihan, to beat h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer![VAR 0114(0005)]
So get a move on, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nThe train’s waiting![VAR 0114(0005)]

So this is Route 10!\nIt’s like a wall made out of snow![VAR 0114(0005)]

Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nReckon we’ll be able to train ourselves up to new\nheights here, before the Champion Cup starts?[VAR 0114(0005)]

You get it, don’t you, mate?\c\nAfter all, I’m about to become the new\nChampion of the Galar region![VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s it!\nI’m headed straight for Wyndon Stadium![VAR 0114(0005)]
Don’t waste too much time, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nYou should head there yourself![VAR 0114(0005)]

Turns out I was the first to register for the\nChampion Cup.\c\nIn other words, I’m already number one.\nIt’s pretty much in the bag that I’ll win this thing![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], correct?\c\nWe’ve been watching over your performance in\nthe Gym Challenge.\c\nThis is just a formality, of course, but I’ll need\nto check your Gym Badges, if you don’t mind.

But it looks like Bede couldn’t make it.\nHard luck...\c\nSomehow I didn’t think he’d just take being\ndisqualified lying down, you know what I mean?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I guess it is what it is...\c\nCome on, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nWe should head to the locker room![VAR 0114(0005)]
This is it. I really made it.\c\nI made it through the Gym Challenge. There\nmight be four remainin’ in the Semifinals...\c\nBut I’m the one who’s gonna win through\nand battle the Champion.[VAR 0114(000D)]

We’ve been expecting you,\nChallenger [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nAs the Champion Cup is about to begin, allow\nme to explain how it works...\c\nFirst, there are the Semifinals, where you will face\nthe other Trainers who completed the\r\nGym Challenge.\c\nIf you manage to win in the Semifinals, you will\nthen face the top seven Gym Leaders of the\r\nGalar region in the Finals.\c\nDefeat them, and you will finally be able to face\nthe Champion in the Championship Match.
The matches will begin shortly.\nPlease ready yourself and head to the pitch.

You again, eh?\nWell, best of luck to you, kid.\c\nNot that it’ll do you a lick of good.\nMarnie’s sure to win this thing.[VAR 0114(0043)]

But the truth is, when all’s said and done...\nI really just wanna become Champion for myself![VAR 0114(000D)]
So don’t take it personal when I kick your butt![VAR 0114(000D)]
Everyone in the stadium was watchin’ us durin’\nall that...\c\nI heard them cheerin’ for me and my Pokémon.\nIt was nice...[VAR 0114(000D)]
I may have lost, but...\c\nAt least we drove the audience wild!\c\nGuess that’s not so bad![VAR 0114(000D)]
Think I’ll join my brother in the stands, and\nwe’ll watch from the sidelines to see who ends\r\nup challengin’ the Champion.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Just so y’know... I still haven’t decided if\nI’m gonna cheer for you... See ya![VAR 0114(000D)]

After seeing the way you battled, I can’t accept\nany outcome besides winning this match!\c\nMy team is on fire![VAR 0114(0005)]
Pardon me...
I know you didn’t get a long break, but the match\nbefore yours ended more quickly than expected...
Challenger Hop won quite handily, so as soon as\nyou’re ready, we’d like you back on the pitch.

I just had this sort of flashback, you know.\nRemember? Back when we were still in Postwick.[VAR 0114(0005)]
When we got our Pokémon from Lee that day,\nI never would’ve dreamed that I’d end up\r\nstanding here...facing you, of all people.[VAR 0114(0005)]
But it’s time I finish what was started that day...\nGot it? The one who’ll become Champion is me![VAR 0114(0005)]
And the victor of the Semifinals, the challenger\nwho has won their way through all of the many\r\nhopeful Trainers in the Gym Challenge is...\r\nChallenger [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0018)]
You know, even when Sonia was saying that you\nand me looked like we could become heroes,\r\nI really never felt like one...[VAR 0114(0005)]
But you, mate! I think maybe you really could do\nall sorts of great things![VAR 0114(0005)]
Good on you, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nAnd [VAR 0101(0001)]![VAR 0114(0005)]

[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nThat was incredible. Brilliant.\c\nHonestly...there were even tears rolling down my\nface before I knew it.[VAR 0114(0004)]
To think that the two of you set out together\nfrom the same town, built up the greatest teams,\r\nand arrived here at this point to throw everything\r\nyou had at one another...[VAR 0114(0004)]
That burning desire to win...\nThose moves filled with undefeatable passion!\c\nIt was battling at its very purest, in every\npossible way![VAR 0114(0004)]
Even though there were some Trainers who\nweren’t sure whether you were fit to be endorsed\r\nfor the Gym Challenge at first...[VAR 0114(0004)]
That was you, Lee![VAR 0114(0005)]
Well then, all the more reason!\c\nMy team members and I will give everything that\nwe’ve got in us to defeat our challenger.[VAR 0114(0004)]
And the challenger standing before us might well\nend up being you, [VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nIn fact, that’s precisely what I’m hoping for![VAR 0114(0004)]
That’s right, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nThe real challenge is what’s coming next.[VAR 0114(0005)]
And I’m completely exhausted!\nI just want to head back to the hotel and rest.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Best to refill your energy stores first!\nWhy don’t we go get some dinner together?[VAR 0114(0004)]
I wouldn’t say no, but...\c\nyou never care at all what food tastes like, Lee!\c\nA night like this deserves more than rubbish\ntakeaway, so at least pick something good![VAR 0114(0005)]

Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nHey, Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]!
Got some time for questions?!
First question!\c\nYou and Challenger Hop were both endorsed by\nthe Champion, making the two of you rivals in a\r\nsense, wouldn’t you say?\c\nHow does it feel to have defeated your rival?
I’m glad I could beat him
It doesn’t quite feel real yet
It was just luck that I won
Right...\nQuestion number two!\c\nIf you wanted to tell Challenger Hop something\nright now, what would it be?
I’d thank him for the great match!
I’d tell him how strong he was
That he was just the rival I knew he was
Question three!\c\nLevel with me, kiddo. Your honest thoughts here.\nThink you can win the Finals, too?
I absolutely do
I’m not sure...
I doubt it, really...
All right—that’s enough!\n[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]’s already tired from battle!\r\nAnd you’ve been asking rather rude questions![VAR 0114(0005)]
We’ve got ourselves dinner plans with my brother,\nso, sorry, but clear off already, would you?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Yes, yes, I understand!\nLooking forward to seeing the birth of a new star!
Phew...\nFamous people sure have it rough, eh?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I hope Lee gets here soon.\nI could eat my own arm about now.[VAR 0114(0005)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_1570

Several hours later...
This is absurd...\nEven Lee’s never this late. Something’s not right.[VAR 0114(0005)]
He always does what he says he’ll do.\c\nAs a kid, he promised me he’d become Champion\none day, and he went and did just that![VAR 0114(0005)]
He ought to be able to keep to his own\ndinner plans![VAR 0114(0005)]
Kid’s sure got a mouth on him, huh?\c\nIf you were that noisy durin’ battle, you’d\nunleash a whole new level of power, you know.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Oh, pack it in, Piers!\nI’m seriously worried here!\c\nSo I don’t need to see your smug mug looking\nlike you’re having a go at me, even though you\r\nact like you’re giving me good advice![VAR 0114(0005)]
Judgin’ by appearances?\nNo wonder you lost to your mate.[VAR 0114(0016)]
If you’re lookin’ for the Champion, I saw him\nheadin’ to Rose Tower.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Why would he go there?
Rose Tower?
Dunno what he’s up to, but I ran into him at the\nmonorail platform.\c\nHe said to tell you that he had somethin’ to do\nat Rose Tower, so he’d be late to your dinner.[VAR 0114(0016)]
But why Rose Tower?\nWhat could he have to do there at this hour?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Piers, do us a favor.\nTake us to Rose Tower, would you?\c\nNeither [VAR 0100(0000)] nor I know the way.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Sheesh... What rude siblings, always so\ndemandin’ of others.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Though I s’ppose...\c\nIt’s a real problem for me, too, if the Finals are\nheld up for any reason.\c\nAnd I don’t really hate the two of you little runts.\nYou were good enough to beat me, after all.[VAR 0114(0016)]
So I think I’ll invite Team Yell along, and we’ll all\nhave ourselves a bit of fun. Shall we?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Brilliant! You’re the best, Piers!\nLet’s go make a real ruckus![VAR 0114(0005)]

Man, why am I here for this? I’m totally\nexhausted from that battle with\r\nyou, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(000D)]
We decided that Team Yell will cheer you on,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]. Let’s help out together.[VAR 0114(0016)]
What a beautiful display of sibling love!\nHowever, it is entirely unnecessary.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Ms. Oleana?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Chairman Rose is with the Champion in a very,\nvery important meeting...[VAR 0114(0007)]
There is no way I will let anyone interfere![VAR 0114(0007)]
After all, only authorized personnel with the\nproper key can ride the monorail to Rose Tower.[VAR 0114(0007)]
That means as long as Chairman Rose is in the\ntower, no one can disturb him![VAR 0114(0007)]
I have hand selected a member of the\nLeague staff and given them a key.\c\nChairman Rose does enjoy these kind of menial\ngames after all.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Do you think you can tell the difference between\nnormal League staff and the one I chose?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Do you think you can find me?
What should we do?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Tch. This isn’t good! But I got this one![VAR 0114(0016)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! Team Yell’s yellin’ will\nhandle this![VAR 0114(0016)]
No. This is brilliant! I’ll search around the front of\nthe stadium![VAR 0114(0005)]
For now, we should try to head to the plaza\ntogether, right?[VAR 0114(0016)]
All right, let’s all work together and head for\nRose Tower.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Hmm. You should be able to get to the plaza\nyourself, right?[VAR 0114(0016)]

Let’s find Oleana’s League staff member.\c\nThat bad one was wearin’ those lame\nshades, right?[VAR 0114(0016)]
That bad League staff member was wearin’ some\nawful shades.\c\nAnd the key to findin’ anyone is to just ask\neveryone you meet![VAR 0114(0016)]
Seems like nobody’s seen that bad League staff\nmember anywhere else.\c\nI bet they’re hidin’ somewhere nearby.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Makes sense for a cornered person to seek out\nthe tightest hidin’ place, I guess.\r\nDon’t s’ppose you got a box lyin’ around?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Guess that wraps up Oleana’s little game.\c\nCourse, I’m not one to talk, I guess.\nTeam Yell did their fair share of lame tricks...\c\nAnyway, let’s head to the station.[VAR 0114(0016)]
... ... ...
Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]! This bloke’s awfully shifty,\nbut I can’t get him to turn around!\c\nSay somethin’ surprisin’ so that he’ll have no\nchoice but to look this way!
Ms. Oleana’s here!
We already have the key, you know
What?!
Blast, I turned around!\c\nAnd I can’t escape?!\nIn that case, time for a Pokémon battle!
All I need to do is hide, and I won’t have to\ngive you the key!
It’s a wonder how fast that guy could run...\nI’ve got no idea where he went, guv.
How’d you find me...?\nOr did you just talk to everyone you met?!\r\nBah, whatever! I’ll defeat you this time!
They say hide a tree in a forest, so...\nI thought I could hide myself in the crowd!
You’re way too observant!\nBut I’ll win this time and make my getaway!
Seems like you’ve got me cornered...\c\nBut I’m not going to give up!\nAn earful from Ms. Oleana is way worse than\r\nanything you lot can do!\c\nGood luck catching me on the monorail!
Team Yell, go find Hop!\nWe’ll corner that League staff member at the\r\nstation together![VAR 0114(0016)]
You did a crackin’ job of cornerin’ that bad\nLeague staff member, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nLet me sing you a song fittin’ of your\nrockin’ deeds![VAR 0114(0016)]
The only thing a humble singer can do is sing a\nhumble song. ♪[VAR 0114(0016)]
Maybe I can’t cheer someone on just with the\ntunes I play. ♪[VAR 0114(0016)]
Maybe my songs don’t make anyone happy.\nMaybe I can’t help. ♪[VAR 0114(0016)]
But still the only thing I can do is sing—sing my\nhumble song. ♪[VAR 0114(0016)]
Piers!
Go Pieeerrrs!
Hey, isn’t that Piers?\nWhy’s he doing a street performance?
I think you mean a station performance.\nCome on—let’s see if we can get closer!
We got the key, Piers!\nWe can take the monorail to Rose Tower now!
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! Hop!\nNow’s your chance! Go! Get outta here![VAR 0114(0016)]

So this is Rose Tower!\c\nJust how tall do you think it is?\nI can’t even see the top, up there in the clouds.[VAR 0114(0005)]
So what should we do?\c\nTeam Yell is gonna have their hands full\nholdin’ up those bad League staff members.\r\nThey won’t be catchin’ up anytime soon.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Yeah, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nWhat should we do?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Let’s go ahead!
Wait for the others to catch up?
Good thinking!\nLet’s go collect Lee and get out of here!\c\nWithout him, there’s no Champion for you to\nchallenge in the Champion Cup![VAR 0114(0005)]
’Fraid I can’t agree to that, mate.\c\nTeam Yell’s giving it their all to help us out so\nwe can go ahead and help Lee.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], you cleared the way to\nRose Tower.\c\nNow all you gotta do is charge on ahead.[VAR 0114(000D)]
An employee’s an employee I guess...\nSeems that exec lady hid the monorail key\r\nto try and impress the chairman.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Chairman Rose’s been keepin’ the Champion\nholed up inside. Wonder what he’s plottin’.[VAR 0114(000D)]

Times like this—when tension and passion run\nhigh—remind me of Spikemuth in the old days.\c\nSome right wild concerts we had back then.\nBut no encores![VAR 0114(0016)]

Listen, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nDon’t know if you knew this already, but I’ve\nheard Rose Tower was built on a Power Spot.\c\nYeah, you know what I’m saying...\nWhen we get up to the roof and have a bit of\r\nspace, we can Dynamax our Pokémon![VAR 0114(0005)]
Which is all well and good. But less certain is\nwhether this lift can get us to the top...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Rose Tower has, like, a hundred floors, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
You’ll be leaving right now, so there’s no need to\nworry about the lift!
Intruder alert.\nIntruder alert.\c\nAll staff are ordered to help remove the\nintruders from the premises at once.[VAR 0114(0007)]
See? If Ms. Oleana says so, then it looks like this\nis the end of the line for you kids.
If I get rid of the intruders, I’ll probably get a\nbig bonus!
M-my bonus...\nMy dream of finally affording a house of my own...
We need to speak with Chairman Rose!\nTell us where he is![VAR 0114(0005)]
Get on the lift.\nThe chairman’s at the top of the building.
All right! We’re nearly to Chairman Rose![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hold on, Lee! We’re coming![VAR 0114(0005)]

This is taking ages...[VAR 0114(0005)]
What? I don’t think we’re at the roof yet...\nWhy have we stopped?[VAR 0114(0005)]
You two are Gym Challengers, aren’t you?\c\nThank you for taking part in the Galar League’s\nGym Challenge!\c\nYet I’m afraid that doesn’t give you the right to\ninterfere in our work.\c\nWe will drive you out to protect the many\nsubsidiary companies housed here in Rose Tower!
Behold the gloriously high-tech elevators of\nRose Tower, able to withstand Pokémon battles!\c\nThey are constructed by the subsidiary\nMacro Cosmos Construction!
If I’ve been defeated, I have little choice but to\nrespectfully retreat.\c\nYet I must ask once more that you please do not\ninterfere with Chairman Rose’s work.
The elevators in Rose Tower are constructed so\nthat only the floor ascends.\c\nBut that presents some danger, thus the presence\nof these walls constructed of light.\c\nYou can thank Macro Cosmos Construction for\nproviding this wonderful technology as well.
Wait... So the folks working in the tower can stop\nthe elevator from the outside at any time?\c\nWe’re just trying to get to the top already![VAR 0114(0005)]
Our teams have been working themselves ragged\nfor us. Let me heal them all up.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Rose Tower is almost a thousand feet tall!\nYou are now about five hundred feet above\r\nthe ground!
I’m from MC Insurance!\nDo you have a life insurance policy?
I’m quite terrified of heights, actually...
Unfortunately, our insurance doesn’t pay out\nfor being defeated in Pokémon battles...
You’re nearly to the top!\nBut you’ll not be meeting the chairman!
I’ve got no fear of heights!\c\nI work high in the skies doing my job for the\nlofty Macro Cosmos Air!
Don’t you presume to meet the chairman!\nYou’re not on the same level as such a great man!
You must know that in high-rises such as this one,\nthe higher up you go, the more important the\r\npeople you find working there.\c\nChairman Rose is at the top of the top!\nNot just of this tower, but of all Galar!
Looks as though we’re nearly there, mate...\nLook sharp! Let’s do this![VAR 0114(0005)]

Welcome to Chairman Rose’s exclusive space.\nHere, nearly a thousand feet above the earth![VAR 0114(0007)]
So, you got through all of the special staff that\nI had ordered to stop you.\c\nI would expect nothing less of the Trainers\nhandpicked by Champion Leon himself.[VAR 0114(0007)]
But I am afraid it is now time for you to\ngo home.[VAR 0114(0007)]

I will not allow anyone to disturb the great\nChairman Rose![VAR 0114(0007)]
You shall be the first, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nIf I beat you to pieces, then the Champion will\nhave no one to battle and will thus lose heart.\c\nIn that state, he will listen to anything the\nchairman says![VAR 0114(0007)]
Arghhh!\nThis is inexcusable...\c\nWhat was I thinking... Any Gym Challenger who’s\nmade it this far would be no pushover...[VAR 0114(0007)]
Under normal circumstances, I would have tried\nto delay you further.\c\nHowever, all the necessary Wishing Stars have\nbeen collected. Do as you wish. There is nothing\r\nto be done now.[VAR 0114(0007)]

Look around us, Leon!\nLook at the Galar region stretched out before us.\c\nAnd know that the energy required to keep this\nbrilliant, glittering world alive will be exhausted\r\na millennium from now!\c\nThe people of Galar today will no longer even\nexist. What Galar wants today hardly matters![VAR 0114(0006)]
The future is more important than just one day!\nWe must act as quickly as we possibly can!\c\nWe must take action in order to avert tragedy!\nSo that all can look forward to a better future![VAR 0114(0006)]
LEON: In a thousand years!\c\nFine. Look.\nI think I understand your concerns, Chairman.\c\nAnd I give my word I’ll help you with your plans...\njust as soon as tomorrow’s match is over.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Lee...\c\nYou never showed when you were supposed to,\nso I got worried that something had happened...\c\nPiers and Marnie and all those Team Yell oddballs,\nthey all helped us out to get here...[VAR 0114(0005)]
I must apologize to you, Hop, if we’ve made you\nworry at all.\c\nThere are times when adults just can’t seem to\nhave an honest discussion with one another.\c\nSometimes our pride just gets in the way.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Never mind any of this, Hop, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nLet’s head back to the hotel, and we’ll all grab\ndinner together, yeah?\c\nIt’s on me, so you can order whatever you fancy.[VAR 0114(0004)]
If you’ll excuse us, Chairman Rose...\c\nAnd I do hope you’ll watch tomorrow’s match.\nIt’s sure to be one for the history books.[VAR 0114(0004)]
One for the history books...\c\nYou still don’t understand, young Champion...\nWe... No, I am going to change the course\r\nof history![VAR 0114(0006)]

The next evening...
This is it.\nDid you get enough sleep?[VAR 0114(0005)]
You and your team are the ones battling, but I’ve\nhad Butterfree in my stomach since I woke up...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nThe Finals will be starting shortly.\nI’m here to escort you to the stadium.
What’s all this! Didn’t learn your lesson yesterday?!\c\nIf you need another helping of Hop and his trusty\n[VAR 0101(0001)], I’ll be happy to give you one![VAR 0114(0005)]
No! Wait, please!\c\nI’m not like those other League staff!\nI’m a good one! If I may say so myself...
I heard about what happened yesterday.\c\nMs. Oleana can be a little extreme in her desire\nto assist the chairman with his goals, I’m afraid.
It seems she was cultivating her own group of\nLeague staff in secret to be deployed for...\r\nwell...things like that debacle last night.
But you’ve no need to worry about today’s staff!\nAll of us are here for the right reasons.
Well, that’s what she says...\c\nI guess we trust her, then, yeah, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nLet’s go! I can’t wait another minute![VAR 0114(0005)]
Would you like me to show you the way to\nWyndon Stadium?
Then let’s be on our way!
Understood.\c\nCome talk with me again if you need any help,\nor use one of the Flying Taxis out front.

Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)].\nWe’ve been waiting for you.\c\nSince you won your way through the Semifinals,\nyou must face off against the Gym Leaders in the\r\nFinals. And they won’t be holding back.\c\nWhoever makes it through this final bracket will\nwin the right to challenge the Champion...\r\nSo, are you ready to go to the locker room now?
Yes, straightaway
Not yet
Then I’ll show you the way.
Then let me know when you’re ready.

Will you be heading onto the pitch?\nThe opening ceremony should be starting soon.
I’m ready!
Not yet
Then in you go!
Would you like to speak with the others for one\nlast spot of advice?
I’ll always press on and challenge myself so that\nI can go on as a Pokémon Trainer for as long\r\nas possible.\c\nAs long as you continue to push yourself, your\nbrilliance will never fade.[VAR 0114(0010)]
My first match is against Raihan of all people?\nWhat rotten luck...\c\nBut even if he changes the weather around,\nI don’t plan on throwing in the towel so easy.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Long time no see! This’ll be a different sort of\nbattle than you faced in the Gym Challenge.\c\nThose were basically test matches, but this...\nThis is serious battle.[VAR 0114(000F)]
It’s a curious feeling...\nMy heart is racing a bit, but I still can’t wait for\r\nthe match to begin![VAR 0114(0011)]
I’ll be bringing my matches to an end in\na heartbeat—you’ll see.\c\nNo one who sees them will ever forget me.[VAR 0114(0014)]
I’m going to win my way through every round,\nthen I’ll be the one taking on Leon!\c\nIf I don’t, then I’ll have failed to repay Duraludon\nand the rest of my team for all their hard work![VAR 0114(0017)]
I’d say I aim to win this thing...\c\nAnd I’ll do it without usin’ Dynamax, to help\neveryone in Spikemuth reclaim their pride...\r\nand to see ’em smile once again.[VAR 0114(0016)]
The opening ceremony will begin momentarily.\nPlease head to the pitch at once.

Wait, you![VAR 0114(0042)]
Who’s that?[VAR 0114(006B)]
A moment, if I may.\nDoes anyone here even remember me?\c\nI am Bede, the challenger who was forced to\nwithdraw from the Gym Challenge![VAR 0114(000C)]
Bede! He’s the challenger endorsed by Chairman\nRose himself![VAR 0114(006B)]
I have a score to settle with\nChallenger [VAR 0100(0000)] here.\c\nI’m aware that this is against the rules, but I must\nask nonetheless...\c\nLet me battle h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer! I’ll stake my career as a\nchallenger on this battle. If I lose, I’ll retire from\r\nbeing a Trainer.[VAR 0114(000C)]
What an unexpected turn of events!\c\nFormer Challenger Bede has come for one\nlast battle![VAR 0114(0018)]
We are currently debating what to do with\nChallenger Bede.\c\nTo all our viewers, both here in the stadium and\nat home in front of the telly, we ask that you\r\nplease be patient![VAR 0114(0018)]
I know this is ridiculous of me.\nBut I had to say something...do something![VAR 0114(000C)]
Ever since you showed up, everything I’ve done\nhas gone wrong!\c\nIt was Oleana who asked me to gather Wishing\nStars for the chairman, but then the chairman\r\nhimself disowned me...[VAR 0114(000C)]
And then that strange old lady comes out of\nnowhere and drags me into a boot camp on\r\nFairy-type Pokémon!\c\nDo you have any idea what I’ve been through?!\nCovered in pink, dealing with quizzes and battles\r\nwith Fairy-type Pokémon every day![VAR 0114(000C)]
And here I am, pouring my heart out to you...\nwhen I’ve never lost my cool before![VAR 0114(000C)]
We’ve reached a decision, ladies and gentlemen!\nThe Champion himself has accepted Bede’s\r\nsudden interruption!\c\nIs the Champion showing his love...by giving\nevery Trainer a chance to grow stronger?\r\nOr is it a trial for Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0018)]
My will hasn’t been broken yet![VAR 0114(000C)]
Well, I lost...[VAR 0114(000C)]
It looks like Challenger Bede was no match for\nChallenger [VAR 0100(0000)] and h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser trusted team![VAR 0114(0018)]
Hey, Bede! That was some match![VAR 0114(006B)]
Don’t retire! Just restart your career![VAR 0114(006B)]
B-but this isn’t what I planned!\c\nIf I was able to defeat you, then everything\nwould be fine.\c\nEven if I lost, I was going to use retiring as an\nexcuse to get away from that old lady![VAR 0114(000C)]
You just keep messing up my plans!\c\nWith everyone cheering me on like this, I have\nno choice but to continue my training as the\r\nFairy-type Gym Leader![VAR 0114(000C)]
Though I suppose with my talents, I’ll be able\nto overtake Ms. Opal in no time.[VAR 0114(000C)]
The stadium is filled with voices cheering on\nthese two young Trainers!\c\nNow, Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)], please head\nback to the locker room so that you can rest up\r\nfrom that unexpected match...[VAR 0114(0018)]
Rather surprising for Challenger Bede to barge\nin like that...\c\nIn any case, once you’re ready, please head onto\nthe pitch. The Finals are about to begin.

The time for waiting is over! The Finals of\nthe Champion Cup are about to begin!\c\nThe two Trainers to face each other in the first\nbattle of the first round are...[VAR 0114(0018)]
A Trainer endorsed by the Champion himself,\nChallenger [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0018)]
H[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser opponent is...\c\nthe raging wave!\nThe master of Water types, Nessa![VAR 0114(0018)]
I can tell you’ve grown far stronger since you\nfaced me in Hulbury Stadium.\c\nI’ve got to hand it to our undefeated Champion.\nHe’s got a proper eye for talent, too.[VAR 0114(000F)]
But you’re not the Champion, and you’ll never\nbecome the Champion, either.\c\nDo you know why? It’s because I, Nessa, am\ngoing to defeat both you and Leon![VAR 0114(000F)]
I’m not going to underestimate you again.\c\nI’ll use Dynamax to wash you out to sea and\nbeyond the horizon![VAR 0114(000F)]
Aaaaaand the winner is...[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe defeated Nessa during the Gym Challenge\nand now has pulled it off again![VAR 0114(0018)]
You and your Pokémon are just too much...\c\nEven with my Dynamaxed partner, you weathered\nour waves and stood firm.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Now that I think about it, Sonia was saying\nsomething about how amazing you were.\c\nI wish I’d paid more attention to what she\nwas talking about.[VAR 0114(000F)]
I bet everyone in Galar’s got their eyes on\nyou now.\c\nYou defeated my team, so now you’ve got to\nride that current all the way to the end![VAR 0114(000F)]
Now...don’t go anywhere, ladies and gentlemen!\nThe second battle of the first round will\r\nbegin shortly![VAR 0114(0018)]

Ladies and gentlemen, we’re already at the\nsecond match of the Finals!\c\nOf the four remaining challengers, which two\nwill be left for the last match?![VAR 0114(0018)]
If you’re just tuning in, ladies and gentlemen, we\nwitnessed quite the surprise during the Finals\r\nhere at this year’s Champion Cup, as the former\r\nGym Challenger Bede stormed the stage!\c\nBut [VAR 0100(0000)] was having none of it!\c\nThis year’s top challenger made quick work of\nhim before washing away Gym Leader Nessa![VAR 0114(0018)]
On the other side, we have...\c\nthe Galar karate prodigy!\nLet’s hear it for Gym Leader Bea, everybody![VAR 0114(0018)]
I promise you, my attacks will shake your very\nsoul this time.[VAR 0114(0011)]
May the best Trainer win.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Bea has been defeated!\nChallenger [VAR 0100(0000)] has shown h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser skill![VAR 0114(0018)]
Thank you for a wonderful match.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I really enjoyed battling you and your team...\c\nI’m upset that I lost, but I also feel so satisfied\nand so refreshed...[VAR 0114(0011)]
In a way, I guess you could say it was the best\nsort of match anyone could ever hope for.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I hope that you’ll meet many more Trainers\nand have many more matches in the future.\c\nAnd I hope that every one of those encounters\nwill nourish your spirit.[VAR 0114(0011)]
The next match will begin in no time, so stay in\nthose seats, folks![VAR 0114(0018)]

You’re really something else, kid.\nYou’ve made it all the way here!\c\nI guess that’s why the Champion himself\nendorsed you, yeah?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Leon’s my rival—and he chose you. So I’ve got to\nfirst prove I’m better than you if I’m to beat him!\c\nI’ve reworked my whole team, and now we’re all\ngeared up for one-on-one battles![VAR 0114(0017)]

That video stream...\nThat was from Hammerlocke Stadium, right?\r\nWhat in the world did the chairman do...?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I don’t know!\c\nBut everything he was saying yesterday...\nDid he really pull this crazy stunt to solve some\r\nproblem a thousand years in the future?!\c\nI’ve got to go see what’s going on...\nI’m the Champion! I have to go![VAR 0114(0004)]
I should’ve realized what the chairman intended\nto do before it came to this...\c\nI’ll take responsibility now for fixing this mess![VAR 0114(0004)]
This is the real Champion time![VAR 0114(0004)]
But, Lee! You’re terrible at directions...\nWhat if you get lost along the way?[VAR 0114(0005)]

I’m here to stop the Darkest Day!
To search for the sword Pokémon
To search for the shield Pokémon
To stop the Darkest Day...\c\nYou mean you’re going to search for the sword\nand shield Pokémon?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I suppose if the legends are true, then the sword\nand shield Pokémon should be able to prevent\r\nthe Darkest Day from coming to pass...\c\nThey may be just what we need to beat back\nthe black storm![VAR 0114(000B)]
OK! Here, take this.\nYou should head to the Slumbering Weald.\c\nI’ll catch up with you once I’m done looking\ninto something that’s been bothering me.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ve got to keep looking into the origin of the\nsword and shield Pokémon![VAR 0114(000B)]
All that matters is that you do what you can.\nYou’ve become a fine Pokémon Trainer,\r\nafter all![VAR 0114(0008)]

Ready for this, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I wonder if we’re about to head straight into\na wall of fog again...\c\nNot that it’d bother us now. We’ve both grown\nloads stronger and so have our Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Going into the forest after Wooloo that day...\c\nThat was the start of everything, wasn’t it?\nA legendary beginning, really...[VAR 0114(0005)]
I reckon whatever we’re about to see will be\npretty legendary itself!\r\nLet’s head in and add another page to our tale![VAR 0114(0005)]

They really are here...\nThe sword and the shield Pokémon! I knew it![VAR 0114(0005)]

Hey! Where’re you going?!\nWe need your help over here![VAR 0114(0005)]
You two...\nWhat in the world are you doing?[VAR 0114(000B)]
What?! Come off it, Sonia!\nYou must’ve seen that, right?!\c\nThose...those...sword and shield Pokémon!\nThey were right in front of us!\c\nBut then they disappeared into the forest...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hop, you sure you haven’t lost the plot?\nThere was no one here but the two of you...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Wha...\nThen were those just...illusions or something?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Listen! I dug into some literature from other\nregions, and I finally found something!\c\nMentions of the sword Pokémon, Zacian,\nand the shield Pokémon, called Zamazenta.\c\nThe writings said that those two Pokémon were\nborn somewhere beyond the Slumbering Weald\r\nsometime long, long ago.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Did they really?\nTa, Sonia. Thanks for digging into it.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Even if it is just an illusion or whatever, we did\nmanage to find that Pokémon again...\c\nMaybe the sword and the shield that those two\nused to carry are still here, too![VAR 0114(0005)]
Zacian and Zamazenta...\c\nThey may have been sleeping in the Slumbering\nWeald right next to your hometown all this time.\c\nPerhaps that’s why no one has entered the\ndeepest parts of these woods for so long...[VAR 0114(000B)]

Would you take a look at that, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nNow that’s something you don’t see every day...\r\nThis place definitely feels like the stuff of legend.[VAR 0114(0005)]

See that, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
The sword and the shield!\nThe legends really were true![VAR 0114(0005)]
That settles it!\nI’m taking the shield![VAR 0114(0005)]
That settles it!\nI’m taking the sword![VAR 0114(0005)]
Though...wow, would you look at the state\nof this thing?\c\nIt seems like it might fall to pieces if you so much\nas look at it funny.\c\nI don’t know if these rusty old things will really\nbe able to stop the Darkest Day, but...\c\nWell, I guess it can’t hurt to have them along!\nLet’s hope they bring us some good luck![VAR 0114(0005)]

Maybe the Pokémon themselves really are still\nasleep somewhere.\c\nSo it seems we’re on our own if we want to go\nhelp Lee. This is all the help we’ve got![VAR 0114(0005)]
If anybody’s gonna help Lee now, I guess it’s just\nyou and me, mate!\c\nHe’s probably still at Hammerlocke Stadium,\ntrying to keep the Darkest Day at bay.\c\nSo what d’you say, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nWanna grab a Flying Taxi to head right there?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Let’s go!
Not yet
Then let’s get out of this gloomy forest and fly\nback to Hammerlocke![VAR 0114(0005)]
Can’t say I blame you... Even I’m a bit gutted\nto have come all this way chasing legends\r\nonly to find a rusty old sword and shield...[VAR 0114(0005)]

Well, if it isn’t [VAR 0100(0000)] and Hop!\c\nIt’s a real shame, the way things have turned out.\c\nYou make it all the way to the Championship\nMatch, then something like this has to happen![VAR 0114(0017)]
And Chairman Rose thinking that the energy\npouring from the Darkest Day would somehow be\r\nthe key to saving Galar’s future?\c\nIt all seems a bit mad, if you ask me...\nI can’t follow at all how that’s supposed to work.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Well, I don’t care if I’m up against the Darkest\nDay or the chairman or whatever!\c\nI’m going ahead! I’m off to help my brother![VAR 0114(0005)]
And he’s gone... That Hop never changes.\nAlways in a rush about something, isn’t he?[VAR 0114(0017)]
The key thing is that no one’s been harmed.\c\nWe Gym Leaders worked together with the city’s\nPokémon, and we’ve got everyone evacuated.[VAR 0114(0017)]
And you, you’re fixing to help our Champion?\nTo save everyone in the Galar region?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Of course I am
That’s where I’m going now!
Our greatest-ever Champion and the greatest-\never challenger, along with h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser fiercest rival...\c\nall teaming up against the Darkest Day...\nI almost feel sorry for it![VAR 0114(0017)]

G-Gym Challenger!\nYou must help me!\r\nI-I mean, please, help me![VAR 0114(0007)]
My Pokémon suddenly Dynamaxed for some\nreason and started running amok in\r\nthe stadium...[VAR 0114(0007)]
Raihan...I mean, Mr. Raihan was able to subdue\nthe Dynamax Pokémon in the stadium, but...[VAR 0114(0007)]
If other Pokémon also Dynamax and\ngo on a rampage...[VAR 0114(0007)]
the underground power plant would collapse!\nMr. Rose is down there right now![VAR 0114(0007)]
I know this is selfish of me, but I must beg\nyour assistance!\c\nI want you to head into the underground power\nplant and stop Mr. Rose![VAR 0114(0007)]
Mr. Rose has awakened a Pokémon known\nas Eternatus...\r\nApparently, the energy emitted from its body is\r\nwhat causes Dynamaxing.[VAR 0114(0007)]
At this rate, all the Pokémon in the Galar region\nwill Dynamax and go berserk!\c\nIf that were to happen—[VAR 0114(0007)]
Please, you must save Mr. Rose! You can take the\nlift over there to reach him.\c\nI’ve enlisted the help of the Champion’s younger\nbrother, too, but who knows what is going on...[VAR 0114(0007)]
Oh no... Eternatus is—\nOh, Mr. Rose...[VAR 0114(0007)]

And what do you plan on doing,\nGym Challenger?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Stopping the Darkest Day!
Helping the Champion
Uh, pardon?\nWhat are you talking about?\c\nThere’s nothing to stop now. We’ve already\nbrought about the Darkest Day...or should I say,\r\nthe ultimate Pokémon—Eternatus![VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m afraid I can’t allow that.\c\nThe Champion is the one who needs to\ncontrol Eternatus.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Must I explain myself?\c\nFrom your perspective, I suppose it must\nseem that I am doing something terrible.\r\nI don’t expect you to understand.\c\nBut I must provide the Galar region with limitless\nenergy to ensure everlasting prosperity.\c\nIt is my purpose, my duty, my destiny![VAR 0114(0006)]
That’s why we’ve been giving the Wishing Stars\nto Eternatus!\c\nSurely you remember the red light that caused a\nruckus around Hammerlocke. That was all part of\r\nour experiments to awaken Eternatus!\c\nYou must understand. I can’t let you interfere\nwith my plan to protect the future of Galar![VAR 0114(0006)]

I wouldn’t expect any less from a challenger\nendorsed by the strongest Champion ever to\r\ngrace our beloved Galar region![VAR 0114(0006)]
I really do wish I could have seen the\nChampionship Match between you two.\c\nAnd I’m terribly sorry to have ruined the whole\nGym Challenge and everything![VAR 0114(0006)]
It’s too bad, but it can’t be helped...\c\nIn order to solve the energy issue as soon as\npossible, we awakened Eternatus. But we\r\ncouldn’t control it.\c\nThe Champion came to aid me, even at the cost\nof abandoning the match.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Indeed, just like a knight in shining armor coming\nto rescue a princess from a dragon![VAR 0114(0006)]
I do tend to ramble on, I know.\nI love to make speeches.\r\nBut I think I can stop talking now.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I think the Champion should have captured\nEternatus by now.\c\nIf you’re curious, you can take the lift up.[VAR 0114(0006)]
And I trust you’ll be going too, right, Hop?\nI certainly hope losing to me didn’t discourage\r\nyou too much.\c\nGo on now, both of you! Go see how our\nChampion is doing![VAR 0114(0006)]
Discouraged...?\nYou don’t get it, do you, Chairman?\c\nNeither me nor my Pokémon are anywhere near\ngiving up!\c\nWe’ve learned how to be strong, thanks to the\nGym Challenge you organized![VAR 0114(0005)]
All right, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nI’m ready for anything. Are you?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Of course!
Give me a moment
Wouldn’t expect any less from my rival!\nNow, come on! We’ve got to help Lee![VAR 0114(0005)]
Yeah, we’ve no idea what’s going on up there.\nBetter be sure you’re really ready![VAR 0114(0005)]

But no need for you kids to worry.\c\nIt seems like some power of Eternatus’s\nwas keeping my team from Dynamaxing, but...\r\nwe’ve had a champion time all the same![VAR 0114(0004)]
Charizard and the rest of my champion team\nmembers have really worn Eternatus down.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Now if I can simply catch it in a Poké Ball,\nwe should be able to get this madness\r\nunder control.\r\nThen everything will be back to normal.\c\nSo watch this!\nIt’s going to be a real champion catch![VAR 0114(0004)]

He awoke Eternatus and nearly caused a\ncatastrophe for the entire region!\c\nYou reap what you sow, I say.
I don’t know about you, but I slept like the dead![VAR 0114(0005)]
Everyone’s still talking about what happened,\nbut at least things are back to normal now.\c\nWe really did defeat Eternatus together with\nZamazenta and Zacian![VAR 0114(0005)]

I do understand how he feels, though.\c\nFeels like I’ve been waiting forever to get to\nsee you and him face off in a serious match.[VAR 0114(0005)]

A real hero, who battled alongside the Legendary\nPokémon, Zacian and Zamazenta...\c\nI couldn’t have dreamed of a better challenger\nto help increase my winning streak![VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh...\nAnd you’ve even added Eternatus to your party.\c\nThe greatest challenger along with the most\npowerful Pokémon—is that it?\r\nNow you’re really getting me excited![VAR 0114(0004)]
Now that I’ve seen just what kind of strength\nyou possess as the greatest of challengers...\c\ncrushing you into the dirt will show everyone\njust how strong their Champion truly is![VAR 0114(0004)]

Huh? [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]?!\nWhat’re you doing here in the woods?[VAR 0114(0005)]
What about you?
The truth is...
Nobody ever comes in here, since this is the\nforest where Zacian and Zamazenta rested.\c\nIt’s the best place to do a bit of thinking, since\nit’s so quiet and all.[VAR 0114(0005)]
You say you felt like something was calling you\nhere, [VAR 0100(0000)]? That’s...\r\nMate, that’s pretty uncanny.[VAR 0114(0005)]
You say you felt like something was calling you\nhere? That’s...\r\nMate, that’s pretty uncanny.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ve been thinking, you know...\nMaybe the reason Zacian and Zamazenta chose\r\na place like this to sleep was because no one\r\never comes here and it’s so quiet all the time.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, but I hadn’t had the chance to tell you!\nCongrats on your victory, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Honestly, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nI never thought you’d manage to beat my brother.\c\nThe greatest Champion Galar ever had!\nHe was undefeatable till you came around![VAR 0114(0005)]

Oh, trying to act modest, are you?\nGo on—you’ve earned the right to be proud![VAR 0114(000B)]
What are you doing here?\nShouldn’t you be off assisting the professor?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hop, I’m actually not working as my gran’s\nassistant any longer...[VAR 0114(000B)]
In fact...\nI’m the professor now![VAR 0114(000B)]
Y-you are?![VAR 0114(0005)]
And really, I’ve got the two of you to thank\nfor that.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I was just along for the ride on your adventure,\nbut I ended up taking a real interest in the\r\nhistory of the Galar region.[VAR 0114(000B)]
And I came to care for Pokémon even more\nthan I ever had before![VAR 0114(000B)]
Ah, here! It’s a book I wrote!\nI even signed it—that makes it a collector’s item.[VAR 0114(000B)]

Anyway, I’ve got my gran’s blessing and put out\nmy first book under my own name...\c\nI think you can expect great things of the lovely\nProfessor Sonia in the future, wouldn’t you say?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Yeah, I expect so...\nSonia and [VAR 0100(0000)], you both amaze me!\r\nI’ve got a lot to live up to here![VAR 0114(0005)]
So? What are you young’ns doing here?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Er, oh, right...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Ohhh... That’s it, isn’t it?\c\nYou were putting the Rusted Sword and the\nRusted Shield back in their place?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Can’t just keep holding on to them forever, right?[VAR 0114(000B)]
We...were! Yeah, that’s what we were doing!\nWe were just about to do that.[VAR 0114(0005)]
You forgot entirely, didn’t you?\c\nWhat, you think the two of you are besties now\nwith Zacian and Zamazenta or something?![VAR 0114(000B)]
That must be it, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nWhy you felt like you were called here![VAR 0114(0005)]
Let’s put the sword and the shield back and say\na proper thanks for all the help.\c\nMaybe if we do, we’ll get to see Zacian and\nZamazenta again someday.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I don’t have the best memories of the Slumbering\nWeald, but I came to do a quick investigation.\c\nHurry it up, and put the Rusted Sword and the\nRusted Shield back where they belong!\r\nI’d like to get a photo of them on location.[VAR 0114(000B)]

Return the [VAR 0109(0001)]?
Zacian! Zamazenta!\nThanks loads for helping us out![VAR 0114(0005)]
Took us a little while, but we’ve brought back\nyour precious relics and all![VAR 0114(0005)]
You and Hop returned the Rusted Sword and\nRusted Shield!
All right! That about settles that.\n[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], why don’t you and I head back?[VAR 0114(0005)]
What’re you gonna do, Sonia?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I think I’ll stay here a bit longer. I want to do a\nlittle more research here in the forest.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Hm? My Power Spot Detector is going off...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Well, well, well... I thought I heard someone making\nsome noise over this way![VAR 0114(0042)]
Well, well, well... You wouldn’t be the Professor\nSonia who wrote the book “Galar: A History”?[VAR 0114(0042)]
Eh, ah, hello... You bought my book?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Why yes, of course! Read it from cover to cover![VAR 0114(0042)]
Why yes, of course! I even wrote an internet\nreview for it![VAR 0114(0042)]
That awful book was filled with lies...\nSo we gave it one star![VAR 0114(006A)]
What?! There are no lies printed in that book![VAR 0114(000B)]
That’s just plain rude![VAR 0114(0005)]
I am Sordward![VAR 0114(0068)]
I am Shielbert![VAR 0114(0069)]
We are the new kings of Galar!\nWe’re descendants of the first kings![VAR 0114(0068)]
More than that, we’re celebrities![VAR 0114(0069)]
New kings? Descendants?\nSeriously, what are you on about?[VAR 0114(0005)]
What exactly are you two supposed to be?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Well, well, well! Could these things here be the\nfabled sword and shield?[VAR 0114(0068)]
Well, well, well! They certainly are dirty! They must\nbe fake! I fear to touch them with my bare hands.[VAR 0114(0069)]
Sordward took the Rusted Sword!
Shielbert took the Rusted Shield!
Hey! Don’t go nicking those!\nWe just returned them![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, do shut up! We only happened to pick up\nsome things that were dropped on the ground![VAR 0114(0068)]
If you’ve got a problem with it, how about you\nprove to whom they belong, hmm?[VAR 0114(0069)]
But...there’s no way anyone can prove who those\nancient things belong to!\c\nEven if we can’t prove it, they’re really important\nto Zacian and Zamazenta![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh goodness. Such a plebeian, and yet so pushy.\nIf it’s really so important to you, perhaps we\r\nshould settle this with a battle?[VAR 0114(0068)]
We’re celebrities who buy battles for twice what\nthey’re worth![VAR 0114(0069)]
What does that even mean...?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I, the magnificent Sordward, am your opponent![VAR 0114(0068)]
I, the magnificent Shielbert, am your opponent![VAR 0114(0069)]
You took back the [VAR 0109(0001)]!
Tch! To somehow have defeated the adorable\nPokémon I go strolling with...\c\nYou’re certainly strong...[VAR 0114(0068)]
Tch! To somehow have defeated the adorable\nPokémon I go strolling with...\c\nYou’re certainly strong...[VAR 0114(0069)]
However, it appears that my younger brother\nwas victorious.[VAR 0114(0068)]
However, it appears that my older brother\nwas victorious.[VAR 0114(0069)]
Sorry, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nI lost to him...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Wahahahah! Something on your mind, boy?\nYou weren’t concentrating at all during\r\nour battle![VAR 0114(0069)]
Wahahahah! Something on your mind, boy?\nYou weren’t concentrating at all during\r\nour battle![VAR 0114(0068)]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Older Brother! Isn’t that the one who\nstopped Eternatus?[VAR 0114(0069)]
Younger Brother! Isn’t that the one who\nstopped Eternatus?[VAR 0114(0068)]
Oho! Now that I look closely, I believe it is!\c\nWhat a rude child, snatching up our chance at\nglory like that.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Oho! Now that I look closely, I believe it is!\c\nWhat a rude child, snatching up our chance at\nglory like that.[VAR 0114(0069)]
According to our sources...\c\nI believe [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she was also present during the\ndestruction of the magnificent mural our\r\nancestor so artfully created many years ago.[VAR 0114(0069)]
According to our sources...\c\nI believe [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she was also present during the\ndestruction of the magnificent mural our\r\nancestor so artfully created many years ago.[VAR 0114(0068)]
What a garish brute! Destroying the mural our\nfamily has held in such high esteem for so long?![VAR 0114(0068)]
What a garish brute! Destroying the mural our\nfamily has held in such high esteem for so long?![VAR 0114(0069)]
Mural? You mean the one that hid the historical\nruins of [VAR 0101(0001)] and the others?\c\nAnd hold on a moment—[VAR 0100(0000)] wasn’t\nthe one who destroyed it.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Let us withdraw for now... Next time we shall\nbring Pokémon that will utterly defeat you![VAR 0114(0069)]
Let us withdraw for now... Next time we shall\nbring Pokémon that will utterly defeat you![VAR 0114(0068)]
That’s right![VAR 0114(0068)]
Yes, let’s do that![VAR 0114(0069)]
And with that, farewell![VAR 0114(006A)]
W-wait! Stop!\nGive back that [VAR 0109(0001)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hold on, Hop![VAR 0114(000B)]
Ugh, that kid. He’s gone and recklessly run off...[VAR 0114(000B)]
At least you’re calm, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nI expected as much.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m surprised that Hop lost to someone like that.\c\nHe looked upset about something during the\nbattle. Maybe that had something to do with it?[VAR 0114(000B)]
His own rival became the new Champion, and his\ngoal vanished before his eyes...\c\nYou can’t help but wonder how he feels about\nit all.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Anyway! Sordward and Shielbert, was it? I think I\nmight know something about where those two\r\nweirdos went...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Shall we go over it at the lab in Wedgehurst?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Of course!
I’m worried about Hop
I bet I didn’t even need to ask! Thanks![VAR 0114(000B)]
I get it... You feel responsible for him and want\nto help him as soon as you can, right?[VAR 0114(000B)]
OK, we’ll meet up later, then! I’ll head back to\nthe lab.[VAR 0114(000B)]

Hm?
Professor Sonia, you have a visitor.
Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Glad you’re here.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Who’s this?
You got an assistant?
She’s my assistant! I’ve been so busy with\nresearch lately that I’ve had to bring on some\r\nextra help.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Spot on! I’ve been busy with my research, so I\ndecided to bring on some extra help.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ve been keeping all the Wishing Stars that\nChairman Rose had been gathering here in\r\nthe lab.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Things have been a little hectic around here, but\nmy assistant has been handling things in a proper\r\nfashion. She’s really been helping me keep\r\nthings afloat.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I really haven’t been doing all that much...
You’re [VAR 0100(0000)], the Champion, right?\c\nI’m really glad I get to meet you. It’s an\nhonor, truly.
Come here for a moment, would you? There’s\nsomething I want you to have a look at.[VAR 0114(000B)]
You remember my Power Spot Detector, right?\nIt detects places where Dynamaxing is possible...\c\nBasically when there’s a high concentration of\nGalar particles, the readings spike...[VAR 0114(000B)]
And that’s how I figured it out![VAR 0114(000B)]
The Power Spot Detector reacted when those\ntwo got close.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Could it be...?
So what does that mean?
Exactly![VAR 0114(000B)]
Basically...[VAR 0114(000B)]
follow the readings from the Power Spot\nDetector, and you might be able to find those\r\nsword and shield weirdos.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Sordward and Shielbert might claim to be royalty,\nwith their weird, fancy names. But it’s easier to\r\njust call them weirdos, don’t you think?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Let’s get back on topic, though![VAR 0114(000B)]
I placed Power Spot Detectors all around Galar,\nand now it’s their time to shine.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Power Spot Detectors—access![VAR 0114(000B)]
Whoa, whoa! That’s a way bigger reaction than I\nwould’ve thought! Looks like it’s coming from...\c\nTurffield Stadium?[VAR 0114(000B)]
You could always Dynamax Pokémon at the\nstadium, so that’s not exactly unusual.\r\nBut these readings are way higher than normal![VAR 0114(000B)]
It can’t be Eternatus... You already caught it.\nMaybe it’s something related to those sword and\r\nshield weirdos?[VAR 0114(000B)]
You should go check it out, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nSince you’re our snazzy new Champion and all![VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ve set up your Town Map to show where the\nstrong particle reactions are coming from, so\r\nhave a look at it.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ll leave looking into Turffield to you. I’ll stay\nhere and try to look into those rude weirdos.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m so glad to be working for Professor Sonia.\nTo have a doctorate at such a young age...\r\nShe’s really an amazing person.

Hm? You’re...[VAR 0114(0016)]
Hello there, Champion!\nSo, you came![VAR 0114(000E)]
What’s going on here?
It’s been a while
Hah! How carefree can you be?\c\nYou’re the new Champion. You’re bigger than a\nDynamax Pokémon right now.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I was actually in the middle of an exhibition\nmatch with Piers.\c\nThen this Dynamax Pokémon came charging in.[VAR 0114(000E)]
The audience and staff already took shelter.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Gyaaan!
I got everyone who was seated on the north side\nof the stadium evacuated!\c\nYou must’ve heard, right?\nMore Dynamax Pokémon are running amok![VAR 0114(0005)]
Much obliged, Hop!\c\nI’d expect nothing less from a Gym Challenger.\nI knew we could count on you.[VAR 0114(000E)]
I lost in the Semifinals, though...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Ah, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
I chased those red and blue guys and saw them\nhead into Turffield Stadium.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Then I heard that uproar, and there was no way\nI could leave it alone. I had to help out.[VAR 0114(0005)]
So, er... Sorry!\nI actually lost sight of them in all the rush.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hm. Those suspicious characters you saw\nare concerning...[VAR 0114(000E)]
But for now, I think we should get this Dynamax\nPokémon to settle down first![VAR 0114(000E)]
I’d be glad for your help against such a tough-\nlooking opponent, Champion [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000E)]
Of course!
Hold on a sec
All right. Then let’s head to the pitch.[VAR 0114(000E)]
I’ll lend a hand, too.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I don’t blame the Pokémon, of course, but I’m\nstill just a bit miffed they upstaged me.[VAR 0114(0016)]
You come too, bro of the old Champion.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I don’t know how much I can really help...[VAR 0114(0005)]
If I come along, I might just end up slowing the\nrest of you down...[VAR 0114(0005)]
I don’t really know the guy, but I don’t think\nLeon’d be all lost about this.\r\nThough he does get actually lost a lot...[VAR 0114(0016)]
You comin’?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Uh... OK![VAR 0114(0005)]
Piers might look scary, but he’s great at looking\nafter others. He’s a big brother, after all.[VAR 0114(000E)]
All right, we should get going, too.[VAR 0114(000E)]
OK! Preparation is as important as laying\nseeds for the next harvest.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Are you ready to battle the Dynamax Pokémon?[VAR 0114(000E)]
Usin’ Pokémon to ruin this stage...\nThe Trainers that did this ain’t gettin’ off\r\neasy if I find ’em.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I wonder if there’s anything more I can do?[VAR 0114(0005)]

Mugyuuu.
Milo used a Revive!
Shaaanari.
Phew... Looks like things’ve finally calmed down\na bit.[VAR 0114(000E)]
This Dynamax stuff... No matter how many times\nI see it, I still don’t like it.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I can see your dislike of Dynamaxing still hasn’t\nchanged, Piers.[VAR 0114(000E)]
But there was definitely something off about\nthat Dynamax transformation...[VAR 0114(000E)]
There wasn’t any Trainer anywhere!\c\nAnd the Pokémon seemed like it couldn’t even\ncontrol the power itself...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Quite right...\c\nNormally, a Pokémon needs to respond to a\nDynamax Band in order to Dynamax, but...[VAR 0114(000E)]
Seems there was some discord in the harmony\nbetween Trainer and Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Did you feel anything unusual, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000E)]
I did
I’m not sure
So you noticed something was off, too.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Hmm, well, I suppose it is a bit early to start\ndrawing any conclusions.[VAR 0114(000E)]
There’s no Trainer to be found. This really is a\nmystery wrapped in an enigma.[VAR 0114(000E)]
I’ll make sure Turffield Gym takes good care of\nthis Pokémon for the time being.[VAR 0114(000E)]
[~ 24]
You lot really helped me out here. Thanks\nfor that.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Oh, and [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nIf you should ever need my help, feel free to\ncall me anytime.[VAR 0114(000E)]
All right then. Follow me, little Tsareena.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Shaaanari.
Well, well, well! Looks like that Dynamax\nnonsense has calmed down.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Well, well, well. The Champion, as expected.[VAR 0114(0069)]
Ah! It’s you two! I knew you’d be here!\nGive the [VAR 0109(0001)] back![VAR 0114(0005)]
Well, I never. It’s not like it’s something that\nbelongs to you, either.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Even if it were yours, we wouldn’t give it back.[VAR 0114(0069)]
What’s with these two! Arrrghhh!\nGet over here so I can battle you![VAR 0114(0005)]
Who are these guys?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Spectators and staff should’ve been evacuated.[VAR 0114(0016)]
The normal rules simply just don’t apply to us![VAR 0114(0068)]
Yes! That’s what it means to be celebrities![VAR 0114(0069)]
What?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Who is this ruffian to question us? You’re just\nsomeone with strange taste in hairstyles![VAR 0114(0068)]
His entire style is complete black and white\nnonsense. Isn’t it, Older Brother?[VAR 0114(0069)]
You think I’d put any faith in words from rude\nlittle punks like you?[VAR 0114(0016)]
But it seems our experiment was a success,\nYounger Brother.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Quite, quite. Next time let us try to Dynamax\nan even stronger Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0069)]
Yes, yes! At last we shall reveal the true nature of\nZacian and Zamazenta![VAR 0114(0068)]
What was that about Zacian and Zamazenta?![VAR 0114(0005)]
You, despicable Champion! We’re going to keep\nletting Dynamax Pokémon run wild![VAR 0114(0069)]
If you want to stop us, do your best to chase\nafter our splendid-looking bottoms![VAR 0114(0068)]
More like...celebrity bottoms![VAR 0114(0069)]
And with that, farewell![VAR 0114(006A)]
So you were the ones who caused all this? Stop![VAR 0114(0005)]
Calm down, Hop. You don’t gotta act so hard.[VAR 0114(0016)]
B-but they’re getting away![VAR 0114(0005)]
Yeah, and they could be leadin’ us to a trap.\nIt’s a bad idea to run in unprepared.[VAR 0114(0016)]
But still![VAR 0114(0005)]
Ughhh... Fine.\nYou’re right. I get it.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Good. Let’s all calm down for a sec.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Thanks to them runnin’ their mouths, we know\ntheir goal is to force Pokémon to Dynamax.[VAR 0114(0016)]
And that they plan to continue doing it![VAR 0114(0005)]
I won’t allow it!
We have to stop them!
Yeah![VAR 0114(0005)]
This is no time to be hung up on getting back\nthe [VAR 0109(0001)]...\c\n[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! Piers!\nWe’ve got to stop those two![VAR 0114(0005)]
How’re those two makin’ Pokémon Dynamax\nwithout any Dynamax Bands?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Where would those red and blue buffoons have\ngone off to next?\c\nLet’s head out and look, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]

Ah, there you are, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Things are a\nright proper mess![VAR 0114(000B)]
Just when I thought the Galar particle count\naround Turffield had calmed down...[VAR 0114(000B)]
I started getting huge Galar particle readings\nfrom Hulbury Stadium and Motostoke Stadium![VAR 0114(000B)]
So, what exactly happened at Turffield Stadium?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Explain exactly what happened
Exaggerate what happened
What?! A Dynamax Pokémon went on\na rampage?[VAR 0114(000B)]
What?! A Dynamax Pokémon completely\ndestroyed the stadium?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Wait... Turffield Stadium is still there.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Huh? Those sword and shield weirdos did it?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh! Sonia![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hm? Hop and...Piers?![VAR 0114(000B)]
Piers, what are you doing here? Shouldn’t you be\nback in Spikemuth?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m an ex-Gym Leader. I can be wherever I want.\nIt’s not that weird![VAR 0114(0016)]
More importantly, you said there were Dynamax\nPokémon at other stadiums?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Yes. I’m getting the same readings in other towns\nas I was from Turffield Stadium.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m worried about Marnie![VAR 0114(0016)]
Ah, but Spikemuth Gym should be OK, right?\nI’m only seeing readings from Hulbury Stadium\r\nand Motostoke Stadium.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Ah... I see.[VAR 0114(0016)]
If Pokémon are being forced to Dynamax and\nrunning wild, there’s no way I can simply sit\r\nby and watch![VAR 0114(0005)]
What do you say, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Let’s head to one of the stadiums!
I want to chase after those two weirdos!
Heh. That’s the spirit, Champion.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Even if we wanna go after them, we don’t know\nwhere they went...[VAR 0114(0016)]
Leave those sword and shield weirdos to me.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I can poke around the net for sightings of them![VAR 0114(000B)]
We’ll leave the researchin’ to this, er... Sonia,\nwas it? We should get to the other stadiums\r\nand help out.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I’ll catch up to you in a bit, so head out first. I’ll\nleave it up to you to decide which stadium we\r\nhandle first.[VAR 0114(0016)]
If someone’s in trouble, then I want to help!\c\nSo, let’s get out there and do our best.\nAll right, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Those sword and shield weirdos stick out like a\nsore thumb. It shouldn’t be too hard to find them.\r\nTime for a little searching on social media![VAR 0114(000B)]

Don’t get too close, you lot! Things are pretty\ndangerous here![VAR 0114(000F)]
We know the situation. Are the staff and\nspectators all right?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Yes. They took shelter just a short while ago...[VAR 0114(000F)]
Y’know, the more I look at you three, the more I\nsee how odd a little group you are.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Tch. Leave us alone.[VAR 0114(0016)]
We came here to help you out.[VAR 0114(0005)]
And I’m grateful for it. That Dynamax Pokémon’s\npower is so intense I’m sure it’d give me trouble.[VAR 0114(000F)]
I’d feel a lot more confident about it if you all\njoined the battle.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Let’s do it![VAR 0114(000F)]

[~ 10]

Because of everyone’s help, no one was hurt and\nwe were able to turn the tide of the situation.[VAR 0114(000F)]
I’ll keep that Pokémon at Hulbury Stadium until\nit can fully recover.[VAR 0114(000F)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]... If you ever need my help, just\nlet me know.[VAR 0114(000F)]
I suppose I’ll see you later, then? Thank you so\nmuch for your help, truly.[VAR 0114(000F)]

Champion [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nAnd Piers and Hop, too![VAR 0114(0010)]
Mr. Kabu! I’m glad you remember me.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Of course I do!\c\nYou two were red-hot, after all! I’ll never\nforget seeing you off after you’d completed\r\nyour first leg of the Gym Challenge.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Oi, can we save the nostalgia for later?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Don’t think we really got the time for a\nfriendly chin-wag.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Right! Actually...the situation’s getting pretty\nbad over at the stadium.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Yeah. That’d be why we’re here.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Ah, brilliant! The opponent’s a bit much to\ntake on single-handedly, so I was wondering\r\nwhat to do.[VAR 0114(0010)]
But with you all at my side, my confidence in this\nbattle is burning brighter by the minute![VAR 0114(0010)]
Let’s begin![VAR 0114(0010)]
[~ 10]

[~ 12]
Looks like we were able to extinguish things\nthis time.[VAR 0114(0010)]
I’ll let this Pokémon rest here at Motostoke\nStadium until it gets its energy back.[VAR 0114(0010)]
And, [VAR 0100(0000)], should you have need of\nmy help, please do not hesitate to ask.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Don’t worry—I know... You all have more work\nthat needs to be done, yes?[VAR 0114(0010)]
Go forward, youths! I wish you well![VAR 0114(0010)]

*beep beep beep*
Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nThat your Rotom Phone ringing?[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! We’ve got trouble! Those two\nweirdos have showed up at the Pokémon Lab![VAR 0114(000B)]
What?! Sonia, you all right?![VAR 0114(0005)]
They keep rudely demanding I hand over\nWishing Stars. I’m all right for now, but get over\r\nhere quick, OK? These guys are right creepy![VAR 0114(000B)]
*beep*
What’re those two doin’ goin’ after\nWishing Stars?[VAR 0114(0016)]
We’ve got to help Sonia and get back\nthe [VAR 0109(0001)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Let’s hurry to the Pokémon Lab![VAR 0114(0005)]
He really doesn’t think anythin’ through...\nSure does make him seem a proper fool.\r\nNah, guess the word would be “reckless.”[VAR 0114(0016)]
We’re headed to the Pokémon Lab next, right?\nGuess I’ll stick by you till we see this through.[VAR 0114(0016)]

We know all the Wishing Stars that Chairman\nRose had gathered are here. We celebrities have\r\nan enhanced level of insight into such things![VAR 0114(0068)]
You noncelebrities are not suited to having\nsuch valuable things. Hand them over to us.[VAR 0114(0069)]
Wishing Stars and being a celebrity have nothing\nto do with each other![VAR 0114(000B)]
I don’t know how you knew about this, but\nthere’s no way we’re giving them to you![VAR 0114(000B)]
That’s right! You could never understand how\nimportant these Wishing Stars are. You have\r\nno need for them![VAR 0114(000A)]
Goodness. Whatever should we do,\nYounger Brother?[VAR 0114(0068)]
It would certainly seem we have been\ninconvenienced, Older Brother.[VAR 0114(0069)]
Wahahahah!
Sonia and the professor are the ones who’ve\nbeen inconvenienced here![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hop![VAR 0114(000B)]
Forcing Pokémon to Dynamax against their will...\nYou’ve gone way out of bounds here![VAR 0114(0005)]
And I haven’t forgot about getting back the\n[VAR 0109(0001)], either![VAR 0114(0005)]
Well, well, well! I certainly thought the Champion\nwould come, but I didn’t think a loser\r\nwould follow.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Must I have you once again taste the flavor of a\nhumiliating defeat?[VAR 0114(0069)]
Rrrghhh![VAR 0114(0005)]
Don’t let these goons put you down![VAR 0114(000B)]
That’s right![VAR 0114(0016)]
You lost a battle, but don’t lose that rockin’ spirit![VAR 0114(0016)]
R-right...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Steady on
We’ll fight them together
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]...\nThanks, mate![VAR 0114(0005)]
First thing’s first!\nLet’s get these weirdos out of here![VAR 0114(0005)]
W— W-w-w...\nW-w-w...WEIRDOS?[VAR 0114(0068)]
Oh, how they wound me, Older Brother!\nTo be called so terrible a thing as “weirdos” by\r\nthese ruffians![VAR 0114(0069)]
Indeed! To address royals such as ourselves in\nsuch a manner cannot—will not—be forgiven![VAR 0114(0068)]
This time I’ve brought much stronger Pokémon to\nthoroughly trounce you with![VAR 0114(0069)]
I did it...\nWe won! We really won![VAR 0114(0005)]
The exquisite Pokémon we trained actually lost?![VAR 0114(0068)]
Harumph! You only won because you two teamed\nup. Still, we offer you ruffians our praise.[VAR 0114(0069)]
Oi. The two of you teamed up, too.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Give back the [VAR 0109(0001)], and\nstop forcing Pokémon to go all crazy![VAR 0114(0005)]
Ah, sorry... Is this a bad time?
My apologies for the intrusion.
Those men are dangerous! Be careful![VAR 0114(000B)]
... ... ...
Well done. Your infiltration mission was a\nresounding success, it seems.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Have you gathered the Wishing Stars?[VAR 0114(0069)]
Yes, thanks to Masters Sordward and Shielbert\nbuying me so much time.
The assistant handed the Wishing Stars over to\nSordward and Shielbert!
What? Stop! Give back those Wishing Stars![VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh dear... It would seem we’ve been\ncompletely had.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Fwaheeheehoho! Why, this moment is so sweet,\nI don’t think I’ll need any sugar in my tea later![VAR 0114(0068)]
Our battle with you was just a little trick! We’d\nwon before you’d grabbed a single Poké Ball![VAR 0114(0069)]
And with that, farewell!
Stop![VAR 0114(0005)]
Why?![VAR 0114(000B)]
Professor Sonia...I’m sorry.
Was everything... Was it all a lie, right from\nthe start?[VAR 0114(000B)]
There was no helping it. It was necessary for\nthe plan.
Our plan to put Galar under the control of the\nroyal lineage once again...
... ... ...[VAR 0114(000B)]
I think she’s gonna need some cheerin’ from her\nreal friends.[VAR 0114(0016)]
So those two weren’t working alone?\c\nOne of their followers even betrayed Sonia...\nThat’s real rough...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Seems that lot did have something to back up all\ntheir big talk...[VAR 0114(000A)]

Wait! Don’t just leave without saying anything![VAR 0114(000B)]
But...you were upset.\nWe didn’t want to say anything to make it worse.[VAR 0114(0005)]
We were tryin’ to be considerate, but...[VAR 0114(0016)]
Of course I’d be down on myself! It was my fault\nI got tricked by a Nickit in Wooloo’s clothing.[VAR 0114(000B)]
But that’s it! No more feeling sorry for myself![VAR 0114(000B)]
That lot made off like bandits with all the\nWishing Stars![VAR 0114(000B)]
It’d be awful if they were used for some evil\npurpose, so there’s no time to be feeling down![VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh![VAR 0114(0005)]
Heh. Hehehe... You’ve got some guts.[VAR 0114(0016)]
You’ve certainly grown strong in the face of\nadversity, dearie.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Gran...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Dynamaxing draws out the true strength from the\ntrust between a Pokémon and their Trainer.[VAR 0114(000A)]
But that group is likely pouring the Galar\nparticles emitted by the Wishing Stars into\r\nPokémon, forcing them to Dynamax.[VAR 0114(000A)]
That’s awful!
That would explain the theft...
Indeed. What an awful thing to do to Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0016)]
As expected of the Champion. Your intuition is\nquite sharp, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000A)]
The theft of the Wishing Stars was just the start.\nThings could get a lot worse from here on.[VAR 0114(000A)]
But why? What reason could they have for\nforcing Pokémon to Dynamax?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Those weirdos said that they wanted to reveal\nthe true natures of Zacian and Zamazenta.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m curious about what my former assistant said\nabout a royal lineage.\c\nDid she mean it literally?[VAR 0114(000B)]
...Ah! [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! Look at your Town Map![VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m detecting huge reactions at four\nstadiums now![VAR 0114(000B)]
They certainly get around, don’t they?[VAR 0114(000A)]
If there’s trouble at the stadiums, then Marnie\ncould be in a real bad way![VAR 0114(0016)]
Ah, Spikemuth seems to be OK. There’s no\nPower Spot stadium there...[VAR 0114(000B)]
*ahem*\nRighto...[VAR 0114(0016)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]!\nThis is no time to be lying about![VAR 0114(0005)]
If Pokémon are in trouble, why’re we still here?!\nLet’s get right out there to lend a hand![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m sorry to leave it all to you, but you’ll have to\ntake care of the Dynamax Pokémon.\c\nI’ll search for those sword and shield weirdos in\nthe meantime![VAR 0114(000B)]
Wishing Stars were one component of the\nDarkest Day...\c\nIf they have that many, they could cause\nPokémon to Dynamax like Eternatus did.[VAR 0114(000A)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_3100

Nice timing, you lot![VAR 0114(0017)]
The stadium’s just about reached its limit!\c\nThere’re simply too many Dynamax Pokémon\nrunning wild in there![VAR 0114(0017)]
Seems Wishing Star power is bein’ used for\nsome evil purpose.[VAR 0114(0016)]
So that’s what’s caused all this?\nThat’s a problem, all right...\c\nBut before we get that sorted, we’ve got to do\nsomething about these Dynamax Pokémon![VAR 0114(0017)]
Glad we’ve got you all here now.\nThough we’ve already done the bulk of the work![VAR 0114(0017)]
We’re here to help, too!\nRight, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Leave it to us!
We’ll take care of this!
Especially you, Piers!\nThe way you battled me in the Champion Cup...\c\nYou really had my Dynamax Pokémon up against\nthe wall![VAR 0114(0017)]
Things might actually go better this time if we\nsplit up our little band.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Fantastic! Looks like we’ve got ourselves together\nan unbeatable team![VAR 0114(0017)]
Right! Everyone, split up so we can each take\ndown one of the Dynamax Pokémon! Let’s do it![VAR 0114(0017)]
[~ 12]

You guys are the greatest!\nYou really got me out of a tough spot here!\c\nI think I’d better snap a quick one to remember\nthis victory by.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I’ll take care of the Pokémon that went wild.\nNo need for you all to worry about that.[VAR 0114(0017)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]!\nGive me a ring if things should go to pot again.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I’m always happy to lend a hand if I can.\nThe great Raihan is here for you anytime![VAR 0114(0017)]
And Piers! You and I have got to battle again.\nThis time, no Dynamaxing for either of us![VAR 0114(0017)]
Wishing Stars being used for evil...\c\nI assume you all are already looking into who’s\nbehind it, right?\c\nCarry on, then. I’ll take care of things here at\nHammerlocke Stadium![VAR 0114(0017)]

You all!\nDid you come to lend us a hand?[VAR 0114(0011)]
...Oh. You.\nYou came to help me?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Eh, somethin’ like that. How’re things lookin’?[VAR 0114(0016)]
We just finished getting everyone to safety, so\nI was about to challenge the Dynamax Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0011)]
The people all got out...\c\nBut I’m the Gym Leader...\nI’ll...battle the Dynamax Pokémon![VAR 0114(0012)]
[~ 5]
[~ 6]
Nice one! Then let’s all work together![VAR 0114(0005)]
I give you my most heartfelt thanks![VAR 0114(0011)]
That’d...\nThat’d be brilliant, thanks![VAR 0114(0012)]
We’ve got several opponents, so we may as well\ntake one each.\c\nI’ll be counting on you all![VAR 0114(0011)]
There are loads of ’em...\nI hope everyone...can take one each. Please![VAR 0114(0012)]
Here we go![VAR 0114(0011)]
...Let’s go![VAR 0114(0012)]
[~ 14]
[~ 15]
[~ 16]
I can’t thank you all enough.\c\nWith your help, the Dynamax Pokémon have all\nbeen returned to normal.[VAR 0114(0011)]
...Th-thanks. A lot.\c\nThe Pokémon have all calmed down...[VAR 0114(0012)]
I’ll keep them safe here in the stadium, so no\nneed to worry.[VAR 0114(0011)]
They can rest here...\nThey...should be fine in time...[VAR 0114(0012)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nNext time I’ll be the one who saves you in your\nhour of need. Give me a call if you’re ever in a\r\nrough spot.[VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]...\nHere... My League Card.[VAR 0114(0012)]
If there are other places that need a Champion’s\nhelp, please go look after them![VAR 0114(0011)]
...Y-you can leave things here to me.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I’ll protect the peace of Stow-on-Side Stadium\nwith all my might![VAR 0114(0011)]
...I-I’d rather you go help those who need you![VAR 0114(0012)]

Hmph. You lot.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Bede?! What about the Dynamax Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0005)]
You think I, the elite Fairy-type Gym Leader,\nwould have any kind of trouble?[VAR 0114(000C)]
That’s right—you’re a Gym Leader now!\nThough I don’t know about “elite” or whatever.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Please...please don’t tell me you came\nhere to help?\c\nFirst of all, you’re a bit late to be of any use,\nand second, I didn’t need any help.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Why’d I know you’d say something like that...?\nWe came all the way out here just to lend a hand![VAR 0114(0005)]
What an obnoxious Gym Leader. The next Gym\nChallenge is shapin’ up to really be somethin’.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Oleana tricked and used me...\nFrom now on, only I decide how I live![VAR 0114(000C)]
And I think what I should do now is have a battle\nwith you, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000C)]
Look, I’m sorry, mate, but...\nthis is hardly the time![VAR 0114(0005)]
Don’t always be in such a hurry, boy.\nYou aced my quiz, so show a little composure.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Bede has already quieted three Dynamax Pokémon.\nHe’s given you the luxury of some extra time.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Bede’s life won’t be bound by what other people\nsay any longer.\c\nAlthough I certainly influenced a few of his\ndecisions not too long ago.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Now that you mention it...I suppose you did.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Yeah, yeah. As expected of a wise 88-year-old\ngranny, I guess.[VAR 0114(0016)]
But this has nothing to do with Ms. Opal.\nThis battle’s for me!\c\nNow, don’t dillydally!\nYour only option is to accept![VAR 0114(000C)]
I’ll battle you
I understand!
My Pokémon and I have risen from the ashes...\nI’ll grant you a brief glimpse at how amazing\r\nwe’ve become.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Thank you for the battle.\c\nI can now accept you as the Champion.[VAR 0114(000C)]
It’s painful to admit, but I’ve come to realize a\nfew of my weaknesses.[VAR 0114(000C)]
But I’ll keep getting stronger. I’ll reach the\npinnacle of what Fairy types can do.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Now then, as the Gym Leader, I will do my duty\nand clean the stadium.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Now, that’s what I would call a perfectly pink\nPokémon battle![VAR 0114(0013)]
Even after losing his right to participate in the\nGym Challenge, Bede still found his own way to\r\ncrash the Champion Cup...\c\nYeah, I’d say he’s a force to be reckoned with.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I think I get why he was chosen to be the next\nGym Leader.[VAR 0114(0005)]
He might be unbearable at times—or really, most\nall the time—but he’s a fierce Trainer.[VAR 0114(0005)]
He takes things seriously
He’s really strong
Yeah. Watching him battle you, it was plain to\nsee how much work he puts into it.[VAR 0114(0005)]
He’s strong enough that even a Champion like\nyou recognizes it, eh?[VAR 0114(0005)]
If you both are gonna keep talkin’, how ’bout I\nfetch you a nice cuppa?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Right, right, I hear you!\nAnd I won’t be outdone by that Bede or anyone!\r\nOn to the next one![VAR 0114(0005)]

Who d’you think you’re talkin’ to, then?\nWe’re here to help, not be helped.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Oh, actually...\nI didn’t realize who I was talking to.[VAR 0114(0014)]

[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]’s here, so everyone can relax![VAR 0114(0005)]
I was just thinking over how to handle all the\nDynamax Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0014)]
There appear to be no less than four Dynamax\nPokémon. I was just going over a plan on how\r\nto handle things.[VAR 0114(0015)]
With all of you here, we can each take one of\nthem on![VAR 0114(0014)]
With all these strong Trainers together, I’m sure\nwe can work something out here![VAR 0114(0015)]
Let’s hurry to the pitch.[VAR 0114(0014)]

Nice work, everyone. No one’s hurt, are they?[VAR 0114(0014)]
Phew! Is everyone feeling all right?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Hah...hah... Just barely![VAR 0114(0005)]
Battling a Dynamax Pokémon all on your own is\npretty hard work![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hehe. I expected nothing less from you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]. You seem like quite the\r\nreliable Trainer, too, Hop.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Ohoho! Of course you had no problem,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]! You really seem like a reliable\r\nTrainer, too, Hop![VAR 0114(0015)]
I...I do?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Looks like he ain’t used to compliments. Look,\nhe’s got a grin wider than a Meowth.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I do not!\nShut your gob, Piers![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll take care of the Pokémon we battled, so\nthere’s no need for any of you to worry, all right?[VAR 0114(0014)]
I’ll take care of the Pokémon we battled.\nNo need for anyone to worry.[VAR 0114(0015)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]. It’s hardly a reward for what\nyou’ve done for me, but please take a copy of\r\nmy League Card.[VAR 0114(0014)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]. It’s not much of a reward,\nbut have a copy of my League Card.[VAR 0114(0015)]
If anything comes up, please contact me.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Give me a call if anything happens![VAR 0114(0015)]
All right then. I wish you all the best of luck for\nthe future![VAR 0114(0014)]

So the reason those red and blue buffoons\ncould make so many Pokémon Dynamax was\r\nbecause they hoarded up so many Wishing Stars...[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nWe’ve got to go help all the other places where\nthese Dynamax Pokémon are running wild![VAR 0114(0005)]
Looks like most of the stadiums have got this\nDynamax problem sorted now.\c\nLet’s keep up the pace, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Right! I think that’s all the stadiums sorted now!\nWe didn’t miss any, did we, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]

Things’ll probably get even tougher from here.\nWe still got three more stadiums where there’s\r\nsome Dynamax Pokémon runnin’ wild.\c\nLet’s up the tempo.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Looks like there’s two Pokémon Stadiums left\nto check.[VAR 0114(0016)]
There’s only one Pokémon Stadium with\nDynamax trouble left. Let’s finish this already.[VAR 0114(0016)]
All that’s left is to catch those sword and\nshield weirdos.[VAR 0114(0016)]
If we don’t find them quick, they could just start\nall this up again![VAR 0114(0005)]
Wasn’t Professor Sonia s’pposed to be\nlookin’ into where those two might be?[VAR 0114(0016)]
And once we find them again, I’m going to take\nthem right down![VAR 0114(0005)]
*beep beep beep*
That’s your Rotom Phone, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nIt’s got to be Sonia![VAR 0114(0005)]

Heh! Called it.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Those sword and shield weirdos got into\nHammerlocke Stadium and are headed\r\nfor the Energy Plant.[VAR 0114(000B)]
The door to the plant’s locked, but I think I can\nget it open. Give me a bit, and you’ll be able to\r\nget in there![VAR 0114(000B)]
You hear that? Hammerlocke Stadium. Get over\nthere as soon as you can![VAR 0114(000B)]
Even over the phone, Sonia sure sounds lively...[VAR 0114(0005)]
We should hurry to Hammerlocke Stadium.[VAR 0114(0016)]

But the door’s closed with an electric lock.\nOpening it might take some time...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Bow wark!
I’ll work on getting the door to the roof open.\nCan you take care of what’s going on in the\r\nstadiums, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Wha—? You’re back already? Hold on a moment!\nI think I’ve almost got it... Huh? That’s strange...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Yamp! Yamp!
What?! It...it opened?![VAR 0114(000B)]
Yamper! I should’ve known! Thanks for your help![VAR 0114(000B)]
Nuphunnn!

I want to be someone who can help out Pokémon\nthat’re in trouble, wherever they are...\r\nI think I want to become a Pokémon Professor![VAR 0114(0005)]
I started thinking I might when we were going\naround to all the stadiums to help the Pokémon\r\nthat were running out of control.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I know I don’t know enough about Pokémon yet,\nand I’ve got no experience for this sort of thing,\r\nbut I’m gonna study and learn a whole lot![VAR 0114(0005)]
And someday I’ll become the sort of professor\nthat you, [VAR 0100(0000)], and you, Sonia...\r\nwell, the sort you would be proud to know![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m gonna take a different path than you and\nLee are taking, [VAR 0100(0000)]...but...\r\nI’ll still always think of you as my true rival![VAR 0114(0005)]
There’s nothing I’d like better!

Say, Hop. Fancy becoming my assistant at\nthe lab?[VAR 0114(000B)]
What?![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ve got all the books and data on Pokémon you\ncould ever want![VAR 0114(000B)]
Since you want to be a professor someday, I’ll\noversee your studies![VAR 0114(000B)]
Then I definitely want to!\nOnly...you sure I can really be any help to you?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Of course! Mind you, it’ll be a lot of work.\nWork’s really been piling up since I lost my\r\nfirst assistant![VAR 0114(000B)]
Wait! So what you really mean is you’re offering\nme the position to help yourself out?\r\nAh, fine! I’ll still do a bang-up job![VAR 0114(0005)]
You’ll have my back, too—right, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, and...here, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nYou should take this![VAR 0114(0005)]

Huh?! Sordward and Shielbert...with Piers?\nAnd even Lee?![VAR 0114(0005)]

Rotom colors
[VAR 0103(0004)]-type color
[VAR 0103(0005)]-type color
Never mind
How about the [VAR 0103(0004)]-type color?\nIt would match your [VAR 0101(0006)] nicely!
Which color do you think would match your\n[VAR 0101(0006)] best?
Would you like to use one of these colors to\nmatch your [VAR 0101(0006)]?
Would you like to use one of these colors to\nmatch your [VAR 0101(0006)]?
Is the [VAR 0103(0004)]-type color what you want?
Actually, never mind
Jolly good. Jolly good indeed!\nYou’ve picked a wonderful color!
Hold on now. That’s the same color it is now!\nI’d hardly call that a color change!

Why, you’ve achieved the newest high score!\nCongratulations! That’s very impressive!
You obtained [VAR 1302(0002,0000)][VAR FF00(0008)][VAR 0109(0002)][VAR FF00(0000)]!

Ah, too bad... You’ve run out of time!\nBut I trust you’ll be back again for another try!
Splendid! That’s the first Rotom Rally you’ve\nsuccessfully completed!\r\nHere’s a little souvenir for the occasion!
Amazing! You’ve earned over [VAR 0204(0001,002C)] points!\nHere’s a little souvenir for the occasion!
Thank you so much for participating in the\nRotom Rally! Here’s a little souvenir for\r\nyou, as a sign of my gratitude!
If you let me give your bike some extra power,\nI can make it charge up the turbo boost faster!\r\nIt’ll cost you [VAR 0205(0000,002C)] W, though. Is that OK?
If you let me give your bike more power,\nI can help the turbo boost charge up even faster!\r\nIt’ll cost you [VAR 0205(0000,002C)] W, though. Is that OK?
If you let me give your bike even more power,\nI can increase its turbo-boost charge speed to\r\nthe maximum! It’ll cost you [VAR 0205(0000,002C)] W,\r\nthough. Is that OK?
All right, your bike has extra power!\nSince your turbo boost charges faster now, why\r\nnot have another go at the Rotom Rally?
All right, your bike has extra power!\nSince your turbo boost charges faster now, why\r\nnot have another go at the Rotom Rally?

Stopper message (TBD)
At last, the Gym Challenge’s opening ceremony!\nMy heart is pounding with all the excitement!
Corrr!
Motostoke is something else!\c\nWhat other city has a lift to take you between\nthe upper and the lower districts?
The eight Gym Leaders that challengers have\nto face...\c\nThey’re all frightfully strong. I wonder if any of\nthe Gym Challengers stand a chance.
[~ 5]
No wandering into that tall grass for you if\nyou’ve got no Pokémon of your own, mate![VAR 0114(0005)]
You can’t go any farther in with that Wooloo\nstanding in the way!
And where do you think you’re off to, then?\nWe’re having a battle—you and me![VAR 0114(0005)]
Be serious, would you?\nWe’ve got to go look for that Pokémon![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 10]
[~ 11]
Sorry, but Team Yell caused quite the kerfuffle,\nand now the bridge is in a bit of a state...\c\nWe’ll have things cleaned quick as can be done,\nbut could you give us some time?
If you’re looking for your Bag, [VAR 0100(0000)],\ndidn’t you leave it in your room?\r\nAnd grab yourself a hat for the weather, as well![VAR 0114(0008)]
Heya, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nHop was looking for you, you know.\c\nBut no need to go to the next town to find him\nwhen he lives right next door, right?
[~ 15]
You did tell your mum that we’re heading to\nWedgehurst, right?\r\nShe’ll go spare if you disappear without a word.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Mzzz... Mzzz...
You wouldn’t want to wake up the sweet sleeping\nWooloo, right? Better to take the long way round.
Let’s go and meet Lee at the station!\nIt’s dead ahead from here![VAR 0114(0005)]
My Wooloo simply loves the Pokémon Center.\c\nCome along, Wooloo!\nYou’re perfectly healed! Time we go back home!
Meeeeeeh...
I lost to the Trainers out training their\nteams on Route 2... I just can’t believe it...\c\nGive me a moment to process, would you?\nI’m in shock here.
The Slumbering Weald is over this way!\nLet’s go find that Wooloo![VAR 0114(0005)]
I believe the chairman was quite clear.\nGet your Water Badge at once.[VAR 0114(0007)]
You must be a Gym Challenger, right?\c\nIf you’re looking for the Gym Leader, Nessa,\nshe’s off at the lighthouse.\c\nThe lighthouse is, well... If you head toward the\nsea from here, you shouldn’t be able to miss it.
We’re blockin’ off this route to get in the way\nof Gym Challengers—you got that?\c\n“Our Marnie’s all done with Hulbury!\nOur Marnie’s all done with the sea!\r\nOur Marnie defeats every leader,\r\nand she’ll bring us all sweet victory!”
Team Yell’s hard at work trainin’ up our Pokémon\nt’be extra hard here in Galar Mine No. 2!
Can’t you see we’re practicin’ our chants here?!\c\n“You’re not passin’!\nYou’re not passin’!\r\nYou’re not passin’, not through here!\r\nYou’ll not get through till we’re all done here!”
Can’t you see we’re practicin’ our cheers here?!\n“M-A-R-N-I-and-E! That’s how we spell victory!”
You just can’t silence Team Yell!\c\n“She’s cute! She’s tough!\nShe won’t take no one’s guff!\r\nOoour Marnie! She’s our Marnie!”
You just can’t silence Team Yell!\c\n“Glory, glory, to our Marnie!\nGlory, glory, to our Marnie!\r\nGlory, glory, to our Marnie!\r\nAs our girl goes marchin’ on!”
Excuse me! You need permission to enter the\nvault here in Hammerlocke!
You can’t drown us out, mate!\nWe’ll just turn the volume up!\c\n“M-A-R N-I-E!\nThat spells victory to me!\r\nWith the knick-knack paddywhack,\r\ngive Growlithe a bone...\r\nMarnie’s gonna send you home!”
[~ 34]
Corviknight is a Pokémon that flies all about\ncarrying people where they want to go.\r\nBut even they get tuckered out...
Hmm? You don’t have the Fire Badge yet.\c\nYou can’t enter without the Fire Badge.\nWould you like me to take you back to the\r\nbridge at the Motostoke Riverbank?
Got it! Then come with me!
Got it! Well, don’t push yourself too hard.\nSet up camp or something when you need a rest!
My Corviknight got all rested up, so it’s already\nheaded off on its next Poké Job!

It’s a mailbox that Pokémon collect letters from!
There are so many books!\c\nThe ad says the magazine with a special feature\non all the Gym Leaders is the most popular.
It’s a record shop.\nApparently you can find some rare records here.
[~ 22]
[~ 23]
[~ 24]
[~ 25]
This city is just massive!\c\nI need to keep checking my Town Map,\notherwise I know I’ll get lost!
Here in the Galar region, I’d say it’s fair to call\nthe Champion a regional hero.\c\nWe’re all transfixed by everything he does!
You gotta throw Poké Balls!\c\nThrow them over and over to get your pitching\ntechnique sorted!
Leon throws his Poké Balls with so much energy!\nI wonder if the Pokémon inside get dizzy?
Churu churu.
[~ 31]
It’s wonderful that there’s space for Steenee to\nrelax and enjoy itself.\c\nIn fact, I’m tempted to join it and quench my\nthirst, too!
We use the Pokémon move Growth to raise our\nflowers, so they get rather large!
I always bring flowers home—on special days or\neven normal days.\c\nMy Pokémon loves the scent of flowers so much.
I love flower Pokémon!
Shrinking down to fit in Poké Balls, and the next\nthing you know, growing massive by Dynamaxing...\c\nIt must be a lot of work for Pokémon!
Minci minci minci!
Minccino likes things neat and tidy.\nIt’ll brush away any dust with its tail!
I see that you’re working on a Pokédex!\c\nYou’ll meet lots of different Pokémon if you head\nto the Wild Area.
There’s something satisfying about actually being\nable to hold the products when you shop.\c\nThen again, buying things online and having\nPokémon deliver them to you has its own charm.
You can really tell a person’s character by\ngoing shopping with them.\c\nMy husband...well...he doesn’t think too much\nabout what he buys.
Grrrarock!
Onix is big, but it can get even bigger\nby Dynamaxing!
Howzit? I came all the way from Alola\nto watch the Gym Challenge in person!
If I could choose my own uniform number, which\none should I pick? I can’t make up my mind!
I can’t wear the same uniform as my favorite\nGym Leader. I’d get way too nervous.
Records truly are amazing.\c\nThey bring life back to singers who no longer\ncan sing...
Mr. Rose has a real love for the Galar region.\c\nIt’s not enough to help keep us all supplied with\nenergy—he even supports the Gym Challenge!
Steam power’s amazing!\nIt can even move that giant lift!
I’m always frightened by airplanes and whatnot...\nHow those giant chunks of metal move so fast.\c\nPokémon don’t bother me, though.
I never get tired of watching those giant,\nsteam-powered gears turning!
My Toxel likes tinned food way too much.
There are some Pokémon that just love to battle.\nI guess there’s lots of different ways to live\r\nwith Pokémon!
It’s fun playing with Mandibuzz, but really I wish\nI could fly with it!
Buafuah!
Poen poen.
Come on now, Tympole.\nTime to head home.
In the Galar region, it’s only natural that\nwe help each other out.\r\nThe cleaning I do is just volunteer work!
Even if there’s no point in having a chin-wag, it’s\nstill great to hear the voice of someone you like!
People can change whenever they want—they\njust need to want to change...\r\nMaybe this old man can make a change, too.
Pokémon need PP, or Power Points, to\nperform moves!
It’s fine and dandy to have battles in the city,\nbut you need to make sure you don’t get in\r\nanyone’s way!
I’m playing hopscotch with Wynaut and my\nyounger sister!\c\nDo you know hopscotch? You have to jump\nyour way through the court!
We can play with our Pokémon here!
Wy wynaut.
Once I get my new hairstyle, I’m going to stop by\nthe Rotomi at the Pokémon Center to update my\r\nLeague Card!
I do my best every day and cheer on my favorite\nGym Leaders...\c\nYou really don’t get tired of doing the things\nyou love!
Some people say they like Pokémon because of\nhow strong they are, but I think that their\r\ncuteness is part of their appeal, too!
The Gym Challenge is a journey, you know.\c\nYou travel throughout the region, together with\nyour Pokémon.\c\nRemember, if you were able to take the first step,\nthe second step is never quite as hard.
I know old folks like us can get carried away\noffering advice, but the most important thing for\r\nyoung ones like you is to live the way you want.
Mworp!
Well? What do you think about our secret hideout?\nWe want to make a new Gym!
I bet we would make it the best Gym in Galar\nin like two years!
The Gym Leaders battle each other separately\nfrom the Gym Challenge in order to determine\r\nwho is stronger.
Don’t you wish people could use Pokémon\nmoves, too?\c\nI mean, I bet I could unleash an amazing\nHyper Beam!
Most of the companies here in Galar are owned\nby Chairman Rose!
My favorite person is the Champion!\nMy favorite word is “strongest”!
Ah, Motostoke Stadium!\nThis is where the opening ceremony is held!\r\nExhibition matches are super exciting, too!
You’re participating in the Gym Challenge?\nI bet you have some dependable Pokémon, then.
You’ve got the Fire Badge!\nThat’s wicked, mate!
The Gym Leaders will show up for the\nGym Challenge opening ceremony.
You’re a challenger, right?\nDon’t let those Gym Leaders beat you!
I was watching your match!\c\nI literally shouted with excitement when you\ndefeated Kabu!
The stadium is so huge!\nI wonder how many houses would fit inside?
The stadium can even handle\nDynamax Pokémon battling inside!\c\nIt is said that long, long ago there was a giant\nstadium made entirely out of stone.
[~ 86]
I feel like that challenger named Bede has\nsome potential!\r\nI bet he’ll pull off something incredible!
My favorite is Leon’s Charizard!
Everyone participating in the Gym Challenge\nis welcome to stay at the Budew Drop Inn.
We League staff are here to provide support\nfor the various matches that occur throughout\r\nthe Gym Challenge.
Go, Gym Challenger!\nLooking forward to it!
Do your best!
I’m cheering for you!
Give it your best shot!
Yeah!\nSo cool!
Go! Go all the way!\nJust keep going!
Oh! You’re that challenger\neveryone’s talking about.
You’re gonna face Kabu?\nWell, good luck!
Kabu’s a strong Trainer.\nThat’s for sure!
Go all out!
All the Gym Leaders...\nright here!
You’re an amazing Trainer,\ndefeating Kabu and all!
[~ 103]
Great weather, eh, mate?
I can’t believe Kabu lost!\nWhat a match!
Hey, Champion!\nThanks for everything!
Good day to you!
Hey there!\nThat was a good match!
I heard Kabu’s training his\nteam all over again.
Something good happen?
I wish something good\nwould happen.
Guess I should go look for\nsomething good.
That meal was a delight!
Time for some Max Raid\nBattles in the Wild Area!
I can’t find the TR that I\nreally want...
The Gym Challenge!\nThe Gym Challenge!
I want to battle Leon!
Where’d Leon go?
Cooking while camping is\njust fantastic!
Curry’s kind of like\nstew, right?
I hear curry’s really popular\nin places like Kanto.
It’s so soothing to see\nPokémon playing in the city.
My hobby’s going camping\nand playing with Pokémon!
I bet I could become a\ncamping master!
Oh! You’re the Gym\nChallenger I’m cheering for!
I’m gonna buy the uniform\nof my favorite Gym Leader!
Your uniform number is\nsuper popular!
Pardon.
Yeah, that makes sense.
That’s about right.
Speed is important!\nIt lets you attack first!
TMs are great!\nThey never break!
The Rotom Rally!\nThe Rotom Rally!
Poké Balls!\nGreat Balls!
Ultra Balls are ultra-great!
Master Balls are a sure catch!
Dynamaxing makes your\nPokémon become huge!
Gigantamaxing changes your\nPokémon’s look!
You can win a Master Ball\nthrough the Loto-ID.
Mworp!
Bworp!

Have you visited Hammerlocke Stadium yet?\nIt looks super rugged!
I’ve been told that Hammerlocke’s Gym Stadium\nis located right in the center of the Galar region!
Noibat loves fruit! It’s always looking for it\nusing ultrasonic waves!
Squilili squililili!
Hi there, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0302)]r.iss Trainer! Have you edited your\nLeague Card at all?\c\nAs you gather material for it, it becomes harder\nand harder to decide what you want to use.\r\nIt’s so much fun!
I have a friend who told me that he dresses up\nas a Pokémon and does Poké Jobs.\c\nBut it’s not me—it’s a friend!
I saw the ruins at Stow-on-Side, but...\nI don’t really get art sometimes...
She keeps going on about art, but really all that\nmatters is whether you like what you see or not.
These clothes I’m wearing, they were given to me\nback when I was a student.\c\nThey’re made from durable Pokémon silk, so I\nbelieve they’ll last me a good while yet!
Not too many Gym Challengers make it all the\nway to Raihan...\c\nI really wish we could see more matches with him\nand his Pokémon.
Opal’s been a Gym Leader for several decades—\nthe very definition of a seasoned veteran...\c\nI doubt you’ll stand a chance.
Chairman Rose himself once participated in the\nChampion Cup. He really took off after\r\nthe Semifinals!
I heard that the Meowth of Galar look different\nfrom the Meowth of Kanto or Alola!\r\nI think it’s called a regional form!
I like my curry sweet, but then my father always\nadds too much bitter seasoning!
A lot of people buy replicas of Leon’s uniform,\nbut nobody can wear it ’cause the cape’s\r\ntoo heavy...
We agreed to meet at the Pokémon Center, but\nI’ve been here awhile, and still no sign...\c\nMaybe I should go check the other\nPokémon Centers?
Gastrodon, I choose you!\nSQUEEEAAA-SQUISHY-SQUISHY-SQUISH!
Rhydon against Gastrodon!\nI’m at a disadvantage in terms of type matchup,\r\nbut experience is on my side!
Todon...
Do don!
I saw a Pokémon sucking nectar from a flower, so\nI decided to copy it!
I wish there were boxed lunches you could eat on\nthe train. They’d be so popular!
Children can’t get through the Wild Area,\nso we have to ride the train.\c\nIt’s safe! We don’t need an adult to ride with us!
At that restaurant, the Pokémon is better at\ncooking my food to perfection.
We all know that dragons guard treasure!\c\nIt’s definitely fitting that Raihan’s the guardian of\nthe vault.
They say that the Galar region has lots of\nold buildings!
I’ve heard that Pokémon in the Wild Area\nhide all sorts of things in their dens.\c\nThere’re apparently even odd Pokémon that\ncollect TRs!
You really should visit Wyndon sometime.\nPeople from all over the world gather there!
Kwaaa!
I wonder if there’s something special about\npeople who find Wishing Stars?
Once I become Champion, I’m going to gather\nall the Wishing Stars in the world and give them\r\nto you!
The curry I made while camping was amazing,\nbut the curry I made at home was only so-so...\r\nI wonder what was different?
Oh, are you headed to Stow-on-Side,\nGym Challenger?\c\nEveryone knows that Route 6 leads on to\nthat good old town!
Hey, this is the final Gym!
You did it!\nYou got the Dragon Badge!
The stadium...\nNot good. This is not good!
Next is Wyndon!\nTime for the big event!
I saw your match in the\nstadium! It was incredible!
What a match!\nThe best battle of this year!
Let’s go, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nLet’s go!
I’ll be cheering for you during\nthe Semifinals!
Here [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she comes!\nIt’s that Trainer!
Oh! I know that Trainer!\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe’s super strong!
Hello!
Think only of victory!
Your matches help me\nfeel brave!
How are things?
You’re stronger than Raihan!\nThat’s amazing!
The Champion’s Pokémon\nare looking good!
Now, where did my Pokémon\nwander off to...
It’s tough trying to find a\nPokémon that can fly.
Turns out my Pokémon was\nat home the whole time!
Amazing!
Am I ever thirsty...\nI wish I had some tea...
I want to go on a trip with my\nPokémon, but where to?
It really makes my blood boil\nwhen I lose a battle!
Time for the Champion Cup!
That red light...\nIt was so scary...
The vault is outside of\nthe stadium.
I heard that underneath the\nstadium is a power plant!
These stadiums...\nSuch odd buildings.
I want a cool Pokémon to\nbe my partner!
My favorite move is Teatime!
My favorite Ability is\nHunger Switch!
My five favorite Pokémon?\nOh, I can’t decide...
I want all the clothes from my\nfavorite brand.
My favorite Trainer is\nthe Champion!
It’s a stone statue of a Poké Ball.\nThere’s a rumor that if you touch it, you’ll have\r\nbetter luck catching Pokémon.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : z_c0301

Muuurrrrrrfff!
Wow...\nThis Pokémon is huge...
I’m glad we live in a world where I can coexist\nwith a giant Pokémon like this!
[~ 3]
[~ 4]
If you’re sitting, you have to stand up eventually,\nright? In the same way, even if you’re defeated,\r\nsooner or later you’ll get back on your feet.
[~ 6]
Mima mime!
You can tell Leon absolutely loves to battle.\nJust look at his smile!
Pokémon Trainers are really amazing!\nI mean, they can compete on the world stage!
Mr. Rose used the power of his company to turn\nthis city into a tourist spot, but without ruining\r\nthe historical buildings and streets!
How many companies does Mr. Rose own again?
[~ 12]
[~ 13]
This Mr. Mime’s name is Marcel!\nIt’s really amazing!
It must be nice to be a supporter of someone.\nIt’s not easy to be so dedicated to a stranger!
If a Trainer I’m cheering for loses, it really brings\nme down, as if I was the one who lost!\c\nEven if the match itself has nothing to do with\nme, that’s what it means to be a supporter.
Better to raise it from a Charmander. You’ll form\na stronger bond that way.
I’m gonna join the Gym Challenge too, with my\nvery own Charizard!
Hello? Yeah, I got tickets for front-row seats in\nthe stadium! Come on over!
I can’t even keep my siblings under control.\nI don’t think I could handle raising six Pokémon.
I’m pretending to be Falinks!
I’m pretending to be Falinks, too!
Me? I’ve been a fan of Leon since he first\nparticipated in the Gym Challenge!
Anybody can say things like “I’ve been a fan for\na long time!” Or “I’ve watched all his matches!”\c\nIt doesn’t prove that you’re a real fan!
Marnie gave me her autograph just now!\nIt’s my treasure!
Isn’t this a huge Ferris wheel?\nIt’s known as the Galar Hurricane.
Don’t listen to my sister—she’s just making\nthings up.
Bridges connect two separate things, so they\ncan be seen as symbols of friendship, too!
When I see a truly amazing battle, it fills my\nwhole body with energy!\c\nI’ve got all the respect in the world for Trainers\nwho can put on matches like that!
Pokémon that work in the hotels and Pokémon\nthat participate in battles...\r\nThey all have a sharp look to them!
[~ 31]
Brrrheeeim!
This kind Pokémon carried us all the way to\nthe hotel.
You’ve gotta give it to Mudsdale.\nI’ve never seen it overloaded, no matter how\r\nmany people are riding it!
I can change my job or even my home, but I can’t\nchange my favorite challenger and my\r\nfavorite Pokémon!
Growlithe!\nI’ll race you to the stadium!
Raihan likes to use Sandstorm first!
I’ll use my speedy Pokémon to defeat any\nPokémon that try to change the weather!
Bork!
[~ 40]
Exactly! My Growlithe lost so much weight!
Running a full circle around Wyndon certainly\nburns a lot of calories...
I clean so that I can properly appreciate the\nbeauty of the flowers.
I’m going for a picnic with my Pokémon!
I cross the bridge one way feeling anticipation\nfor the match I’m going to watch, and then I\r\ncross the bridge the other way feeling excited\r\nafter seeing an amazing match!
We can just walk to the stadium, but challengers\nhave to win if they want to reach it...
I wonder how many houses would fit inside\nWyndon Stadium?!
You never know the weather until you wake up.\nYou never know who will win until it’s done.
Everybody in the world watches the same match.\nThat means everybody in the world can talk to\r\neach other about that same match!
Great matches will always be remembered by\nthe crowd!
Kantonians and Galarians both seem to like\nwaiting in lines...
Get your official merchandise here!\nWe also have League Cards!
I came looking for rare League Cards, but they’re\nall sold out!
Today’s weather is perfect for a match!\c\nI mean, I say that for any weather, and the\nstadium has a roof, but still.
Would you care for some Pokémon snacks\nor Pokémon drinks?
I wasn’t thirsty at all, but all these juices look so\ngood that now I feel parched!
Challengers are just too amazing...\c\nAny mistake they make is seen by tens of\nthousands of fans, but the challengers just keep\r\non battling as if it were nothing.\c\nThey must all have nerves of steel!
He says he likes someone who’s fun to be with,\neven when they’re eating their usual food.
I think the reason why we feel restaurant food is\nso much better than normal food is because of\r\nthe novelty of it all.
We’ll show you the full power of Team Yell!
We’re gonna stay out of trouble this time.\nI mean, we want to watch the matches, too!
[~ 62]
I’m not gonna go into the stadium just yet.\nI want to enter it as a challenger!
Welcome, Challenger!\nPlease, battle to your heart’s content!
Time for the final match...\nEveryone’s got their eyes on you!
That was the best match I’ve ever seen!
Welcome, Challenger!\nPlease, battle to your heart’s content!
This might be the first time we see a Trainer\ndefeat Leon.
I...I’m speechless...\nThat was just...amazing...
Leon, Leon, the greatest Champion ever! ♪\nLeon, Leon, will he be beaten? Never! ♪
My sister just keeps singing Leon’s cheering song!
Charizard’s Max Flare is different from any\nother Pokémon’s!
I won’t lie—I started cheering for Leon because\nmy child is a huge fan.
I’m taking as many pictures as I can.\nThey’re like little slices of time.
I feel like my Pokémon always smiles when we\ntake photos together.
Cheeez!
I’ve got my eyes set on Wyndon Stadium!

So, Sonia’s finally decided\nto become a professor, eh?
The Champion’s match!
Oh man, I can’t believe\nHop lost...
I love Leon, but I love the\nnew Champion, too!
So many people!\nIt’s a little intimidating...
People from all over the\nworld gather here, huh!
The Galar region’s growing\non me.
I always bring up the weather\nwhen meeting new people...
I can’t stop myself from\nsaying what’s on my mind.
There were Pokémon in the\nSlumbering Weald after all!
I train myself together with\nmy Pokémon!
The important thing about\ntraining is to never give up.
A strong will is the secret to\nbecoming a strong Trainer!
Yaaay!\nI’m a Charizard!
I’m gonna Dynamax someday!
I swear I’ll beat the Champion!
This city’s huge...\nLet me check my Town Map.
Even kids can ride the\nFlying Taxis!
I like the monorail, too.\nI think it’s kinda cute!
There must be at least one\nninja around here...
Was there a Pokémon that\nwas like a ninja?
Maybe I’ll challenge the\nChampion myself!
I’ve got my Charizard pose\ndown pat!
I feel a new Champion is\nabout to be born!
I need to get all the official\nmerchandise!
At last!\nThe final match!
The final showdown...\nThis is so exciting!
Hey, it’s [VAR 0100(0000)]!
Strong and noble!\n[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)] is the best!
I’m cheering for you both!\nShow us a good match!
Go on!\nShow us what you can do!
Please!\nCan I have an autograph?!
Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]!
If you want to get around Wyndon, you’ve come\nto the right Flying Taxi, guv’nor! Where’d you like\r\nto go?

All right, guv, here we are!\nJust come to me if you need a ride again!
Talkin’ to me ain’t gonna help you find the\nbad guy, now is it? I’ll cheer you on, so go out\r\nthere and track him down![VAR 0114(000D)]
Urara!
So there are good League staff members,\nand then there’s this bad League staff member,\r\nand the only difference is that the bad one is\r\nwearing sunglasses?\c\nWhy even bother with the different look, then?
If I were this bad League staff member, I’d just\nlose the sunglasses...
We’re crazy busy because of the Champion Cup,\nand yet I can’t get to Rose Tower...\r\nSome League staff aren’t doing their jobs!
There are some League staff that’ve gone and\nstarted up a fan club dedicated to Ms. Oleana...
I’ve heard that the Champion and Chairman Rose\nare having a very important discussion right now...\c\nI wonder what it’s all about?
It’s finally time for the Champion Cup!\nBeing super busy makes you want to slack off,\r\ndoesn’t it?
I want to get to Rose Tower but the monorail\nisn’t moving...
There’s no sign of that bad League staff!\nWhere’d they go?!
I’m looking for something to\nlook for!

I hope everything is OK in Hammerlocke...

If your precious Pokémon get injured, don’t\nforget to heal them up with a Potion!\c\nAnd you need Antidotes to fix up poison.\c\nJust remember to stock up on items, and you\nwon’t have to visit Pokémon Centers so often!

I heard that Leon has a younger brother...\c\nI bet he’s an amazing Trainer, just like Leon!
All around here is just quiet countryside,\nbut wait until you see a big city.\c\nIt’ll take your breath away!
Pokémon become stronger by battling.\c\nBut how you raise them is where you get to show\noff your skills as a Trainer.
Leon’s just amazing!\nHe’s a superstar to everyone!
The Charizard pose!\c\nJust doing the pose along with Leon makes me\nfeel like I’ve gotten stronger!
In the morning, my Pokémon wakes me up, and\nin the evening, I put my Pokémon to bed...\c\nI can’t imagine a life without Pokémon!
I’ve just remembered what the sign here\nused to say.\c\n“To the right is the Pokémon Lab.\nOn the opposite side is the station.”
I used to want to be a professional Pokémon\nTrainer when I grow up!\c\nBut I can’t think about Pokémon day in and day\nout, the way Leon does...
It’s fun to do some shopping in a boutique!\c\nEven just getting a new hat can change your\nwhole look!
If you’re looking for the Pokémon Professor, you\ncan usually find her at her lovely home by the\r\nlake, enjoying the slow life.

Milo does more than just work the fields.\nHe raises beautiful flowers, too!
Fluff fluff...
If you hold flowers, Pokémon will gather\naround you!
The League Cards of Gym Leaders tell all sorts\nof stories.
You can challenge the Gyms as many times\nas you want.\c\nI guess it’s to test your unbreakable will!
If you’ve never seen it before, you should really\ngo see the amazing scenery from the hilltop.\c\nIn fact, you should go see it again even if you\nhave seen it before.
That geoglyph... I heard nobody knows its name.\nMaybe it was a forbidden name or something...
I took a photo of the geoglyph, but it just\ndoesn’t compare to seeing it yourself.\c\nStill, looking at the photo is enough to bring\nback a rush of emotions!
How can a geoglyph drawn ages ago last for so\nlong without eroding away?\c\nIt’s so perplexing! If I think too much about it,\nI won’t be able to sleep.
You know what I think?\c\nI think the geoglyph was created with the help\nof Pokémon.
I wanna stick my head into the photo stand-in\nwhen I grow taller!
Such mysterious stone structures...\c\nWere they made by people...or by Pokémon?
If you don’t take proper care of your equipment,\nit can fail you when you really need it.
Route 5 is really long...\nIt feels good to speed through it, though!
More people are coming to\nsee the geoglyph these days.
You could say Milo raised all\nthe Trainers here!
The new Champion is\npretty amazing!
Time for the Gym Challenge.\nHow exciting!
I can’t believe Milo lost...

Why does Nessa love the lighthouse so much...?
Galar is a huge island.\c\nLighthouses have always been really important in\nhelping ships find their way.
When you see one of those giant Pokémon\nwhile fishing in the Wild Area, it feels like\r\nit’s either catch or be caught!
Nessa’s really stoic about Pokémon.\nShe’s made her Gym mission really tough!
I remember when I did the Gym Challenge...\nI never did get the Water Badge.
I’ve got high hopes for you!\nI mean, I say that to every challenger, of course.
Freshly harvested veggies! Look good, don’t they?\nFreshly gathered Berries! I guess they look good?
Mistakes aren’t that bad when you cook with\nyour mates. At least they make for funny stories!
Galar Mine No. 2 is a good spot.\nIt’s full of rock-solid Pokémon.
Truuummm!

I bet it’s gonna be tough to\ndefeat Nessa.
You defeated Nessa! You’re\nquite the Trainer!

Nessa always gathers the\nbest food!

What’s going on?!\nI heard a huge noise come from the direction\r\nof the mural!\c\nIs this some sort of surprise event for tourists?
We should let the people at Ballonlea know\nabout what happened with the mural.\c\nLet’s see now... To reach Ballonlea, you have to\nhead through that mushroom forest.
Cap cap.
The places where you can Dynamax your\nPokémon are known as Power Spots.\c\nThe Gym Stadiums of the Galar region are\nbuilt on these Power Spots.
Wh-wh-what’s going on?!\nWhat’s happening at the ruins?
Wh-wh-what’s this? The hero was actually two\npeople and Pokémon?
Quite an impressive Gym Stadium!
Sudden, big noises are a great way to get people\nfeeling uneasy...
I feel it was more artistic before it got destroyed.
The ocean, huh...\nNot a mountain, huh...
I’ve seen you before...\nAre you a Gym Challenger?
That young lady, Sonia...\c\nShe’s researching the truth about the ruins, right?\nCould she be the granddaughter of\r\nProfessor Magnolia?
Some Pokémon live in the mountains, some\nPokémon live in the forests!\r\nSo many different species!
What was that noise...?\nThunder? No, it couldn’t have been...
If you want to get to Ballonlea, you’ll need to\nmake your way through Glimwood Tangle.\c\nRemember, in Glimwood Tangle...\nIt’s important to touch the mushrooms.
Are you a tourist?\nOr a Gym Challenger?
What a match!\nA fantastic battle, that!
It’s the Champion that\ndiscovered the hidden ruins!
I hear the Gym mission\nreally makes you dizzy!
Everyone seems wobbly,\neven if they get the Badge...
Wow, the Champion!\nWicked!

The market hasn’t been too\ngood to me recently...
To be honest...I don’t think\nthe mural looks that good.

Igna!
I hear that Pokémon in Poké Balls or Boxes\nare nice and comfortable.
The Hero’s Bath...\nI hear this hot spring has been around since\r\nancient times.
I watch the Gym Leaders’ matches on the giant\ntelly in the stadium!
Dragon-type Pokémon are weak to Ice-type\nmoves! Maybe they don’t like cold, huh?
Muscles! No cold is too cold if you have powerful\nmuscles to keep you warm!
You’re in trouble if your Pokémon gets frozen\nduring a battle! It won’t be able to move!
Are snowmen Pokémon?
I know there are Ice-type Pokémon, but is\nthere such a thing as snowman Pokémon?
[~ 12]
The falling snow hides the Ice-type Pokémon\naround here really well.
Seems like the hot spring’s a perfect temperature\ntoday, too. Only Pokémon bathe in it, though.
It’s easy to get depressed when it’s cold.\c\nBut Darumaka are able to store more strength\nthe colder it gets. I’m jealous!
Rolly roll.

Seems like the hot spring’s a perfect temperature\ntoday, too. Only Pokémon bathe in it, though.
Is that a Persian engraved on this wall?
Goro goh!
The stones paving the ground are quite cold.\nSnow piles up on them in no time.
There are plenty of people who enjoy Pokémon\nbattles, even if they can’t participate in the\r\nGym Challenge. Actually, there are people who\r\ndon’t battle at all, too.
They say this is the hot spring where the hero\nrested his wounded body.
I try to remove chance from my battles as much\nas possible, but sometimes I still feel it all comes\r\ndown to luck...
I thought I was going to lose for sure, but then\nmy Pokémon scored a critical hit!
Iiissse.
The Gym Challenge is\nreaching its end.
I wonder who made it to\nthe tournament?
Becoming the Champion on\nyour first try... Amazing!
I love the snow so much!
I, said the Pokémon.
If rain is the sky crying, then\nwhat is snow?
I’m just keeping an eye\non the town.
I’ve been walking around so\nmuch, I’m almost too healthy!
Nothing like a nice, long\nwalk after a good meal!
I need to get curry toppings\nat Bob’s Your Uncle.
The curry is what brings the\nrice and ingredients together.
All sorts of flavors become\none in curry.
People and Pokémon should\nbe full of energy!
Getting Badges is no trouble\nwith enough energy!
The Gym Challenge was such\na great competition this year!
The ancient hero liked\nthe hot spring, huh?
What exactly did the hero do?
Is the Champion a hero?
The ancient Hero’s Bath.\c\nIt is said that heroes bathed here to heal\nand rest.
Sometimes the only thing to do in the cold\nweather is have an ice cream!

At the end of the day, this place’d be more lively\nif there were more Gym Challengers.
Speaking of Piers, he refuses to Dynamax\nhis Pokémon!\c\nBut the chairman tried to move the Gym to\na kinda faraway place near a Power Spot.
Closing the shutter to sabotage the other\nchallengers was right poor sportsmanship.

Welcome, one and all!
Welcome to the wonderful world of Pokémon!
Our beloved Galar region is a wonderful place,\nwith thriving nature...
beautiful cities, and many Pokémon with which\nwe share our lives!
As you know, our society is able to thrive...
thanks to help from these mysterious creatures\nthat we call Pokémon.
Yes, Pokémon are all around us—in the sea,\nin the sky, and even with us in our towns!
And those of us who choose to raise and train\nPokémon to do battle and compete...
we call Pokémon Trainers!
Oh! But I’m getting carried away. Please allow\nme to introduce myself.\c\nMy name is Rose, and it is a pleasure to be here.
Now turn your gaze to the Galar region’s greatest\nPokémon Trainer, your undefeated Champion...
It’s time for Champion Leon’s exhibition match!
Exhibition or not, Leon, your pristine record\nis about to end—when I beat you here today!
[~ 14]
You know I don’t lose battles, Raihan!
Charizard! Dynamax!

It probably goes without saying, but...\nhello, Galar! I’m your Champion, Leon!
The chairman is tied up with some business, so I\nhope no one minds me stepping in on his behalf...
in order to lead you all to greater heights\nas Pokémon Trainers of the Galar region!
The time has come for you to battle it out until\nonly the greatest challenger remains!
So, on behalf of the chairman, allow me to say...\nlet the Finals matches begin!

Hello there, Leon and [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nJust letting you know...
I think it’s time I brought about the Darkest Day.\nFor the sake of Galar’s future, of course!
But I’m in a bit of a pickle. The energy released\nby the Darkest Day is too much for us to contain.
I’m sorry it’s come to this. But it’s you who forced\nmy hand, Leon. You refused to listen!

Uh...\nNow who was I again?\c\n... ... ...\n... ... ...\c\nOh yes! I’m the Move Deleter!\nI can make Pokémon forget their moves.
You’re here so I can make your Pokémon forget\na move, um-hmm?

Just remember me when there’s something you\nwant to forget!
What’s that, friend?\nThat Pokémon only knows one move, you know?
What’s this, friend?\nEggs don’t know any moves before they hatch.
Mm-hmm...\nAnd which move should it forget?
It was a great success!\c\nYour Pokémon has forgotten that it ever even\nknew [VAR 0107(0000)]!
Everyone calls me Madam Memorial.\c\nI know every move that a Pokémon learns as it\ngrows, you see.\c\nI can also help your Pokémon remember any of\nthose moves that it has let go in the past.\c\nI’ll help your Pokémon recover their lost moves\nin exchange for Heart Scales, if you have any.
Would you like to remind your Pokémon of a\nlong-forgotten move?
If there’s a move you want one of your Pokémon\nto recall, bring me a [VAR 0109(0000)]!
Which Pokémon is it?
That is an Egg.
This Pokémon doesn’t yet have any moves to\nbe recovered.
Which move would you like it to remember?
You gave a [VAR 0109(0000)] in thanks.

Let me explain really nicely how to take part in\nRanked Battles!\c\nAnd I’ll fix you up so your Pokémon can take part\nin Ranked Battles now, too.
Do you have Pokémon you’d like to enter\nin a Ranked Battle?
See you around, then!
Which Pokémon would you like to enter in a\nRanked Battle?
The [VAR 0101(0000)] you chose can take part\nin this Ranked Battle, all right!
So, we’ll be having [VAR 0101(0000)] forget the\nmoves that it knew before in order to learn the\r\nmoves for this Ranked Battle. That fine by you?
It might forget some really rare moves that’ll be\nimpossible for it to relearn. That’s all right, too?

I found this three days ago, but I’ll give it to you!
Though...use caution, you know?\nIt is at least three days old, after all.
I don’t know how this ended up in my pocket...\nso here—why don’t you take it!
The question is...how did it get in my pocket?
I was just walking along when this fell on me from\nabove... Why don’t you take it?
After all, I’ve only got painful memories of it...\nhitting me on the head, that is.
I stumbled upon this buried in the ground.\nWhy don’t you have it?
I don’t plan on being tripped up in my journey,\nso better you to take it than me!
A wild Pokémon was holding this when I caught it.\nTake it!
Do you think Pokémon like these things, too?
I found something amazing just now.\nThink I’ll give it to you!
It’s amazing, so you’d better take proper\ncare of it and not lose it!
Do you know if there’s anything to find\nover yonder?
Seeing all this wide, open space...simply makes\nyou want to run wild, doesn’t it?
I’m gonna find loads of Pokémon!
Hey, fancy meeting you again!\nHope you’re doing well.

I’m crazy strong and flush with cash!\nWhy won’t anyone battle me?!\r\nHow about you? Dare to take me on?
You’re crazy strong, too!\nI’ll teach you a good trick then.\c\nThere are heaps of items lying around the\nWild Area that people have dropped!\c\nGo around picking them up and then selling ’em\noff, and you can be flush with cash, too!
I’ll work on getting even stronger yet, so come\nfind me for another battle sometime!
Ahhh! Winning makes me feel generous, so I\nthink I’ll teach you a good trick!\c\nThere are heaps of items lying around the\nWild Area that people have dropped!\c\nGo around picking them up and then selling ’em\noff, and you can be flush with cash, too!
Hey there! I found a bit of a rare item here in\nthe Wild Area. You want it? Only [VAR 0200(0000)] W!
Looks like we have a deal!\nI hope it helps you out a bit on your adventure!
You enjoying the Wild Area?\c\nYou know some items are easiest to get through\nMax Raid Battles, right?
Hahaha! I guess it does sound a bit suspect\nwhen you stop to think about it, eh?\c\nBut if you change your mind, you know where to\nfind me!
I fished up something brilliant!\nThis is absolutely...brilliant!\c\nWant my brilliant find for a brilliant\nbargain of just [VAR 0203(0000,002C)] W?!
Well, that was a brilliant choice you just made!\nThen here you are! As promised!
Think I’ll fish myself up another brilliant find!
Whaaat?! What a brilliant blunder for you...
All right. Snap to it.\nLet the battle begin!
Oh, yes? Right then.\nRight shame that is.
You don’t have enough Watts, pal...\c\nTry checking out any glowing dens you find to\ngather up some more!
You don’t have enough brilliant beaming Watts!\nYou’d better hurry, or I might hook a better deal!
There’s energy pouring out from the den!
There’s a bit of energy trickling out of the den...
You obtained [VAR 0204(0000,002C)] W!
Heya, all right?\nWe two brothers are known as the Digging Duo!\r\nWe’re digging up treasure here, see?
You’ve got a fair bit of luck finding us here!\c\nIf you’d like to spot us some Watts, we’ll dig you\nup some handy treasures for your adventure!
All right? Let me tell ya... I’ve no lack of stamina,\nbut when it comes to skill, my brother’s the best!\c\nWant me to dig you up some treasure?\nIt’ll only cost you [VAR 0204(0001,002C)] W!\r\nAnd a wee saving of your progress, too.

Thanks for your support!\nThen I’ll dig up all I can for ya!
Thanks for your support!\nThen I’ll dig up the best find I can for ya!
That right? Sure, sure.\nBut no need to be shy. Come ask us anytime!
That right? Sure, sure.\nCome visit us again anytime, though!
Bingo! It’s [VAR 1302(0000,0000)][VAR 010A(0000)]!
Should I keep digging, then?
Yeah? Probably wise.\nI’ve still got some petrol in the ol’ tank, though.
Phew! I’m all tuckered out...\nI guess that’s probably it for this dig!
I managed to dig up [VAR 0202(0000)] treasure[VAR 1101(0000,0100)]s this time.\nTake good care of [VAR 1101(0000,0402)]itthem!
Oh? What...\nYou haven’t got the Watts!\c\nIf you want more Watts, maybe try searching out\nsome Pokémon Dens and looking into them!
Wait! No! I’m not finished yet!\nI can still keep on digging!
Dig for me!
I’m good
What’s your best record?
My greatest record is [VAR 0202(0000)] treasure[VAR 1101(0000,0100)]s in one go.\nTold you I wasn’t lacking in stamina, eh?

Whoa?! Feast your eyes on this one!\nThis is a mighty rare find, you jammy thing!
You! Yes, you! You’ve got Pokémon with you,\nhaven’t you? You camp with them, don’t you?\c\nAnd you cook alongside them, right?\nDelicious curries will cure them of whatever\r\nails them, you know!\c\nAnd you can get Berries to cook up curries at\ntrees like that one right there! Yes, right there!\c\nAnd if you want more ingredients, talk to me!\nI’ll sell you all my freshest finds for real cheap!
How are you doing, young friend? Would you\nlike me to help see you to the next town?
To Motostoke, please!
To Hammerlocke, please!
No, thanks
[~ 102]
Then simply leave it to me!
Here we are! And when you’ve trained up a bit,\ngive the Wild Area another chance, would you?\r\nShe’s got some fine secrets, she does.
If your Pokémon are ever getting a bit ragged\nout here, set up camp and cook them up a nice\r\nmeal to have them feeling better in no time.
You found a note! Did someone drop it here?\c\n“The large Pokémon you see wandering around\nin the Wild Area are strong!\c\n“If you try battling one and it seems like you’re\nin over your head, try to run! Run like the wind!”
You found a note! Did someone drop it here?\c\n“Cooking at your camp can restore HP to your\nPokémon, and even the PP they need to use\r\ntheir moves over and over!\c\n“Pokémon that have fainted and can’t battle\nany longer will perk right up as well with a piping\r\nhot plate of curry before them!\c\n“Visit Berry trees to collect plenty of Berries,\nso you can always make more curries!”
Hi there!\nWould you like to rest your Pokémon?
Thanks for stopping by!\nWould you like to buy anything before you go?
On your way to Motostoke?\c\nIf you are, you’ll find it just up over that rise\nand to the east!\c\nOnce you find the walls of the city, just follow\nthem till you reach the stairs!
Isn’t there anyone who wants to come join me\nfor a Max Raid Battle?\c\nIf only people would let me know on Y-Comm,\nI’d have them join me in a heartbeat!
You found a note! Did someone drop it here?\c\n“Use the Right Stick to rotate the camera when\nyou’re in the Wild Area!\c\n“And if you press the Right Stick,\nyou’ll find you can see a wider view of things!\c\n“Press the L Button to look straight ahead again!”
You found a note! Did someone drop it here?\c\n“The Wild Area is overflowing with a special sort\nof energy, measured in Watts!\c\n“You can gather Watts yourself from glowing\nPokémon Dens and glowing Pokémon in the wild!\c\n“You’ll also find Trainers in the Wild Area who\nare willing to give you all sorts of items if you’ll\r\njust give them some of your Watts!”

There’s something written on the old pedestal.\nDo you want to read it?
May 7\nOnce, these lusciously green lands of ours\nlay barren. The grass wilted. Our crops withered.\nThis was a tundra shrouded in frigid cold.
Many days into a bleak winter, a Pokémon\nappeared on the tundra—adorned with a regal\ncrown yet wounded and weak. Full of pity,\nour people brought the Pokémon to our village\nand saw to its care.
August 18\nUnder the care of our ancestors’ healing ways,\nthe visitor’s wounds mended. It shrank back in\nfear if approached with open palms, so all kept\ntheir hands closed in its presence.
Once it regained its full strength, the visitor\nemitted a dazzling blue light that breathed life\nback into our wilted fields, blessing them with\nthe promise of harvests once more. Perhaps this\nwas its way of showing its gratitude.
November 30\nGreen flourished once more around our village,\nand rich soil began to spread. Vast lands lay\nopen for farming once more. The village folk\nbegan to call the visitor a king in appreciation.
Our village had long been plagued by a ruffian\nthat ran rampant through the fields, devouring\ncrops as it pleased. But the king, resplendent in\nits full power, suddenly spoke to us in our\ntongue, vowing to rein in the ruffian.
January 2\nBefore long, the ruffian had bent its knees to the\nking and become its loyal steed. Our people’s\nfaith in the king grew firm and unwavering.
Our ancestors built a temple around the sacred\nsapling atop a tall mountain to give the king\na worthy home. Moreover, they crafted a set of\nreins to let the king command its proud steed\nwith ease.
April 21\nThe king brought abundance and life to this land\nthat was once frozen tundra. We owe these very\nCrown Plains to our king.
And as long as the bond between us people and\nour king holds strong, these lands will no doubt\nthrive for all time in fertile green.

If you want to meet mysterious Pokémon that\ndisappeared from the world long ago...\c\nThen you’ll have to find some Fossils first!\nYou do know about Fossils, right?
If you find any Fossils, you can have my pa\ntake a look at them for you.
Fossils are the remains of ancient Pokémon\nthat have been preserved in the ground.\c\nThey can be restored and brought back to life\nso we can meet those ancient Pokémon again!\c\nWhat do you think? It’s pretty amazing, right?
Wow!\nYou’re pretty amazing yourself!\c\nYou’ve found every known Fossil that can be\nrestored into a living Pokémon, haven’t you?\c\nThat is just so amazing that I think I will have to\ngive you a little reward!\c\nThis is your proof of being a Fossil Master!
Are you a Fossiphiliac, too?\nA Fossil fan, my fine [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl!\c\nIf you are, you might know the answer to this...\c\nWhat did my sweet [VAR 0109(000A)] turn\ninto when I had it restored?\c\nIf you’d like to see for yourself, how about a\nPokémon battle?
That’s a real shame! Don’t let that refusal\nfossilize—come back and fight me anytime!
That’s right! Sweet little [VAR 0109(000A)]\nbecomes a fine [VAR 0101(000B)]!
I hope I’ll get to meet more sweet little Fossils\nsoon, not just my [VAR 0109(000A)]!

Welcome, Champion!\nWould you like to take part in a tournament?
Understood! Perhaps next time, then!
Is there a particular Trainer you’d like to invite\nto take part in the tournament today?
There is someone...
No one in particular
Who would you like to invite to take part?
Next
Quit
[VAR 0100(0000)]
You’d like to invite [VAR 0100(0000)]?
Then I’ll take you through to the pitch.\nAnd good luck!
Very good!\nIt looks like your invitation has been accepted!\c\nI’ll take you through to the pitch now.\nAnd good luck!
Congratulations on another victory!\nPlease take your reward!
We look forward to your next visit!
Well, that’s a rather disappointing outcome...\nBut you’ll get ’em next time, Champion!\c\nWe look forward to your next visit!
You’re on a real roll, Champion!\nLet me offer my ultra-great congratulations!
I’m really feeling bowled over here...\nSo here! Take this and have a ball battling!
Welcome, Champion!\nLeon is waiting for you.
You need a partner if you want to participate in\nthe Galarian Star Tournament.\c\nWhy not go speak to the Trainers around here?\nThey might be looking for a partner, too!
Very good. We’ll register you and Marnie as\npartners. Now then, are you ready to proceed?
Very good. We’ll register you and Hop as\npartners. Now then, are you ready to proceed?
Yes
No
In that case, please head into the locker room.
Understood. Please just come and speak to me\nwhen you’re ready!
Welcome! Which competition would you like to\ntake part in this time?
The usual tournament
The Galarian Star Tournament
Never mind
Very good.\nIn that case, please choose your partner!
Congratulations! Here’s something to\ncommemorate your victory!
[VAR BE05(0006)]You received [VAR 0205(0001,002C)] for winning!
You got the [VAR FF00(0008)]Sport Uniform[VAR FF00(0000)]!
One more thing. It seems there are some more\nTrainers who want to pair up with you after\r\nseeing your amazing performance this time.\c\nWhy not try teaming up with someone new the\nnext time you decide to participate?
Too bad about this time, but you still get a\nparticipation award!
We hope you decide to participate again soon!
One more thing. It seems there are some more\nTrainers who want to pair up with you after—
Well, well, well![VAR 0114(0042)]
If it isn’t M[VAR 1100(00FF,0205)]asters. [VAR 0100(0000)]! It seems your\ntalents have only grown greater since we last met![VAR 0114(0042)]
I would expect no less from one whom we\nourselves call a celebrity![VAR 0114(0042)]
It is I, Sordward![VAR 0114(0068)]
And I, Shielbert![VAR 0114(0069)]
A dandy duo of celebrities, former royalty, and—\nas it so happens—the sponsors of the Galarian\r\nStar Tournament![VAR 0114(0068)]
Just so it’s clear, being a sponsor means paying\na jaw-dropping sum of money.[VAR 0114(0069)]
The truth is, we have both been assisting in\ngetting this tournament off the ground for quite\r\nsome time now.[VAR 0114(0068)]
This is how we seek to atone for the terrible\ntroubles we’ve caused for the people of Galar![VAR 0114(0069)]
And naturally, we’ve been participating in the\ntournament too, of course.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Though it’s hardly surprising that you did not\nnotice us, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0205)]asters. [VAR 0100(0000)]. We always\r\nlose in the first match for whatever reason![VAR 0114(0069)]
Wahahahah![VAR 0114(006A)]
However, it’s getting to the point where I would\nlike to at least have some victories to speak of![VAR 0114(0068)]
If all we do is lose, what was the point of using\nour considerable clout as sponsors to join in?[VAR 0114(0069)]
So, seeing as that is the situation...[VAR 0114(006A)]
you and I together are sure to be able to reach\nnew heights of glory, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0205)]asters. [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0068)]
Forgive me, Brother, but I must disagree.\nIt is I who shall share the victors’ stand with\r\nM[VAR 1100(00FF,0205)]asters. [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0069)]
Hmm...hmm... I see, dear Brother.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Hmm...hmm...hmm... Indeed, dear Brother.[VAR 0114(0069)]
Well, then! Apologies for rudely interrupting from\nsuch an elevated position.[VAR 0114(0068)]
We do enjoy elevated positions so much![VAR 0114(0069)]
We look forward to a favorable decision\nregarding our proposal![VAR 0114(0068)]
And with that, farewell![VAR 0114(0069)]
All this attention may be a bit much...\nBut please do participate again with a new\r\npartner next time!
I see you’ve chosen a partner!\nVery well, then. I’ll process your entry.\r\n... ... ...\c\nThere we are!\nAll teams have been successfully registered!

The repellent’s effect wore off!
The repellent’s effect wore off!\nWould you like to use another one?
You used [VAR 1302(0001,0000)][VAR 010A(0001)].
[~ 3]
It’s a sturdy-looking rock.\nMaybe a powerful Pokémon could break it...
[~ 5]
It’s a big heavy-looking boulder.\nMaybe a powerful Pokémon could move it...
...Oh?
Do you want to call Tauros?
Do you want to call Machamp?
Do you want to call Sharpedo?
There is not enough space to call this\nRide Pokémon here.
You can’t ride your bicycle right now.
You can’t get down from your bicycle here.
Your Pokémon Boxes are full!\nBetter to try again later.
You jotted down the current status on\n[VAR 0109(0001)].

I just can’t seem to catch a Galarian Meowth...\nIf you’ve got a Galarian Meowth, want to trade it\r\nfor my Meowth?
Wow, it’s so cute! You’re OK with trading for\nmy Pokémon?
I see. Well, let me know if you change your mind!
Hooray! It’s the Galarian Meowth of my dreams!\nI’ll take such good care of it!\c\nDepending on the region, some Pokémon may\nhave a different appearance or types!
Thanks for the Galarian Meowth! How is Cash?
Huh? You’ve only got one Pokémon! You’ll need\nat least two Pokémon if you want to trade.

Say, if you’ve got a Bunnelby...would you like to\ntrade it for my Skwovet?

I’ll take great care of your Bunnelby! So take care\nof my Skwovet, too!
I’m looking after the Bunnelby you traded me\nwith great care!

Hey there. You happen to catch a lot of\nMaractus? How about trading one for\r\nmy Hatenna?
You good with trading that one?

Have you caught any Yamask in Galar? If you\nhave, would you be interested in trading for the\r\nYamask I caught abroad?
Are you OK with trading me that Yamask?
Oh no... I’m so sad.
Hehe. What a great trade!
Is the super-rare Yamask that I caught\nbehaving itself?
It’s kind of hard to trade when you’ve only got\none Pokémon with you. Please come back when\r\nyou’ve got more.

I’d really fancy catching a Vanillish, but catching\nPokémon is a young person’s game, by gum.\c\nI sure would be glad if someone would trade me\na Vanillish for my Throh...
Oho. You’ll trade with me?
Perhaps I’ll ask another Trainer...
Oho! Quite the splendid Vanillish, I say. You have\nmy gratitude!
Oho! This Vanillish sure is a cute one! I want to\nstay with it forever!
Ah, sorry young [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]manlady, but if you want to trade,\nyou’ll need to have at least two Pokémon in your\r\nparty. Come back when you do, eh?

You sure you wanna trade that Obstagoon?

You don’t have enough Pokémon in your party\nfor a Pokémon trade. You need at least two if\r\nyou wanna trade...

Hello. Do you want to use this and awaken your\nPokémon’s hidden powers?
Hidden Power changes type depending on the\nPokémon that learns it. Somehow I can tell what\r\ntype that move will be.\c\nIf you’d like, I’ll check what type of\nHidden Power your Pokémon will learn.\r\nWould you like to know this?
If you’d like, I’ll check what type of Hidden\nPower your Pokémon will learn.\r\nWould you like to know this?
If this Pokémon were to learn Hidden Power,\nthe move’s type would be [VAR 0103(0000)].
The type of this Pokémon’s Hidden Power is\n[VAR 0103(0000)]!
If you want to know, just ask me.
I don’t think it’s possible for an Egg to use\nHidden Power.
Unfortunately, this Pokémon can’t learn\nto use Hidden Power.

Welcome to the Nursery.\nHow may I help you?
Nice to see a new face around here.\nThis is a Pokémon Nursery.\c\nWe take care of people’s Pokémon here.\c\nWhen people leave two Pokémon with us,\nwe sometimes find Eggs.\c\nIf you’re interested in that sort of thing,\nask the old lady inside to tell you more.\c\nDo you want to leave any Pokémon with me?
Do come back soon.
We found your Pokémon holding an Egg.\nWould you like to take it?
Is that so?\nIn that case, we’ll keep it ourselves.
You received an Egg from the Nursery worker!
Take good care of it, and raise it well.
It looks like your Boxes are all full.\nHave a look at them and come again, won’t you?
[VAR 0101(0000)] is doing just fine.
Your [VAR 0102(0000)] and [VAR 0102(0001)] are\ndoing just fine.\c\nThey really seem to enjoy each other’s company.
Your [VAR 0102(0000)] and [VAR 0102(0001)] are\ndoing just fine.\c\nThey seem to get along all right.
Your [VAR 0102(0000)] and [VAR 0102(0001)] are\ndoing just fine. Though...\c\nThey don’t seem very fond of one another.
Your [VAR 0102(0000)] and [VAR 0102(0001)] are\ndoing just fine. Though...\c\nThey don’t seem to like playing together at all...
I’m afraid you’d be left with too few Pokémon\nif I took any from you now.
You can leave up to two Pokémon with us.\nWhich Pokémon should we look after?
We’re looking after [VAR 0102(0000)] now.\nWhich other Pokémon would you like us to take?
It will cost 1,000 to leave two Pokémon.\nWould you like to leave them both?
It will cost 500 to leave one Pokémon.\nWould you like to leave your Pokémon with me?
That will be an additional 500, please.
Then you can trust us with both [VAR 0102(0000)]\nand [VAR 0102(0001)]! I’ll take fine care of them.
Then leave [VAR 0102(0000)] with me.
Whenever you want to collect your Pokémon,\ndo let me know.
You don’t seem to have enough money...
Things are going just fine. Would you like to take\nyour Pokémon back anyway?
Just a moment, then.\nI’ll go get your [VAR 0102(0000)].
[~ 25]
Would you care to take [VAR 0102(0000)], too?
You don’t have many Pokémon in your party,\nso I can only take one from you just now.
Welcome to the Nursery!\nHow can I help you?
Hello! This here is the Wild Area branch of the\nPokémon Nursery!\c\nWe’re just as capable as the Nursery on Route 5.\nDon’t you worry about a thing!\c\nWill you be leaving any Pokémon with us today?
Come again!
Your Pokémon was found holding an Egg!\nWould you like to take it with you?
If you’re sure, then I’ll keep it myself!
[~ 33]
Take good care of it, and raise it well!

I’m a Pokémon Nursery lady.\c\nI help take care of the Pokémon of Trainers\nlike you.\c\nLately, for some reason, I see some Pokémon\nholding Eggs. It’s mysterious, isn’t it?\c\nIf you want us to take care of your Pokémon,\nplease speak to my sister inside the building.

You received the Egg from the Pokémon\nNursery lady.
Please take good care of it!
Oh, your party is full...\c\nPlease come back again after making space for\nthe Egg.
I’ll keep it if you don’t want it, but you want it,\ndon’t you?
Then I’ll take it.\nThank you.

If you leave the Pokémon with me, you won’t be\nable to battle.\c\nPlease come back again with more Pokémon.
Which Pokémon shall I take care of?
Don’t be silly.\nThat’s an Egg!
All right. I’ll take care of your [VAR 0101(0000)]\nfor a while.
Come back again after a while.
We can take up to two of your Pokémon.\nWould you like to leave one more Pokémon?

It’s a Shiny Charm!\nJust having one of these makes it more likely\r\nthat you’ll encounter Shiny Pokémon!
And that’s not all!\c\nHere’s a little something special that would go\nwell on a tireless Trainer like you, who’s been\r\nrunning all around Alola to fill your Pokédex!
You received a set of the Karate Gi Jacket and\nKarate Gi Pants!

It’s a plant with a gentle fragrance.\nPokémon probably like it, too.
When the fireplace isn’t in use, Pokémon come\nin and out through the chimney.
It’s a fridge with some scratches on it.\nDid Pokémon try to open it?

[VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nPrepare yourself, for I shall now use my psychic\npowers to Teleport you to the top with me![VAR 0114(0072)]
That was a truly elegant battle, wouldn’t you\nagree, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nI am trusting you to continue in this elegant vein.[VAR 0114(0072)]
My Future Sight told me that we would come\nthis far together!\c\nNow, let us bear witness to what is yet to come\nas well![VAR 0114(0072)]
You really knew what you were doing when you\nchose me as a partner, didn’t you? Hee hee!\c\nLet’s melt down our rivals into itty-bitty pieces![VAR 0114(0071)]
You know, you and me make a better combo\nthan I would’ve expected!\c\nIf you like, maybe we can keep teaming up\neven after the competition, too.[VAR 0114(0071)]
I’m so excited that my whole body’s shaking...\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)]! We’re gonna rip victory away\nfrom the competition, you hear?![VAR 0114(0071)]
Woo-hoo! I can’t believe little ol’ me gets to\nbattle alongside Champion [VAR 0100(0000)]!\r\nLet’s have some fun until we’ve won![VAR 0114(0073)]
Just what I’ve come to expect from you!\nYou’re just the sort of student I can entrust all\r\nmy secrets to—even my secret game exploits![VAR 0114(0073)]
We’ve finally reached the tippy-top!\c\nLet’s have the time of our lives giving all the\nspectators in the stadium the time of their lives![VAR 0114(0073)]
Hey, Chief!\nI’ve gotta say—I’m chuffed you chose me!\c\nNot sure if I can keep up with a Champ like you,\nbut I’ll try not to hold you back! Gahahaaa![VAR 0114(0076)]
That first match went off without a hitch!\nLet’s roll right over ’em in round two, too.\c\nMy darlin’ Nia said she’d come watch, so I’ve\ngotta make sure she sees her papa at his best![VAR 0114(0076)]
No surprises there, eh?\nYou and me, we’re a match made in legend!\c\nLet’s keep it turned up to a hundred till\nwe’ve seen this all the way through,\r\nChief [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0076)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nWith you and me battling side by side, we’re sure\nto be the greatest thing Galar has ever seen!\c\nLet’s ensure everyone has a good time by making\nthis the greatest tournament ever![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’m seeing even greater strength from you than\nyou’ve shown me before, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nI was so pumped up that I nearly had Charizard\nattack your team by accident![VAR 0114(0004)]
Looks like we’ve reached the pinnacle of our\nchampion time together!\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\nThis is it! The greatest final match ever![VAR 0114(0004)]
Seriously? Wasn’t there anyone else willing to\npartner with you?[VAR 0114(000C)]
At least you won’t hold me back in battle, like\nmost of these other Trainers would have done.[VAR 0114(000C)]
The final match, is it?\c\nIt doesn’t really matter, though. Winning with you\nat my side won’t prove my strength to anyone.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Thanks for choosin’ me for this tournament.\c\nMorpeko seems real pleased to get to battle\nalongside your team, too.[VAR 0114(000D)]
I’ve been workin’ on really polishin’ up my skills\nlately, since I’m a Gym Leader now an’ all that.\c\nI won’t let you steal the spotlight this whole\nbattle, even if you are the Champion![VAR 0114(000D)]
I’m really lookin’ forward to gettin’ to share this\nwin with you.\c\nThat’s why there’s no way we’re losin’ here in the\nfinal round![VAR 0114(000D)]
It’s quite the honor, getting handpicked by the\nreigning Champion.\c\nSo let’s have a great time together, taking it\nnice and slow.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Everyone out here is really strong.\nI guess I can’t let my guard down just yet!\c\nBut I’m not too worried. No matter who I’m up\nagainst, I’ve got you with me, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000E)]
We’re finally here at the end.\c\nLet’s throw everything we’ve got at our last\nopponents and bowl ’em over![VAR 0114(000E)]
I’ve got to admit, it feels a bit strange teaming\nup together with you like this.\c\nI mean...I’m happy to get to battle alongside\nyou, but you’re just too good. You know?[VAR 0114(000F)]
What did you think of our graceful Water-type\nmoves? I’ve worked to refine them to their\r\npurest form.\c\nI’ll be firing them off from beside you in the next\nmatch, too.[VAR 0114(000F)]
When you and I team up together, there’s no way\nwe can do anything but win.\r\nSo once you’re ready, let’s go and do just that.[VAR 0114(000F)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]! You are both my partner and\nmy rival in this contest!\c\nI will expend my strength as much as I am able to\nat your side—while learning from your example![VAR 0114(0010)]
That last battle raged hotter than even flame.\c\nBut we can’t be reduced to ash just yet.\nWe need to burn even brighter before it’s over![VAR 0114(0010)]
The flames of my strength... They have been\nfanned by your wind, Champion [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nHaving made it this far, there is nowhere left for\nus to go but the very top![VAR 0114(0010)]
Wantin’ to pair up with someone like me...\nI won’t pretend like I know what you’re up to.\c\nDynamaxin’ my Pokémon’s still off the table,\nbut I’ll do whatever else I can in this battle.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I’m not even a Gym Leader anymore or anything.\nBut thanks to you, it seems like I’m still gettin’ in\r\nplenty of tough battles, huh?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Well. Looks like we made it all the way to\nthe end.\c\nSo what? Nothing to worry about.\nThis’ll be a walk in the park for you and me.[VAR 0114(0016)]
This...is...brilliant! You and me, kid... We’re\ngonna be the greatest tag team in history.\c\nI feel a bit sorry for the others. They don’t even\nstand a chance—because we’re sure to win this![VAR 0114(0017)]
Anyone facing off against the great Raihan and\n[VAR 0100(0000)] is done for!\c\nAnd no need to worry—I’m recording the whole\nthing with my Rotom Phone to post later.\c\nSpeaking of which... Try to smile a bit more in\nthe next match, would you?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Naturally we blew right past the second round!\c\nYou really are something, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nThere aren’t many who can keep up with me.\c\nWhen we win, we’ve definitely got to snag a\nsweet selfie together to commemorate this![VAR 0114(0017)]
Thank you very much for inviting me to join you.\c\nI will use all my skill to try to live up to your\nexpectations, so let us begin at once.[VAR 0114(0011)]
One has to be careful not to let a single victory\nlull oneself into complacency.\c\nBut at the same time, being able to battle with\nyou... It feels so right and...comfortable.[VAR 0114(0011)]
We finally face our greatest challenge, which will\ndecide whether we taste victory or defeat.\c\nLet us do our best to align our moves and attacks\neven better than we ever have before![VAR 0114(0011)]
You may be the Champion and all, but I don’t\nplan to sit back and let that decide this match.\c\nI’m going to show everyone the brilliance of the\nRock type—in that sense, I’ll even beat you.[VAR 0114(0014)]
That last battle... Well, you conducted yourself\njust as I would have expected, Champion.\c\nIf you hadn’t, you wouldn’t have been worthy as\nmy partner.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Hah... So we come to the end at last.\c\nBe careful you don’t slip up. All it takes is one\npitfall for a battle to end in disaster.\r\nLet’s finish this up before it comes to that.[VAR 0114(0014)]
A...are you really sure you wanted m-me to be\nyour partner?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Umm... Let’s...er...let’s do it again![VAR 0114(0012)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nL...\nL...\r\nLet’s win this tourney![VAR 0114(0012)]
Looks like someone needs to chill. You want the\npower of my ice to slide to victory?\c\nDon’t worry—we’ll have these weak opponents\ntrembling before us![VAR 0114(0015)]
Just what I expected of you, Champion!\nThis is going to be fun, battling with you.\c\nLet’s bring the temperature down even lower.\nI won’t lose here, so take care you don’t freeze![VAR 0114(0015)]
You’ve done well, battling so many times in a\nrow. One more match till we win the whole\r\nthing! You sure you have it in you?\c\nI won’t let you live it down if you drop the ball\nbecause you’re too tired![VAR 0114(0015)]
Well, well, well, well, WELL!\nYoung M[VAR 1100(00FF,0205)]asters. [VAR 0100(0000)]!\r\nWhat an honor to have been chosen by you.\r\nI am gratitude personified, as you can\r\nsurely see!\c\nAnyone fool enough to take on a pair of\ncelebrities such as ourselves shall soon be\r\ntasting our dust as we outstrip them![VAR 0114(0068)]
How very like you, your glorious Champion-ness!\nNo matter where you go, there are none who\r\ncan stand up to your majesty!\c\nI wonder whether my earnest but incomparable\nteam has been any help to you at all.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Only one step remains for us to take before\nvictory lies within our hands!\c\nWhen you consider yourself ready, let us bring\nthis tournament to a glorious finale![VAR 0114(0068)]
Well, well, well, well, WELL!\nYoung M[VAR 1100(00FF,0205)]asters. [VAR 0100(0000)]!\r\nIt is an honor to have been chosen by you.\r\nI am terribly indebted to you for this boon.\c\nJust you wait and see—I will prove to you that I\nam just as capable a battler even when not\r\npaired with my older brother!\c\nBecause that is what a true celebrity does![VAR 0114(0069)]
I am all aflutter with delight at being able to\nshare such a victory with you, young\r\nM[VAR 1100(00FF,0205)]asters. [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nIt seems it was worth all the training we put in as\nwe toured the region apologizing for our\r\ncelebrity-scale misdeeds![VAR 0114(0069)]
The final round is all that awaits us now!\nOur victory is practically assured!\c\nFate has made us a sweet promise, and she surely\nwill not betray us now!\c\nIt will pain my heart slightly to seize a victory\nsuch as none my older brother shall ever\r\ngrasp...yet a true celebrity never lets such\r\nfeelings show![VAR 0114(0069)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]!\nThanks for calling me, mate.\c\nI know I’ve been spending all my days hitting the\nbooks, but I think it’s actually taught me more\r\nabout battling, too!\c\nLet’s make this a tournament that’ll bring smiles\nof delight to everyone’s faces![VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s our Champion of Galar for you!\c\nYou’ve gotten even stronger since the last time\nwe battled, haven’t you?\c\nTo think that I got to learn and battle alongside\nsomeone like you, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nIt’s really been the best thing in my life, and\nnothing makes me prouder.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Here we are at the final round!\c\nI’ll wring out every bit of strength I’ve got in me.\c\nAfter all, it wouldn’t do to be the one to blame\nfor making Champion [VAR 0100(0000)] lose![VAR 0114(0005)]
I don’t have any intention of outstaying my\nwelcome, you understand.\c\nBut if you young ones insist that you need my\nhelp, then I can hardly ignore your pleas.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Yes, yes, well done.\nYou seem to be coming along quite well.\c\nYou’re precisely what I’ve come to expect in a\nChampion—even if you are sadly lacking in pink.\r\nLet’s keep it up, and we’ll reach the top.[VAR 0114(0013)]
It’s obviously no fluke that you managed to\ndefeat that young Leon.\c\nEven partnering up with a retired old woman like\nmyself isn’t slowing you down, is it?\c\nWin this whole thing, and I’ll even offer you my\nheartfelt congratulations.[VAR 0114(0013)]

Fugaaa! Fugagaga!\c\nI’m a Pokémon! Have a battle with me!
Listen for a second.\c\nScorbunny and Sizzlipede are different species,\nbut they’re still both Pokémon.\c\nScorbunny and I are different species, just like\nSizzlipede and I are different, too.\c\nIf you think about it that way, there’s no problem\nwith calling me a Pokémon. I don’t mind.
What? You don’t have to worry about me.\nEven I know it’s pretty lofty logic.\c\nI...I wanted to become a Pokémon once.
You can be one
Well...good luck with that
Hey, I’ve got it! A change of fashion style could\nchange the way I feel, too!\c\nBasically, if I can make myself feel the way a\nPokémon does, it’d be like I became a Pokémon,\r\ndon’t you think?
You! Would you please put on some clothes with\na fiery spirit that embodies my burning feelings?
I appreciate you encouraging me, but I can’t\nfeel like a Pokémon that way.\c\nPlease! Show me some clothes with a\nFire-type design!
What’s this? Is that...? I feel like I’ve completely\nbecome a Pokémon.\c\nWearing a hot, fire-styled outfit can make\nyou feel different. I feel like I’ve become a\r\nFire-type Pokémon!
Thanks for cheering me up! It’s hardly a proper\nreward, but I hope you like it anyway.\c\nAcrobatics is a move that does more damage if\nthe user isn’t holding an item!
I’ve been thinking... If a Cramorant swallowed me,\nand then someone else caught it...\c\nWould I be able to go inside the Poké Ball, too?\nIf I did, I’d be the first person in humanity’s history\r\nto be caught by a Poké Ball.\c\n“Gotcha! A man was caught!” They’d have to say\nsomething like that, right?\c\nBasically that means I’d equal a Pokémon, no?\nYeah. Yeah, definitely “no.”

[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], you look a little more\nChampion-like, huh? Only a little, though.[VAR 0114(000D)]
What’re you gawkin’ at? It’s exactly what you\nthink. I look wicked as a Gym Leader, right?[VAR 0114(000D)]
I wanna show everyone that even if you can’t\nDynamax, you can still use other tactics\r\nand have a lot of fun![VAR 0114(000D)]
C’mon, Champ! How ’bout an exhibition match?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Of course!
Now’s not a good time
Don’t get the wrong idea! This ain’t you usin’ me\nfor trainin’. I’m usin’ you for trainin’—got it?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Sure, that’s it. Spikemuth’s my home turf, after\nall. It’s only natural you’d feel nervous.[VAR 0114(000D)]
As expected. You’re a proper Champion,\nain’tcha, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000D)]
OK! I’m gonna give you somethin’ important.\nSo keep it safe or I’ll get mad, got it?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Come back any time you’re free. I don’t mind\ntrainin’ against you.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Just couldn’t stay away, eh, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nGuess it can’t be helped. Shall I beat you hollow?[VAR 0114(000D)]
If I’m not good enough to beat you yet, that\nmeans I definitely can’t go sayin’ I’ve surpassed\r\nmy bro![VAR 0114(000D)]
Battling the Champion sure is excitin’!\nBe sure to come back again, OK?\r\nMorpeko and I will be waitin’.[VAR 0114(000D)]

A treasure lies buried somewhere in Turffield...
According to this treasure map, the trick to\nfinding the treasure lies in the standing stones.\c\n“Seek yourself three standing stones,\nwith Grass before the other ones.\r\nUse well that strength, and find then\r\nthe strength of its strength in the end.\r\nDally not, if you’ve a mind\r\nTo find what time has left behind.”\c\n...That’s what it says, but I can’t make heads or\ntails of it!
What?! You actually managed to find treasure?!\nThat’s amazing! I was completely stuck!
What’s this? Something’s carved into the stone.\nIt says: “Grass.”
What’s this? Something’s carved into the stone.\nIt says: “Water.”
What’s this? Something’s carved into the stone.\nIt says: “Fire.”
What’s this? Something’s carved into the stone.\nIt says: “Flying.”
What’s this? Something’s carved into the stone.\nIt says: “Poison.”
What’s this? Something’s carved into the stone.\nIt says: “Dark.”
There’s something buried in the ground!

[VAR 0103(0001)]-type moves are super effective\nagainst which type of Pokémon?
[VAR 0103(0002)]
Ding ding ding! Right answer!
Bzzzzzz! That’s incorrect!
The next question!
Please try again.
You got [VAR 0200(0004)] out of [VAR 0200(0003)] question[VAR 1101(0003,0100)]s right!
You understand Pokémon type matchups\nvery well!
You have some understanding about Pokémon\ntype matchups.
You may want to learn about Pokémon type\nmatchups a little bit more...
You got them all correct for the first time.\nSo I’ll give you a present!

Oho... I see you’ve become the Champion.\nThen I can now have your Lv. 100 Pokémon\r\nundergo Hyper Training.
What’s this? Seems you don’t have any\nBottle Caps or Gold Bottle Caps.
Now, which Pokémon will I have undergo\nHyper Training?
If it isn’t Lv. 100, it’s not hype enough to\nundergo Hyper Training.
Oh! [VAR 0102(0001)] is already so strong, it\ndoesn’t even need any training!
Would you like to use a Bottle Cap or a\nGold Bottle Cap?
You want me to hype up all of this Pokémon’s stats?
Which stat should I hype up?
[VAR 0109(0000)]: [VAR 0201(0001)]
Quit
The training starts now!
This Pokémon can’t be trained any further!
You don’t have enough [VAR 1001][VAR 010A(0000)]...
Phew... [VAR 0102(0000)] got stronger from the\nHyper Training.
Want to keep the hype going with some more\nHyper Training?
Shall I stop the Hyper Training?
Come back when you’re ready to get hyped for\nsome Hyper Training.

Hee hee hee!\nThis month’s birthday horoscope is spot on!
Hmmm? Do you want me to tell you your\nfortune, too?
OK! In that case, can you tell me the month\nyou were born?
Next, I need to know what day you were born!
Oh, OK!\nWell, let me know if you change your mind!
I got it!
So your birthday is [VAR 0201(0001)]/[VAR 0201(0002)]?
Everyone makes mistakes once in a while!\nJust tell me one more time!

Congratulations, Champion. Here, I’ve got a\nlittle something for you as celebration.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Professor Magnolia!\nWhy, you didn’t have to come all this way![VAR 0114(0008)]
After everything [VAR 0100(0000)] has achieved,\nit’s really the least I could do.[VAR 0114(000A)]
The Wishing Stars that make Dynamaxing\npossible are parts of Eternatus.\c\nAnd when Eternatus was awakened, Dynamax\nenergy flooded the entire region...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Because of that, Dynamax Pokémon were\npopping up all over, causing trouble across all\r\nof Galar.\c\nBut [VAR 0100(0000)] and h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser friends came to\nour rescue.[VAR 0114(000A)]
The Dynamax phenomenon has long been an\nimportant part of Galarian culture.\c\nI hope everyone will use the power of\nDynamaxing correctly in the days to come.[VAR 0114(000A)]
So, young [VAR 0100(0000)].\nPlease, do what you believe is best.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Poor Professor Magnolia...\c\nIt seems she’s quite bothered by the chairman’s\nactions, since she helped carry out so much of\r\nthe researching into Dynamaxing for him.[VAR 0114(0008)]

You’re not interested in Rotom...?\nReally? Do such people even exist...?
Prepare to be confounded by all the various\nforms of my dear Rotom!
You defeated every one of my Rotom...\nYou should be able to put this catalog to\r\ngood use!
If you use the Rotom Catalog, it will let Rotom\nenter all sorts of home appliances!\r\nOh, and of course, Rotom can get out again.

Evolution is a bit tricky for Pokémon Trainers...\c\nIf a Pokémon evolves, it’ll get stronger, but its\nappearance will change.\c\nDo you want to know how to make your\nPokémon strong without it evolving?
Oh, that’s too bad.\nIf you change your mind, please come back.
OK. I’ll teach you while battling!\nLet’s have a Pokémon battle!
Even though my Dottler hasn’t evolved yet,\nit was hard to take down, wasn’t it?\r\nThe secret is this Eviolite!
If you let a Pokémon that can still evolve hold\nthis Eviolite, that Pokémon’s Defense and Sp. Def\r\nwill go up!

Why, hello there, young man.\nAre you interested in weather?
Why, hello there, young lady.\nAre you interested in weather?
Oh, is that so!\nWell then, let me get started...
If the sunlight is harsh during battle...
Fire-type moves become more powerful,\nwhile Water-type moves are weakened!
The sunlight will thaw out any frozen Pokémon,\nand they’ll be immune to being frozen while\r\nthe weather lasts, too!
Moves that use light, like Solar Beam, can be\nperformed in one turn!
The effects of some other moves also get\nenhanced, like those of Growth and Synthesis.
Certain moves, like Thunder or Hurricane,\nbecome less accurate.
If it’s raining during battle...
Water-type moves will become more powerful,\nwhile Fire-type moves get weakened!
Moves that use sunlight, like Solar Beam, also\nget weakened!
Your Pokémon will heal less HP when they use\nmoves like Synthesis or Morning Sun, too.
On the other hand, moves like Thunder or\nHurricane will become sure hits!
If it’s hailing during battle...
any Pokémon that’s not Ice type will take\ndamage every turn!
Moves that use sunlight, like Solar Beam, will\nget weakened!
Your Pokémon will heal less HP when they use\nmoves like Synthesis or Morning Sun, too.
On the other hand, the move Blizzard will\nbecome a sure hit.
If a sandstorm is raging during battle...
Rock-type Pokémon get a boost to their Sp. Def!
Any Pokémon that’s not Rock, Ground, or Steel\ntype will take damage every turn!
Moves that use sunlight, like Solar Beam, will\nget weakened!
Your Pokémon will heal less HP when they use\nmoves like Synthesis or Morning Sun, too.
Whew!\nI got a little carried away there!
Thanks for listening so politely.\nPlease, take this!
You’re the first one to listen to everything I had\nto say about weather...\c\nHere’s a little something extra, just as a\nthank-you!

I just want to be let go soon...
Where did my Pokémon go off to...?
*cough*\nI suppose I should introduce myself.[VAR 0114(0042)]
The name’s Howses. Yes, THAT Howses—the\ngreat detective. I’ve been hired by the hotel.[VAR 0114(006D)]
At present I have cornered the culprit of a most\nheinous crime.[VAR 0114(006D)]
And that crime is...[VAR 0114(006D)]
the strange case of who ate the large quantity of\nBerries in the lobby![VAR 0114(006D)]
I’ve gathered the three people who were\npresent in the lobby at the time of the crime...[VAR 0114(006D)]
But because of the noise, my marvelous\ndeductive reasoning seems somewhat muddled\r\nat present...[VAR 0114(006D)]
That’s it! You, interfering child! You will be\nmy assistant![VAR 0114(006D)]
Listen to the stories of each suspect, and find\nthe culprit![VAR 0114(006D)]
Looks like you were unlucky enough to get\ncaught up in this, too...
It was a huge pile of Berries in the lobby, right?\nThere’s no way I could’ve eaten that many.\r\nI’ve been saying that this whole time.
That detective sure seems like trouble,\ndoesn’t he?
I will admit that I saw the mountain of Berries, but\nmy doctor told me to stop eating those things.\r\nI’ve got it in writing right here.
*sigh*\nWhere did my Pokémon go off to...?
Huh? Berries? I didn’t eat them. Hey, you haven’t\nseen my Pokémon around here, have you?
Chewww!
Ah! My Pokémon! Where were you?
Muuunch.
It sure has a lot of Berry juice on its mouth...
Heh heh heh...[VAR 0114(006D)]
After listening to everyone’s accounts, I have\ndeduced the culprit.[VAR 0114(006D)]
Dancer! You are the culprit![VAR 0114(006D)]
What? Why me?
Because you’re a dancer! You move and shake\nyour body so much that you needed all that\r\nfood for extra energy![VAR 0114(006D)]
That’s evidence as clear and sharp as the leek\nof a Farfetch’d![VAR 0114(006D)]
What? What does that even mean? You’re no\ndetective—you’re a fraud!
Wh-who are you calling a fraud?! You can’t be\nreferring to me, the great detective![VAR 0114(006D)]
I can’t deal with this disrespect! I leave it to you!\nYou find the culprit!
*gasp*[VAR 0114(006D)]
Fraud detective... It’s so cruel, I might cry...[VAR 0114(006D)]
You think I’m the criminal, too?!
You’re a fraud, too! A fraud assistant to a\nfraud detective!
Good, you get it.
What? You think I’m the culprit?
Sorry, but you’re totally wrong. I’ll do you a favor\nand keep that a secret. Let’s pretend that didn’t\r\njust happen, OK?
I can’t eat Berries, after all.
Wha?! You think I’m the culprit?
You’re wrong! Think things over more carefully!
Oh!
Cromch?
Could this be the culprit?
Munch...
What? That Skwovet is the one responsible?[VAR 0114(006D)]
Muuunch?
Ah, it’s true! It’s got Berry bits around its mouth!
Oh, you’re right. I see it now that I look\nmore closely.
Yes, it definitely ate the Berries. Definitely...
Muuuncha.
As...[VAR 0114(006D)]
As... As expected of my assistant![VAR 0114(006D)]
Here! Recompense for solving this mystery!\nTake it![VAR 0114(006D)]
Splendid, just splendid! I’m overjoyed![VAR 0114(006D)]
I must be off now. Take care, everyone![VAR 0114(006D)]
Hey, you! Wait just a minute!
Hahaha! I guess I’m supposed to chase after\nhim, too.

Oh, right...\nSorry for asking such a strange thing of you...

Finding your way through Glimwood Tangle is a\nfair sight easier if you give the mushrooms a li’l\r\nnudge to light them up.
Every time I meet granny Opal, she tells me\nI should wear more pink, the old bat.
My grandda seems to have a bit more spring in\nhis step lately.\c\nThanks for bringing whatever was in that letter!
Thank you...for delivering the letter...

Ta-da!\c\nYou took the time to talk to a Poké Ball, so\nyou deserve a little reward!
In case you were wondering, I’m not just any old\nPoké Ball!\c\nBut then who am I, you ask? Well, the answer is\nsimple. They call me the Ball Guy!
I’ll be rolling around stadiums here and there, so\nif you see me, don’t be shy! Come up and say hi!
Hi there, Champion!\nI’ve been waiting for you!
If I can become mates with the Champion,\nthen maybe I can finally become the official\r\nmascot of the Gym Challenge...
Oh, before I forget! You were able to become\nChampion thanks to my cheers, right?\c\nSo, here’s something to make sure you don’t\nforget your old friend Ball Guy!
A super-rare League Card!\c\nYou’ll be the envy of every collector out there,\nI promise you!
Don’t worry about the card’s slight wrinkling.\nThat’s just because everyone tried to get their\r\nhands on it!\c\nI know it looks like a common one, but mark my\nwords—it’s a true treasure of a League Card!
Hello there! It’s your good friend Ball Guy!\c\nDon’t you worry—I’ll always make sure every\nGym Challenger has a ball! It’s my duty as the\r\nvolunteer mascot of the Gym Challenge!

I noticed something shiny on the ground while I\nwas wandering the Wild Area, and so I went to\r\ninvestigate. Guess what I found?\c\nStar Pieces! A whole bunch of them!\nHere, you can have one, too!
You can sell Star Pieces for a good price\nat the Poké Marts.\c\nI’ve got my eye on some new clothes and a new\nhat already!

Oh! Look at you!\nDefeated Stow-on-Side’s Gym Leader, eh?\c\nYou’d probably know your way around a TM like\nthis one in that case.
Having your Pokémon learn moves of different\ntypes can be a real help, you know.

Ahhh...\c\nMy delivery guy caught a cold and can’t make\nit today.
You’re the one who dined here with Chairman\nRose, right?\c\nWould you please help us deliver some food?
Oh, sorry for asking something so strange.
Thank you!\nI truly appreciate it!
As for where to deliver the food...\nSorry, I forgot to ask for an address.
I heard a clickety-clack sound from the phone.\nMaybe that’s a clue as to where to go?
Thanks for delivering the food.\nHere—something for your trouble.
Come back sometime for more work!
Back again?\c\nI wanted to ask you to deliver some food again.\nIs that OK?
I don’t know if this helps, but I think I heard\na Pokémon cry over the phone. Like...
The customer told me to look for a green roof,\nbut I wonder if there is such a house in Hulbury.
Thank you for taking care of all the deliveries.\nYou really helped us out.
This is a little token of my gratitude.\nPlease take it.
Welcome!\c\nOh, it’s you. Please relax and stay as long as\nyou’d like.
Oh, are you delivering my food?\nThank you for your trouble!\c\nThis restaurant’s dishes are full of seafood\nand so delicious!
I’ve already paid the restaurant, so I’ll give\nyou candy as a tip!
For someone so young, you sure are\na hard worker!
Ah! I’m starving!\c\nOh, I can smell the ocean.\nYou’re from the restaurant, aren’t you?\c\nI’ve been drooling while waiting for the food!\nThank you for delivering the food!
You get energy from food!\nYou should eat balanced meals!
You’re delivering food?\nWell, hey! I’m the one who ordered it!\c\nThe tail curry of this restaurant has\na unique flavor. I love it!\c\nSay hi to the manager for me!
It was easy to spot the green roof, wasn’t it?
Swiiirl.
You received the ordered food.
You handed over the ordered food.

Psst. Hey, you. You heard the rumor?
I have
I haven’t
Y-you have, huh? I mean, I don’t really care\nor anything...
What? You haven’t heard?!
There’s a rumor that if you give the one you like\nan Applin, you’ll be together forever!
Actually, the truth is, there’s someone I like.
She’s gonna move overseas pretty soon...
I’ve been searching for an Applin so I can\nget my feelings across the right way.\c\nBut I can’t find one...
If you’ve got an Applin, would you please\ngive it to me?
Oh, OK... Sorry to ask for something so weird.\nGuess I’ll look a little more on my own.
Whoa! You mean you’ll really give me\nan Applin?
[VAR 0100(0000)] handed over Applin!
Wow! I did it! I finally got an Applin!
Thank you! Thank you so much!
Since you went through the trouble of giving me\nan Applin...
I’ve got to tell her how I feel!
Sorry I’m late. What was it that you needed to\ntalk about so suddenly?
I... Err... H-how’s your packing going?
Pretty much everything’s been packed.
Since I’m moving away tomorrow...
Yeah...
H-hey! Check out this Pokémon!
Oh, an Applin! Amazing! Did you catch it?
W-well...
N-no. Someone gave it to me.
I’m sorry! I really wanted to give you an Applin\nthat I caught on my own! But, well...
Ah, just forget it! I can’t give you this Applin.
You’re right. I can’t take it.
Yeah...
Even if we’re separated and far away from\neach other...
I’ll still be waiting...for an Applin you\ncaught yourself.
Wait—do you mean...?
Ah, um... I’ll, uh—I’ll see you later!
Say, what do you think that was about, just now?\nDo you think it meant that...?
Good on you!
Congratulations!
Th-thank you?
Wait! Does that mean what I think it means?!
Really, really?! I can’t believe it! Woo-hoo!
Ah, sorry! I just never thought that we both felt\nthe same way.
Right, well, I’d better give this Pokémon back\nto you.
You got back your Applin!
Here, take this, too. Think of it as a reward for\nhelping me take that first step.
I’m going to catch an Applin all by myself!
And then, someday, I’m going to go give her\nthat Applin!
Yeah! I’d better get searching for an Applin!
Thanks again, mate. See ya!
Uh... I appreciate you wanting to help me out,\nbut maybe you should make sure you actually\r\nhave an Applin?

Guess it really doesn’t work until Type: Null\nevolves. Drat...
Oh, Champion [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nIt probably goes without saying at this point, but\ncongratulations on your victory!
To commemorate your achievements, I present\nyou with this rare Pokémon—Type: Null!
Ah, and these, too.
[VAR 0100(0000)] received memories!
Once Type: Null evolves, its type will change\ndepending on which memory you have it hold.
Ah, Champion! Are you taking good care of\nType: Null?

Can I help?
I don’t have time to help right now...
Waaaaaaaaah!
Huh? You’ll help me look for Minccino?\nOh, thank you so much!
My Minccino really likes to play in the water,\nand it also likes the sound of whistling!\c\nI bet it’s hiding somewhere where there’s lots\nof water.\c\nBut I can’t think of a place with lots of water here\nin Motostoke...\c\nIt has a weird cry that sounds like “Mworp,” so\nif you hear that cry, try whistling!
[~ 6]
Mworp...?
It’s the missing Minccino!
Minccino went back to the boy.
[~ 10]
Minccino?\nNo, I’m just an old man.
I come here secretly to freshen up, but I guess\nI’ve finally been found out!
Let me give you a little something to remember\nour meeting!
Now then, I must be on my way!\nFarewell! Ha ha ha ha!
The man went home!
That’s my Minccino!
Minccino came back!\nThanks for helping me find it!
Please take this.\nIt’s my way of saying thank you!
Minccino is my best friend. But it’s so full of\nenergy, I can’t take my eyes off of it!

Name’s Cara Liss. I am researching Fossils, huh.
Fossils in Galar are broken into top halves and\nbottom halves for some reason, huh.\c\nStrangely, no matter which top and bottom you\ncombine, they can be restored together.\c\nPerhaps, within this mystery, lies the key to\nunderstanding these combinable Pokémon, huh.
Hm? You’ve got some Fossils there, huh.\nWill you show them to me, Cara Liss?
Don’t act so haughty.
Which of your Fossils do you think stands up to\nthe high standards of Cara Liss?
Which of your Fossils do you think will pique\nthe curiosity of Cara Liss?
Fossilized Bird
Fossilized Fish
Fossilized Drake
Fossilized Dino

So I should restore the [VAR 0109(0001)]\nand the [VAR 0109(0002)] together, huh?
Yes, please
I want to try something else
Quit
OK. Restoration time. Let’s unravel the mystery\nof these Fossils!
All right, I’ll stick ’em together! Here...we...GO!
Objective complete. It seems the restoration was\na great success.\c\nYes, I can see it in its eyes. This is a Pokémon\nthat walked the face of Galar in ancient times!\r\nPlease take and care for this Pokémon, huh.
Looks like there’s no room in your Boxes, huh.

Maybe you’re a bit too strict?\nIt doesn’t seem like you’re friends at all...
I guess you two just met?\nIt’s still getting used to things.
Seems like it likes you an average amount!\nDon’t worry—you two will get closer as\r\ntime passes!
Wow, I think you’re on your way to becoming\nreal good friends!
Seems like you’re pretty good friends!\nStill, I bet you could become even closer!
You two get along great!\nTogether is always better—am I right?
You two are almost best friends!\nI can see you really care about each other!
Oh wow, you’re best buddies!\nI can tell you’re so happy to be together!
Here, I’ll give you this as a sign of\nyour friendship!

Hello there? What’s this?\nDid you need something from me?\c\nRiiight...\c\nWhy don’t you run along for now, but come back\nwhen you’re as strong as a Champion, would you?[VAR 0114(0042)]
Well, blow me over! You’ve become Champion?\nNow, that’s something worth writing home about![VAR 0114(0042)]
The name’s Morimoto.\c\nI’ve been waiting for a strong Trainer like you to\ncome find me.
If you’ve got faith in your own skill, care to join\nme in a match?
Is that so?\nWell, that’s a right shame.
What’s this? Can’t battle if you don’t have at\nleast two healthy Pokémon capable of joining in!
That’s the ticket! Now watch out!\nBecause Morimoto’s got more than enough to\r\nmotor right over you!
You’re really strong!\nI should’ve known!
Since you’ve managed to trounce me, I guess\nyou’ve earned yourself a reward.
Let’s have ourselves a rematch someday!
You seem to keep motoring right over ol’\nMorimoto. Let’s see who wins the next time!
I’m all tuckered out for today.\nHow about tomorrow for a rematch?
And here [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she is!\nReady for that match?
And...go!\c\nAwww, I missed again?!\nIt’s harder than it looks to get a catch!\c\nHmm? You...\c\nYou look like you’d know the proper way to\nthrow a Poké Ball!
I’m a planner!\c\nMy job is think of ways to play, so I suppose that\nmeans that playing itself is my job!
Hear that background music?\nYup, I made that!
We came here to research a bit.\nBut the Galar region is lovely, isn’t it?\c\nThe best part of all had to be enjoying the\ndifferent toppings on all the curries.\r\nCurry is a big hit in Kanto, too, you know!
Do you like Pokémon?
Well, thanks for that!\nI hope you’ll always love them!
Oh, I get it...\nYou don’t just like them. You love them, right?
I’m completely obsessed with Rotom Rally!\nI can’t get enough of it!

Got some Pokémon questions?\nFeel free to ask away.
Undergo Hyper Training
Learn rare moves
Remember a move
Forget a move
Quit
Rate a nickname
Check a Pokémon’s memories
Well, come back anytime.
So, you’re the new Champion!\c\nI can put any of your Lv. 100 Pokémon\nthrough Hyper Training.
What’s this? Seems you don’t have any\nBottle Caps or Gold Bottle Caps.
Now, which Pokémon will I put through\nHyper Training?
If it isn’t Lv. 100, it’s not hype enough to\nundergo Hyper Training.
Oh! [VAR 0102(0001)] is already so strong, it\ndoesn’t even need any training!
Would you like to use a Bottle Cap or a\nGold Bottle Cap?
You want me to hype up all of this Pokémon’s stats?
Which stat should I hype up?

You don’t have enough [VAR 1001][VAR 0109(0000)]...
Phew... [VAR 0102(0000)] got stronger from the\nHyper Training.
Want to keep the hype going with some more\nHyper Training?
What move shall I teach?
Ultimate moves
Battle-combo moves
Quit
Back
Draco Meteor
Frenzy Plant
Hydro Cannon
Blast Burn
Fire Pledge
Water Pledge
Grass Pledge
Which Pokémon should learn my move?
Which Pokémon should I have remember\na move?
Which Pokémon should I have forget a move?
Hm? This move is quite rare. If your Pokémon\nforgets this move, it won’t be able to relearn it.\r\nSo I’ll teach it another rare move for you.
[VAR 0102(0001)] can’t learn my move.
[VAR 0102(0001)] already knows my move.
[VAR 0102(0000)] learned [VAR 0107(0001)]![VAR BE05(0004)][VAR BE05(0001)]
There are rare moves that your Pokémon can’t\nlearn by leveling up or by using TMs or TRs!\c\nIf you’re interested, I can teach them to\nyour Pokémon.
You want one of your Pokémon to forget a\nmove? If you want your Pokémon to use a move\r\nit’s forgotten, it’ll have to relearn the move first.\r\nSo be careful.
I can have your Pokémon remember any move\nthey should’ve had the chance to learn up until\r\nwhere they are now.
It doesn’t seem like that Pokémon has any moves\nthat it can forget.
It doesn’t seem like that Pokémon has any moves\nthat it can remember.
Huh? You can’t choose an Egg! It hasn’t even\nhatched yet!
[VAR 0102(0001)] has already learned the\nspecial move.
Would you like me to teach this move to another\nof your Pokémon?
Is there another Pokémon you’d like me to help\nremember some moves?
Would you like me to have your Pokémon forget\nany other moves?
Shall I stop having your Pokémon forget moves?
Shall I stop having your Pokémon remember moves?
Shall I stop teaching your Pokémon moves?
Shall I stop the Hyper Training?

Which Pokémon’s nickname should I rate\nfor you?
Hmmm. [VAR 0102(0000)], is it?\c\nThat is quite a fine nickname.\c\nBut I think we could give it something even\nbetter. What do you think?
I see! What would you like the new nickname\nto be?
Done! From now on, this Pokémon shall be\nknown as [VAR 0102(0000)]!\c\nYou’re right—that does seem to fit it better.\nNicely done!
[~ 77]
Done! From now on, this Pokémon shall be\nknown as [VAR 0102(0000)]!\c\nIt looks no different from before, but we both\nknow this name is much better!\r\nHow fortunate for you!
Hmmm. [VAR 0102(0000)]!\nThat is a truly impeccable nickname!\r\nI can’t say anything bad about it!\c\nTake good care of [VAR 0102(0000)]!
Now, now...\nThat is merely an Egg.
Or do you want to quit giving the Pokémon a\nnickname and change back to the name that\r\nthe Pokémon had when you two met?
Yes, yes. [VAR 0101(0001)]!\c\nIt reminds you of the time when you first met\nthe Pokémon!\c\nCome see me again if you want to give\nPokémon nicknames.
For a Pokémon you got from another Trainer,\nyou only get one go at changing its name.\c\nIt’ll be [VAR 0102(0000)] from now on and forever.\nSo you’re sure that’s the name you want?
All right.\nLet me know if you change your mind.
Shall I rate another Pokémon’s name?
Which Pokémon’s memories are you interested in?
Somehow I can tell what Pokémon remember.
[VAR 0102(0000)] seems to have memories from\nits time with another Trainer.
Do you want to hear about the memories of any\nother Pokémon?
[VAR 0102(0000)] seems to have a fond memory,\nbut it doesn’t seem to be able to remember\r\nthe details...

Which Pokémon do you want me to teach\nthis move to?
Sorry. [VAR 0102(0001)] can’t learn this move.
An Egg can’t learn this move!

Hey there, Trainer! You’ve just taken your first\nstep into the world of camping!\c\nPeople call me the Camping King!\nI can help you out with all your camping needs.\c\nRemember, everyone starts out as a rookie!\nIf you’ve got any questions about camping, feel\r\nfree to ask me!
Well, well! Today looks like another fine day\nfor camping, I’d say!
Is there anything camping related you’d like\nsome help with?
I want to change my tent color
Rate my Curry Dex, please
I want to change my cooking utensils
Feel free to ask me anything about camping!
I’ll pick out a color that goes well with\nyour Pokémon!
Hmm. Hmm. Yes, I see...\c\nA color that would suit [VAR 0102(0000)]...\nThat’s it! It must be the [VAR 0103(0001)] type’s color!
Oho. Let’s see now...\c\nA color that suits your [VAR 0102(0000)]...\nWhich do you think is a better fit?
Yes
No
[VAR 0103(0000)]-type color
[VAR 0103(0001)]-type color
The [VAR 0103(0000)]-type color? Are you sure?!
I’ve changed your tent to the\n[VAR 0103(0000)]-type color!
Oh? Why, you haven’t made a single dish yet!\c\nCome back after you’ve tried making one, and\nshow me!
You’ve reached the highest heights of curry\ncreation! I have nothing more to teach you!\c\nContinue to strive for curry creation excellence!
How’s your Curry Dex coming along? Allow me\nto have a quick look at it.\c\nLooks like you’ve made [VAR 0202(0001)] kind[VAR 1101(0001,0100)]s of curry!
You’re still a camping rookie!\c\nFor starters, why not try throwing any ingredients\nyou like in the pot and see what comes of it!
Looks like you’re getting the hang of cooking\nwhile out camping.\c\nTry adding in Berries to your curry to give it\na little extra oomph!
With ten curries under your belt, I think you’ve\ngraduated from rookie status!\c\nKeep trying to create all manner of wonderful\ncurries from here on out!
You’ve certainly started making your way down\nthe long road of curry cooking!\c\nBe sure to fan the flames just right, so as not to\nburn the dish. And don’t spill anything when\r\nstirring the pot!
Oh! Why, you’ve made at least thirty different\nkinds of curry!\c\nI can feel the curry creation potential radiating\nfrom you!\c\nKeep doing your best to aim for higher and\nhigher heights!
Seems like making curry has become a common\npart of your everyday life by now, right?\c\nRemember you can always buy more ingredients,\nas well as find them lying on the ground!\c\nGather as many different ingredients as you can\nand make all different kinds of curry!
You stand now among the curry cooking elite!\c\nYou probably already know this, but if you cook\nin someone else’s camp, there’s a chance you’ll\r\nbe able to use an ingredient that wasn’t in\r\nyour Bag!
That look on your face! That faint fragrance of\nsome spice!\c\nYou’ve become a truly splendid curry chef!\c\nI bet there are times you look through your\nCurry Dex and relive all the memories that\r\nfill it!
You’ve made every single curry I know of?!\nAmazing...simply amazing!\c\nYou may very well complete your Curry Dex\nbefore even I do!
Oh? Oh?! Could this be? Can this truly be?!\c\nYou’ve...you’ve completed your Curry Dex!\nYou’ve made every known curry in this world\r\nto date!\c\nTo have come so far in your camp cooking...\nI’m touched! Truly touched! Thank you!
Since you’ve made at least [VAR 0202(0000)] different\nkind[VAR 1101(0000,0100)]s of curry, how about a reward?
You put [VAR 1300(0001,0000)][VAR 010A(0001)]\naway in your Camping Gear.
You put the Fresh Ball away in your\nCamping Gear.
You put the Weighted Ball away in your\nCamping Gear.
You put the Soothe Ball away in your\nCamping Gear.
You put the Mirror Ball away in your\nCamping Gear.
You put the Tympole Ball away in your\nCamping Gear.

Sausages are a staple topping! Be sure to try\ncooking with them!
This Fresh Ball is a new kind of Poké Ball I’ve\ndeveloped... Nah, I’m just having a laugh!\c\nIt’s a toy you can use to play with your Pokémon\nwhile camping.\c\nIt’s the spitting image of a Watmel Berry, and it’s\nquite heavy, too. You might have a little difficulty\r\nthrowing it!
Remember, a Heavy Ball is what you use to\ncatch Pokémon!\c\nThis might look similar, but it’s a Weighted Ball...\nIt’s just a toy!\c\nIt makes a real heavy sound as it bounces! Try\nplaying with it when camping with your Pokémon!
The Soothe Ball makes a sound like a bell\nwhen you throw it!\c\nTry throwing it when you’re camping with your\nPokémon to calm everyone’s hearts!
The Mirror Ball is ultra-reflective and the\npinnacle of funkiness!\c\nTry throwing it when you’re camping with your\nPokémon to get everyone pumped up!
The Tympole Ball looks like...well...Tympole.\c\nYou can hear Tympole’s cute cry when the ball\nbounces on the ground!
The Champion Ball is a kind of gag gift with\nLeon’s face on it!\c\nTry throwing it when you’re camping with\nyour Pokémon. Leon’s face will fly far\r\nand bounce with some impressive oomph!
Moomoo Cheese melts in a curry and makes a\ndish taste even better!\c\nCooking with it will also help you add some new\nentries to your Curry Dex. So try using this\r\ningredient next time you cook!
Everyone knows Slowpoke Tails are a delicacy!\nThey fall off all the time and grow back quickly,\r\nso they’ve become a popular cooking ingredient!\c\nAdding it to a curry is sure to create a taste that\nyou’ll fall in love with!
Ah, another thing...
Thank you for completing your Curry Dex!\c\nYou’ve truly accomplished something marvelous!\nAnd such a cook deserves an appropriate set\r\nof cooking utensils. Please take these!
You received the golden cooking utensils!
You’re using the golden cooking utensils right\nnow. Would you like to change back to the\r\nnormal ones?
You’re using normal cooking utensils right now.\nWould you like to change to the golden ones?
You changed to the normal cooking utensils!

No, thanks
All right, then we’ll leave your tent as its\ncurrent color!
All right! We’ll leave things as they are!
Hm? Your tent is already the\n[VAR 0103(0000)]-type color.
First, I’ll tell you about the mysterious dish\ncalled curry. Everyone in Galar has been hooked\r\non it!\c\nTo start, you need to mix in a Berry to make the\ncurry! Then you cover a grain called “rice” in it!\c\nAnd there you have it! It’s quite literally curry\nwith rice!\c\nBut wait!\c\nThere are ingredients that you can add to the\ndish, like toppings to better suit your tastes!\c\nYou can make all sorts of magnificent curries\nwhile you’re camping!\c\nAnd whenever you make a new kind of curry, it’ll\nbe automatically saved in your Curry Dex! So try\r\nmaking all manner of different curry recipes!
You got the Fresh Ball!
You got the Weighted Ball!
You got the Soothe Ball!
You got the Mirror Ball!
You got the Tympole Ball!
You got the Champion Ball!

The clothes I like the best aren’t necessarily the\nmost flattering. It’s a real struggle.
I’m looking for something that’ll make me stand\nout even in a vast Wild Area.

Gym Leader Kabu has a great uniform number.\nThe 187 just looks so cool!

A Gym Challenger!\c\nAh, but if you want to battle our Leader Kabu,\nyou’ll need to have earned a Grass Badge in\r\nTurffield and a Water Badge in Hulbury first!
A Gym Challenger!\nAnd you’ve even earned your first two Badges!\c\nBut I’m afraid our Leader Kabu has gone off to\nGalar Mine No. 2 to undergo some special\r\ntraining with his team.\c\nYou might want to head there to try to catch him.
Oh? A bit late for challenging the Gym tonight,\nwouldn’t you say? Come again tomorrow.\c\nIf you need a place to pass the night, all Gym\nChallengers can stay at the Budew Drop Inn.
Let’s all do our utmost as Gym Challengers.
First stop will be Turffield, eh?\nI’m off for Route 3 myself!
I’ve made it this far, at least...\nBut now I’m not sure I can make it any further.\r\nCan I really beat the Fire Gym? I don’t know...
Your Pokémon really got stuck in and did [VAR 1101(00FD,0503)]itstheir\nbest for you, didn’t [VAR 1101(00FD,0402)]itthey...\c\nWhen I watched your match, I was the one who\nended up feeling fired up to carry on!
The opening ceremony of the Gym Challenge...\nMy whole family’ll be watching back home...\c\nI should go check my hair once more in the\nmirror, don’t you think?
Getting to see Chairman Rose address us all\nlike that... I’ve never been so fired up in my life!
I got the Grass Badge and the Water Badge...\nBut can I really get a Fire Badge?
You beat that Kabu fellow?!\nYou really are a great Trainer...\c\nAt this rate, I bet the other Gym Challengers\nwill start wanting to test their mettle against you.
I heard that this year’s Gym Challengers include\nTrainers that were endorsed by the chairman and\r\neven the Champion!
Collecting all eight Gym Badges...\nIt feels a bit like a treasure hunt, doesn’t it?\c\nI wonder how hard the battles will be against\nthe Gym Leaders, though.
You’re one of those Gym Challengers that were\nendorsed by Leon, right?\c\nNo wonder you’re up to taking on Kabu.
That’s Leon for you, isn’t it...\c\nHe must’ve seen at a glance how much potential\nyou had, and that’s why he chose to endorse you.
I’m dead nervous, and this is only the opening\nceremony... What’s the matter with me?!\c\nMy Pokémon all seem to be aching to battle,\nso why can’t I seem to feel the same way...?
I got to stand on the pitch in a stadium, just like\nI’ve always dreamed of doing...\c\nNext up, I’ll be battling on that pitch! No!\nWinning on that pitch—as the crowd goes wild!
There are heaps of us starting out like this,\nbut only a small number will make it to the end...
Just seeing the Champion is a dream come true.\nBut my real dream ought to be to defeat him!
Finally, the time’s come for\nanother Gym Challenge!
Time to train up my\nteam out on Route 3!
I’m ready for that Fire\nGym Leader Kabu!
We’re not done yet.\nLet’s give it our all!
Everyone’s already nervous.\nWill we make it to the end?
I’m going to make it to the\nend of this—just you watch!
There are still a number of\nchallengers in the running!
That Gym Challenger’s done\nbetter than I ever dreamed!
Hmm. So everyone here is\na fellow Gym Challenger...
Everyone’s going to be\ncompeting to win this.

“Regarding the Changes Pokémon Can Undergo”\nPokémon do not only change in appearance\nwhen they level up. They can also do so through\nthe use of certain items or under the influence of\nthe area they are in, in some cases.\c\nIt is hypothesized that some factor within the\nPokémon itself is what allows for these changes\nto their form and biology, but thus far, conclusive\nevidence of such a factor has not been found\nby researchers.
“What Is the Dynamax Phenomenon?”\nThis phenomenon, in which Pokémon take on\ngigantic forms, has only been observed in the\nGalar region. Moreover, it only seems to occur\nin specific locations and under set conditions.
“On the Gigantification of Pokémon”\nWhile the general principal holds that Pokémon\ngrow stronger and larger by evolving, it is also\ntrue that simply making oneself appear larger\nis another survival strategy with merit.

Is this your first visit to the Isle of Armor?
I’m researching Pokémon biology here on\nthis island.
You want to register the Pokémon you catch on\nthis island to your Pokédex, right?
I’ll update your Pokédex so you can do\njust that.
Your Pokédex is being updated...\c\n... ... ...\n... ... ...
The Isle of Armor Pokédex has been added to\nyour Pokédex!
When you’ve caught a lot of Pokémon on\nthe Isle of Armor, come back and\r\nshow me your Pokédex.
Do you want to show me the\nIsle of Armor Pokédex?
Do you want to show me your completed\nIsle of Armor Pokédex again?
Oh, that’s too bad.
Hee hee! Let me see.
Your current progress on the\nIsle of Armor Pokédex is...
[VAR 0202(0000)] Pokémon seen and [VAR 0202(0001)] Pokémon caught!
Hehehe. You’ve only just gotten started on\ncompleting your Isle of Armor Pokédex!\c\nGood luck! I’m cheering for you.
Hehe! You’re still new to this island, but you’re\ndoing well!\c\nIf grass is shaking, there may be a rare Pokémon!\nCheck rustling grass as much as possible!
What? You already caught 30 Pokémon or more?\nI must say you have talent.\c\nOf course, you raise your Pokémon and make\nthem evolve as well, right?\c\nBy doing so, you can fill your Pokédex!
Have you already caught 50 Pokémon?\nThat’s incredible!\c\nI-I think you might have even filled over a\nquarter of your Pokédex already...\c\nPlease walk around the Isle of Armor even more!
Whoa! What a talent!\c\nI bet you’ll catch over 100 Pokémon in\nno time!\c\nYou’ve been checking Pokémon Dens, right?\nYou can meet rare Pokémon in the dens.
Whoa! You’ve caught 100 Pokémon!\nI’ve been dreaming of this moment!\c\nI think maybe we’re halfway there?!\nThanks to you, my research is going very well.
... ... ...\n... ... ...\c\nOh, sorry! I was mesmerized by your Pokédex\n’cause it has so few blanks.\c\nI think you’re really going to complete\nthis Pokédex!\c\nI bet you already know that weather can also\ninfluence what Pokémon you encounter, too!
I’ve never seen an Isle of Armor Pokédex\nthat’s been filled so much!\c\nIs it because you make the most of\nSurprise Trades?\c\nYou can also cooperate with someone to get\nPokémon that are hard to collect.
Wow! You’re getting there.\nYou’re so close to completing your\r\nIsle of Armor Pokédex!\c\nYou no longer need my advice.\c\nI believe you can do it.\nI’ll be waiting for you!
Congratulations!\nYou finally did it!
You completed your Isle of Armor Pokédex!
Thanks to your hard work, I made remarkable\nprogress on my research.
I’m so glad that I asked you!
To commemorate your great achievement, let me\nadd something special to your League Card!
Done!
I’m extremely happy!\nPlease also take this as a token of my gratitude!
This is not something everyone can do!\nThank you so much!
Hehehe! I can’t get tired of looking at this\nawesome Isle of Armor Pokédex!\c\nCongratulations!
Oh? That Pokémon...
Is that Zarude, the Rogue Monkey Pokémon?!
It’s a Pokémon you can’t find even in the entire\nGalar region, let alone on the Isle of Armor.
Thank you for showing me Zarude.\nPlease take this as a token of my gratitude!
It’s the cap of a boy who meets a lot of Pokémon\nduring his journey. I thought it’d look nice on you.

If you give Max Soup to a Pokémon\nthat has great potential,\r\nit’ll become a special Dynamax Pokémon—\r\na Gigantamax Pokémon!\c\nBut if a Gigantamax Pokémon drinks Max Soup,\nit’ll become a Dynamax Pokémon!
If you want to know the Pokémon that have\nthe potential to Gigantamax...\c\nMy apologies, but please read the book on\nthe shelf.
If this [VAR 0101(0001)] drinks Max Soup,\nit’ll become capable of Gigantamaxing!

I’ll use three clusters of Max Mushrooms to make\nMax Soup! Is that all right?
I’ll use three clusters of Max Mushrooms and one\ncomb of Max Honey to make Max Soup!\c\nIs that all right?
Of course!
I changed my mind
What? You don’t want it?\nAll right, next time.
In order to make Max Soup, I need three\nclusters of Max Mushrooms.\c\nIf you have a Max Raid Battle, particles for\nDynamax will scatter around all over the place,\r\nwhich helps Max Mushrooms grow in forests and\r\ncaves on the Isle of Armor!
Nonobear!
Urshifu doesn’t like the taste of Max Soup and\nwon’t drink it...\c\nIt does have the potential to Gigantamax,\nthough... I wonder why it won’t drink it.
Urshifu won’t drink Max Soup unless I put\nMax Honey in it!\c\nPlease get three clusters of Max Mushrooms and\none comb of Max Honey!
I make Max Soup once per person per day!\nThat’s a promise I keep with Ms. Honey!

I’ve spent a lot of time developing many moves.

I’ll teach your Pokémon a move for a small token\nof gratitude...
Shall I teach your Pokémon a move for\nfive pieces of Armorite Ore?
Which Pokémon do you want me to teach\na move to?
You don’t have enough Armorite Ore...\nI mean, gratitude.\c
Please obtain Armorite Ore in Max Raid Battles\non the Isle of Armor.
Turning down my offer so firmly...\nThat’s a move that children are good at.
Then I’ll take your Armorite Ore...\nI mean, gratitude.

Oh! [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! Just the person I wanted\nto see! Tell me...\c\nDo you collect Watts?[VAR 0114(0074)]
Sure do!
What are those?
Of course you do!\nYou’re such a pro at all this, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0074)]
Watts are a kind of energy you can collect from\nPokémon Dens![VAR 0114(0074)]
I’ll have you know that the Watt business is\npositively booming right now around here.[VAR 0114(0074)]
They say that those who hold the most Watts\nhold the key to success![VAR 0114(0074)]
I’ve actually been trying to gather up Watts to\nspruce up the dojo a bit, get some more gear...[VAR 0114(0074)]
But both my darling hubby and my son are more\nthe indoor types, you know?[VAR 0114(0074)]
And it’s pretty hard for me to collect that many\nWatts all on my own...[VAR 0114(0074)]
If you ever happen to have some Watts to spare,\n[VAR 0100(0000)], I’d be glad to take them![VAR 0114(0074)]
Oh, but I wouldn’t ask you to give them to me\nand not get anything in return!\c\nThis would be a business transaction, of course.\nI’ll reward you for your generosity![VAR 0114(0074)]
Whenever you have some extra Watts, simply\ncome and talk to me![VAR 0114(0074)]
Hello, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nWhat can I help you with, love?[VAR 0114(0074)]
Anything else you need from me?[VAR 0114(0074)]
I’m here to share some Watts!
What’s the next goalpost?
I’m ready to battle!
Nothing
If there’s ever anything I can help you with,\njust say the word![VAR 0114(0074)]
How many Watts could you bear to part with?[VAR 0114(0074)]

Never mind
You’ll give us [VAR 0207(0001,002C)] W?[VAR 0114(0074)]
You’ll give us all your Watts, [VAR 0100(0000)]?![VAR 0114(0074)]
Oh, you sweet thing. I do appreciate your wish\nto help, but you simply don’t have the Watts![VAR 0114(0074)]
Well, [VAR 0100(0000)], you’ve given us...\n[VAR 0207(0001,002C)] W so far![VAR 0114(0074)]
Thank you so much! I’ll be sure to use the Watts\nto help develop the dojo even more.[VAR 0114(0074)]
With over [VAR 0207(0001,002C)] W, I can afford to have\na hair stylist come work here at the dojo, too![VAR 0114(0074)]
Hello, hello? Is this the hair salon?\nYes, this is Honey from the Master Dojo. ♪\c\nI was wondering if you could spare a stylist to\ncome enjoy the lovely island life with us!\r\nYes, that’s right—the Isle of Armor... Mm-hmm...[VAR 0114(0074)]
They’re sending someone right over![VAR 0114(0074)]
Hello, dojo! It’s lovely to meet you all!\nI’m your new hair stylist!
But I can’t bare all the secret arts of hair styling\nto you all. So when you’d like to have something\r\ndone, please call on me in this room here!\r\nNo cameras allowed!\r\nAnd no speaking of what you see inside this room!
Now that’s a real pro...\nTrue masters are always picky about their craft.[VAR 0114(0074)]
Hee! But now we can always look our best—\neven out here in the wilds![VAR 0114(0074)]
And since we’ve gathered over [VAR 0207(0001,002C)] W,\nI can order a Rotomi terminal for the dojo![VAR 0114(0074)]
Hello, hello? Is this the Pokémon Center?\nThis is Honey from the Master Dojo! ♪\c\nI’d like to buy one of your Rotomi terminals for\nsome Watts, but what do you say?\r\nMm-hmm... Mm-hmm... Yes, that’s right...[VAR 0114(0074)]
We were able to make a deal!\nAnd I got them to send it right over at once![VAR 0114(0074)]
Though... Hmm?\nThis doesn’t look quite right...[VAR 0114(0074)]
There’s something written on the screen here.\nNow let me see...[VAR 0114(0074)]
“Thank you for your purchase! To get your new\nRotomi up and running, you must first install our\r\nproprietary software.[VAR 0114(0074)]
“To order your copy today, contact our sales\ndepartment...at...”\r\nWhat![VAR 0114(0074)]
They’re simply trying to gouge us for more Watts!\nOf all the greedy, conniving business practices![VAR 0114(0074)]
I’m awfully sorry about this, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nBut it looks like we’ll need a bit more of your\nhelp to get our Rotomi up and running...[VAR 0114(0074)]
And now that we’ve exceeded [VAR 0207(0001,002C)] W,\nwe can finally get our Rotomi up and running![VAR 0114(0074)]
Hello, hello? Is this the Pokémon Center?\nHoney from the Master Dojo! ♪\r\nYes, again! Fancy that...\c\nWe ordered a Rotomi from you a little while\nback... Yes, yes, it does look lovely...\r\nBut we’d rather prefer it to actually WORK, too.\r\nMm-hmm... Could you send someone right over?[VAR 0114(0074)]
Now that that’s taken care of...\nLet’s fire it up![VAR 0114(0074)]
Roto!
Pleazzzed to greet you, Mzzz. Honey!
Rotomi at your service! Bzzzt!
And I am delighted to hear it!\nI’m sure you’ll be worth every last Watt you’ve\r\ncost us... In fact, we’ll make sure of it![VAR 0114(0074)]

So be sure to use it plenty![VAR 0114(0074)]
And now that we’ve blown past [VAR 0207(0001,002C)] W,\nwe can get a vending machine for the dojo, too![VAR 0114(0074)]
Hello, hello? Is this Macro Cosmos Living?\nYes, this is Honey over at the Master Dojo. ♪\c\nI was just wondering if we could get one of your\nlovely vending machines over here at our dojo...\r\nYes, yes, that’s right... Of course...[VAR 0114(0074)]
*glug glug glug*\nAhhhhh! That is some refreshing water![VAR 0114(0074)]
We’re able to offer the drinks at far less than the\nusual asking price, so I’d get all your drinks from\r\nhere from now on if I were you![VAR 0114(0074)]
We’ve only got Fresh Water in stock so far,\nbut the dojo’s services are really getting robust![VAR 0114(0074)]
With some more Watts, I can expand the lineup\neven further, too.[VAR 0114(0074)]
And we’ve hit [VAR 0207(0001,002C)] W!\nWe can stock Soda Pop in the vending machine![VAR 0114(0074)]

A refreshing bottle of Lemonade sounds like\njust the thing to cool you down when you’re\r\nfeeling all hot and sweaty![VAR 0114(0074)]
I think we’ve got quite the lineup of drinks now,\nbut maybe we could use something to nosh on?[VAR 0114(0074)]
And since we reached [VAR 0207(0001,002C)] W, I think\nI can arrange for regular deliveries of fresh\r\ningredients to come here to the dojo![VAR 0114(0074)]

Looks like I’ve scared off another potential\nstudent for the dojo.[VAR 0114(0074)]
I’d been looking forward to surprising you, too,\n[VAR 0100(0000)], but that silly sausage went and\r\nruined everything![VAR 0114(0074)]
But, well, there’s no use crying over spilt\nMoomoo Milk![VAR 0114(0074)]
So now you know! The strong Trainer you’ll be\nfacing is me! Honey! ♪[VAR 0114(0074)]
You think you’re ready for me, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0074)]
I’m about to blow your mind![VAR 0114(0074)]
Nooooooooo! Fiddlesticks!\nI didn’t think you’d actually be able to beat me![VAR 0114(0074)]
But at least you did get my pulse racing...[VAR 0114(0074)]
Thanks for showing me a really great time in\nthat battle![VAR 0114(0074)]
Honestly, my darling hubby would be the first to\ntell you that he and I are on the same level\r\nwhen it comes to our strength in battle...[VAR 0114(0074)]
And yet you beat me, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nYou really are strong![VAR 0114(0074)]
I’m sure that you’re really igniting a new fire in\nmy darling hubby and our other students.[VAR 0114(0074)]
I don’t mean to ask too much of you, but if I\nmight ask a bit more...[VAR 0114(0074)]
Please do carry on as a part of the Master Dojo\nfamily, and help all our family learn and grow![VAR 0114(0074)]
Oh, and...[VAR 0114(0074)]
I won’t let you rest on your laurels\nfor too long, mind![VAR 0114(0074)]
Let’s have another great battle soon![VAR 0114(0074)]
Heehee!\nBattling you really is the best, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0074)]
Give me another shot at beating you tomorrow,\nwon’t you?[VAR 0114(0074)]
Oooooh, that one felt really close!\nYou nearly had me, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0074)]
But victory is mine today![VAR 0114(0074)]
But I’m pretty tuckered out for today.[VAR 0114(0074)]
Let’s save the revenge match for tomorrow!\nI’ll be waiting for it![VAR 0114(0074)]
I’m pretty tuckered out for today.\nCome ask me for another battle tomorrow, ’K?[VAR 0114(0074)]
You know, [VAR 0100(0000)], we have so much to\nthank you for...[VAR 0114(0074)]
It’s all because of the Watts you shared with us\nthat we were able to make the Master Dojo into\r\nthe fine facility it is today.[VAR 0114(0074)]
I tried my best to help
No, no... It was nothing!
And you succeeded! It’s amazing how you\nmanaged to collect so many Watts![VAR 0114(0074)]
Oh, you humble H[VAR 1100(00FF,0405)]ubertolly!\nI won’t have you downplaying this effort![VAR 0114(0074)]
You know, when my hubby first told me that he\nwanted to open a dojo of his own...[VAR 0114(0074)]
I have to admit, I had a lot of doubts.[VAR 0114(0074)]
I was still working at my previous job at the time.[VAR 0114(0074)]
And there was simply so much work that went\ninto getting the dojo built...[VAR 0114(0074)]
Let alone the question of whether anyone would\neven want to move to an uninhabited island like\r\nthis, just to train at an unknown dojo![VAR 0114(0074)]
But...my hubby-wubby and I both gave it our all.[VAR 0114(0074)]
And when Hyde came along, the students all\npitched in and helped out with everything.[VAR 0114(0074)]
And of course, you’ve been a huge help\nas well, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0074)]
We’ve made it to where we are today because\nwe got so much help from so many people...[VAR 0114(0074)]
This has been an entirely different chapter of my\nlife, but it’s turned out to be a great one![VAR 0114(0074)]
So thank you, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0074)]
I’d like you to take this.\nNot as any sort of payback for all you’ve done,\r\nbut just because I want you to have it.[VAR 0114(0074)]
It’s a very rare card that only the master and I\nhave had copies of until now![VAR 0114(0074)]
Oh, look! Slowpoke![VAR 0114(0074)]
Slooow...
Po?
Teehee!\nDon’t they look all lovey-dovey to you?[VAR 0114(0074)]
Ahhh! This has been so lovely!\nIt’s been so long since I was last able to simply\r\ntake a nice stroll without worrying about a thing![VAR 0114(0074)]
Just feeling the lovely breeze on my face...[VAR 0114(0074)]
But if we stay away too long, I suppose everyone\nwill start to worry about us.[VAR 0114(0074)]
It’s time we headed back home![VAR 0114(0074)]
Let’s go home!
Can’t we stay just a little longer?
Heehee! Of course!\nOur family is waiting![VAR 0114(0074)]
Now, now... Look who is trying to hog Ms. Honey’s\nattentions all to h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imerself![VAR 0114(0074)]
Thank you for the lovely stroll, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0074)]
Though, I’m a little embarrassed about how much\nI blathered on about my own past![VAR 0114(0074)]
Don’t tell anyone I’m such a soggy Sally!\nI’m counting on you![VAR 0114(0074)]
If you could spare us another [VAR 0207(0001,002C)] W,\n[VAR 0100(0000)], then...let’s see...[VAR 0114(0074)]
I could hire a hair stylist for the dojo so you\ncould change your look whenever you like!\r\nHow would that sound?[VAR 0114(0074)]
I could try to get the dojo one of those Rotomi\nterminals, like they’ve got at Pokémon Centers![VAR 0114(0074)]
I could get our Rotomi actually up and running![VAR 0114(0074)]
I’ll put in a vending machine where you can buy\nreally cheap drinks whenever you like![VAR 0114(0074)]
I’ll increase the vending machine’s lineup\nby adding Soda Pop, too![VAR 0114(0074)]
I’ll increase the vending machine’s lineup\nby adding Lemonade, too![VAR 0114(0074)]
I’ll have fresh ingredients for cooking delivered\nregularly to the dojo![VAR 0114(0074)]
I’ll make it so you can buy nutritious supplements\nfrom a vending machine right here at the dojo![VAR 0114(0074)]
I’ll make more kinds of supplements available\nin our vending machine![VAR 0114(0074)]
I’ll make even more kinds of supplements\navailable in our vending machine![VAR 0114(0074)]
I’ll have a special Master Dojo design made for\nyour League Card![VAR 0114(0074)]
[~ 239]
I’ll be able to make you a true work of beauty!\nYou’ll have to wait to find out just what! Teehee![VAR 0114(0074)]
[~ 241]
I’ll set you up with the chance to battle a\nfrightfully strong Trainer! Really![VAR 0114(0074)]
Well, there’s not much more that I can offer\nyou...except maybe a bit of my time?\c\nWe don’t get much time to really talk here at\nthe dojo with so many students around.\c\nWould you like to go on a nice quiet walk,\njust you and me?[VAR 0114(0074)]

I can’t repay you in any way, but how many\nWatts do you want to share with us?[VAR 0114(0074)]
Thank you, love! I’m sure the dojo will put it to\ngood use in some way or another![VAR 0114(0074)]
Hrmm... If only someone—\n*mumble*\c\nNo, but who would gather that many—\n*mumble*[VAR 0114(0074)]
What’s this?\nThere’s a note stuck to the refrigerator...\c\n“These ingredients are for everyone’s meals!\nNo nicking food outside of mealtime! —Honey”
The refrigerator is packed full of ingredients.\nWhat are you in the mood for?

So? Does my Exp. Charm seem to be working\nas intended?[VAR 0114(0075)]
What is this thing? Some sort of machine made\nout of junk parts to look like...a Pokémon?
You like it?[VAR 0114(0075)]
Hmph. You wouldn’t get it anyway.[VAR 0114(0075)]
Heh. I thought you might be the type.[VAR 0114(0075)]
That’s my [VAR FF00(0006)]Cram-o-matic[VAR FF00(0000)], and—just to be clear—\nit’s the invention of the century.[VAR 0114(0075)]
It’s my very own brilliant take on recycling.[VAR 0114(0075)]
Though it doesn’t do a thing right now, since it’s\nout of power...[VAR 0114(0075)]
If I just had enough [VAR FF00(0006)]Watts[VAR FF00(0000)]...\c\nBut Mummy won’t give me any more of hers...[VAR 0114(0075)]
All it would take is a measly 500 W to get the\nCram-o-matic up and running, y’know?[VAR 0114(0075)]
I can give you that
That’s too bad
Whoa! Seriously?!\nYou’ll give me the 500 W I need?![VAR 0114(0075)]
Do you want to keep going with the same\ncombination of items?
You obtained [VAR 1302(0001,0000)][VAR 010A(0001)]!
You’re lacking one or more items.\nEnding combination process...
It’d take me ages outdoors to collect 500 W...\nAnd the outdoors and me...\c\nWell...let’s just say, our systems\naren’t compatible.[VAR 0114(0075)]
But you... Sorry, what was your name again?\n[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]?\r\nI guess you’re more the outdoors type, huh?[VAR 0114(0075)]
I’ll feed those Watts you gave me into the\nCram-o-matic at once, and...[VAR 0114(0075)]
Power! On![VAR 0114(0075)]
Crrr...
Crrraaa-AAAMMMMMM!
Huhuhu... Perfect. Just perfect.[VAR 0114(0075)]
Put in four items you don’t need, and you’ll get\none new item in exchange.[VAR 0114(0075)]
If you put in four of the Apricorns that grow\nhere on the Isle of Armor, then you might\r\neven get a rare Poké Ball...if you’re real lucky.[VAR 0114(0075)]
Since you gave me the Watts and all, feel free\nto use my Cram-o-matic as much as you like.[VAR 0114(0075)]
So if you want [VAR 1302(0001,0000)][VAR 010A(0001)]...[VAR 0114(0075)]
First you’ll want to add\n[VAR 1302(0002,0000)][VAR 010A(0002)]...[VAR 0114(0075)]
Then you’ll need\n[VAR 1302(0003,0000)][VAR 010A(0003)]...[VAR 0114(0075)]
[VAR 1302(0004,0000)][VAR 010A(0004)]...and\n... ... ...[VAR 0114(0075)]
[VAR 1302(0005,0000)][VAR 010A(0005)].[VAR 0114(0075)]
[~ 66]
[~ 67]
[~ 68]
Fine, I’ll explain how the Cram-o-matic works\none more time...[VAR 0114(0075)]
You take four items you don’t need, you put ’em\nin, and then you get one new item. That’s it.[VAR 0114(0075)]
[~ 71]
Huhuhu... Perfect.\nNow it’s sure to work.[VAR 0114(0075)]
All that’s left is to fire it up with the ON button,\nso...here we go! Let’s push it![VAR 0114(0075)]
Crrrrrr...
... ... ...
Cripes! It powered down.[VAR 0114(0075)]
Must still need more Watts...[VAR 0114(0075)]
What’s that, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nDid you actually manage to get a rare ball?![VAR 0114(0075)]
You’ve got some serious luck.\nI’ve run the numbers, and those things are rare.[VAR 0114(0075)]
One of Daddy’s friends came here once to make\nthose kinds of balls for him. This real old guy...[VAR 0114(0075)]
He may have been old, but he was good.\nHe could make a rare ball with just\r\none Apricorn.[VAR 0114(0075)]
I tried to observe how he did it and program that\ninto my Cram-o-matic.[VAR 0114(0075)]
But my success rate is still way lower than that\nold guy could pull off...[VAR 0114(0075)]
But I’ll keep improving my tech, until someday,\nwe can replicate the skills of even a\r\nmaster craftsman through the power of science.\r\nJust you wait.[VAR 0114(0075)]
Er. I mean. Forget it... I said too much...[VAR 0114(0075)]
Want me to share one of my recipes with you?\nI can. It’ll cost you [VAR 0203(0001,002C)] W. That’s all.[VAR 0114(0075)]
Come back when you’ve collected some Watts.[VAR 0114(0075)]
You don’t have enough Watts.[VAR 0114(0075)]

Oi, oi! We don’t get too many Trainers out in\nthese parts!
They call me Digging Pa. You’ve met the\nDigging Duo? Well, they’d be my sons!
Digging Pa’s the name, and digging’s my game.\nWell...more my vocation, really.
Haven’t got any Armorite Ore, have you?\nYou know, it’s that rare type of rock\r\nthe Isle of Armor’s known for?
If you just give us a few pieces of that ore,\nI’ll put these fine old muscles straight to work,\r\ndigging you up loads of Watts!
[~ 5]
Shall I dig you up some Watts in exchange for\n[VAR 0201(0003)] piece[VAR 1101(0003,0100)]s of Armorite Ore? You’ll need to jot\r\ndown a quick record of your progress first,\r\nif that’s all right.
Well, give us a shout if you need Watts!
Digging Pa...at your service! What can I do for\nyou today?
Dig me up some Watts
Tell me what my record is
Nothing, thanks
[~ 12]
[~ 13]
Right then. Here goes!
I’ve dug up [VAR 0207(0000,002C)] W just now. Shall I keep\non digging?
Phew! That’s all the digging I’ve got in me!
H-hold on! I can...I can still keep digging!
Graaah!
Heh! Feels like I could dig up a Watt trove like\nI haven’t seen in ages!
Here goes!
There’s [VAR 0207(0000,002C)] W!
One last go, then!
Digging [VAR 0107(0001)]!
Phew. Right. Feels like I’ve settled down a bit.
I dug up [VAR 0208(0001,002C)] W altogether this time.
Your record is [VAR 0208(0001,002C)] W in one session.
Oho! Got yourself some Armorite Ore, have you?\nMind giving us [VAR 0201(0003)] piece[VAR 1101(0003,0100)]s?
If you get your hands on some Armorite Ore,\ncome give us a piece!
I’ve dug up [VAR 0208(0001,002C)] W!
Hold your Horsea! Bit short on Armorite Ore,\naren’t you?\r\nCome again when you’ve got a good [VAR 0201(0003)] piece[VAR 1101(0003,0100)]s!
Y’know what? Our meeting feels like a real\nstroke of luck!\c\nIf you like, I’ll dig you up some Watts for free to\nmark the occasion! You’ll just need to jot down\r\nyour progress first. That all right?

Hello.\nPeople call me Digging Ma.\c\nHave you met Digging Pa?\nHe’s my partner.
I enjoy digging and the thrill of digging with my\nlovely shovel. It’s my digging friend.
I feel like giving you a piece of Armorite Ore to\ncommemorate our meeting...
But, no! I’ll give you a chance to choose!\c\nYou could receive the piece of Armorite Ore...\nor you could use it as payment to have me dig\r\nto see if I can find even more Armorite Ore!
However! If my lovely shovel breaks while I’m\ndigging, you won’t get anything...
I do need to ask you to quickly save your\nprogress first, but if you are seeking some thrills,\r\nwhy not try your luck with me?
[~ 6]
[~ 7]
Digging always comes with risks...\nIt’s unavoidable. Brace yourself...
[~ 9]
I’m looking forward to when you’re ready for a\ngame of your lifetime!
Here I go!
Aah... Sorry!\nI hit a hard rock, and my lovely shovel broke.
The Armorite Ore you were supposed to get\nis gone...
Such is life!\nAnyway, see you again somewhere!
I dug up [VAR 0203(0001,002C)] piece[VAR 1101(0001,0100)]s of Armorite Ore.

Di... Digleeet!
Oh! Diglett!\nYou’re here!
Hahaha! You little rascal!\nI was worried about you!
Dig!
Thank you for finding my Diglett.
Is that a Diglett?
Is it from Alola?
This is a Diglett from the Alola region!
It’s a regional form. That means it has a different\nappearance, because it’s from a different region!
Oh! I didn’t expect to meet someone who knows\nabout it!
That’s right! This is a Diglett from the\nAlola region.
When I traveled in Alola, I fell in love with these\nadorable three hairs.
I caught a lot of Diglett there and came back.\c\nBut they went somewhere when I looked away\nfor a second...
Digleee!
Anyway, you found a Diglett buried in\nthe ground...
You definitely have a talent for finding Diglett!
If it’s OK, will you find all the other Diglett, too?
Oh, what a kind person you are! Words can’t\nexpress how grateful I am!
Don’t worry. It’s not that hard.\c\nDuring your adventure, all you have to do is find\ntufts of three hairs and speak to them.
You’ve found [VAR 0202(0001)] Diglett so far, so please find\n[VAR 0202(0002)] more Diglett.
If you find them, please tell them to come back\nto me.
If you find the last one, please tell it to come\nback to me.
Oh! Hello!
Thanks to you, [VAR 0202(0001)] more Diglett came back\nto me!
One of them has evolved into Dugtrio...
If you find those three hairs again, please tell\nthem to come back to me!
I’m so happy that a lot of Diglett came back.\nSo...
I’d like to give this Pokémon to you!
I met this Pokémon in Alola—just like my Diglett!
I’d like to give this item to you!
Ah... Including the one that just came back,\nthe number of Diglett that have come back is...
Wha—? All 151 Diglett came back?!
Thank you so much!\nThanks to you, all my Diglett have come back!
Dispec!
I think this Diglett is saying that you’re worthy of\nits respect, because you found them all.
Dugether!
What? You want to go together with this Trainer,\nbecause you respect h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer?
Diii!
Hmmm.\nI feel a bit sad, but...
if that’s what it wants, I’ll respect its wish!
Please take good care of Diglett.
Diglett became your Pokémon!
How is your Diglett?\c\nMy Diglett and I are having a blast ’cause I\nstill have 150 of them.

You seem to have an awesome bike!\c\nLet me customize it if you’d like!
Oh... Hmmm.\c\nLet me know when you get a bike that can run on\nthe water.
I’m a bike lady!\nI love bikes and bike maintenance!
Do you want me to customize your bike with a\ndesign that I came up with?
Sparkling White

Original design

Which design would you like to choose?
Sparkling White it is!\c\nI’ll polish your bike so that it’ll shine with\nsparkling white light!

You want to change it back to the original\ndesign? Sure thing!
Hahaha! I get it. You like your bike the way it is!
Come back anytime when you want me to\ncustomize your bike.
OK! Hold on a second!
Customization complete!\nEnjoy your ride!
Your Rotom Bike is now Sparkling White!
Your Rotom Bike is now Glistening Black!
Your Rotom Bike was changed back to the\noriginal design.
Come back anytime when you want to try a\ndifferent customization!
Changing the appearance can change your\nmood, too!\c\nDo you want me to customize your bike?
While I was at it, I also set your bike’s charge\nspeed to the max.
You want to change the color of your outfit.\nIs that right?\c\nThen I’ll make it so that the color matches\nyour [VAR 0101(0006)] there.
Rotom colors
[VAR 0103(0004)]-type color
[VAR 0103(0005)]-type color
Never mind
How about the [VAR 0103(0004)]-type color?\nIt would match your [VAR 0101(0006)] very well!
Which color do you think would match your\n[VAR 0101(0006)] best?
Would you like to use one of these colors to\nmatch your [VAR 0101(0006)]?
Would you like to use one of these colors to\nmatch your [VAR 0101(0006)]?
Is the [VAR 0103(0004)]-type color what\nyou want?
Actually, never mind
Yes! Very good!\nYou’ve picked a wonderful color!
Hmmm. That’s the same color it is now!\nIt’s not a color change at all!

Hi-yah! [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]!\nDo you want to try Restricted Sparring?
Yes
Tell me how it works
No thanks
No, I’ll quit
Select the type you want to use for sparring.
I won’t force you to do anything you don’t want\nto do. Some other time, then.
Restricted Sparring is a training course that\nrestricts the type of Pokémon you can use.\c\nSelect a type first, and then battle using up to\nthree Pokémon of that type.\c\nNo duplicate Pokémon or items are allowed.\c\nIf you can win five times in a row, you’ll\ncomplete the training.\c\nHowever, if you lose even once, the sparring\nwill end there!\c\nYou can restore your Pokémon between battles,\nbut only twice in total, so use the opportunities\r\nvery wisely.\c\nThat’s all!\nDo you want to try Restricted Sparring?
Oh, you changed your mind?\nSome other time, then.
Let the battles begin!\nBattle No. 1!\r\nReady...
Next. Battle No. [VAR 0203(0001,0000)]!\nReady...
[~ 15]
Go!
Well done!
Do you want to restore your Pokémon?\n(You can restore them [VAR 0200(0001)] more time[VAR 1101(0001,0100)]s.)
You lost...but train yourself and your Pokémon,\nand try again!\r\nI’m looking forward to your next challenge.
Your result for this Restricted Sparring set is...\c\nYou had [VAR 0203(0001,002C)] victor[VAR 1101(0001,0301)]yies with the\n[VAR 0103(0002)]-type Pokémon restriction!
The way you handle [VAR 0103(0002)]-type Pokémon\nis flawless!
To recognize your untiring efforts, I’ll give this\nto you.
I hope you’ll try to complete the training with\nother types, too!
What?! You completed Restricted Sparring with\nall types?!
I can’t believe it...\nYour achievement is just phenomenal!
This accomplishment is sure to go down in\ndojo history!\c\nTo commemorate this monumental achievement,\nI’ll grant you the right to wear this outfit!
I hope you’ll keep exceeding your own limits!
Do you want to continue sparring?
Yes, I’ll have my Pokémon restored and continue
Yes, I’ll continue
Do you want to continue sparring?\n(You can restore your Pokémon [VAR 0200(0001)] more time[VAR 1101(0001,0100)]s.)

Oh, hello, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Have a look at this!
Klara’s performance in that last trial resonated\nwith me...
Avery’s performance in that last trial resonated\nwith me...
so much so that it inspired me to design this\noriginal Klara shirt!
so much so that it inspired me to design this\noriginal Avery shirt!
But when I offered it to her, she gave me a look\nlike I was trying to hand her some rubbish.
But when I offered it to him, he gave me a look\nlike I was trying to hand him some rubbish.
So being rivals, I suppose you’d be the next best\nperson to give it to, [VAR 0100(0000)]...
But what in the world was wrong with it?\nI thought it was so well-made!

Okie dokie. Leave it to me.

I am a world-renowned designer of fashion!
You are Galarian, I presume? This is my first time\nsetting foot in this region, and I must say...it\r\nseems rather deserted!
Erm, this is...
You’re on the Isle of Armor!
I beg your pardon? I’ve disembarked at the\nwrong station?!
How fortunate you were here to steer me true!\nMy most heartfelt gratitude to you!
I say, I’ve heard Galar’s Champion, Leon, is quite\nthe beloved figure in the region.
I smelled the opportunity to take advantage of\nLeon’s wild popularity to seek further riches...\r\nHence, my voyage!
But now I find myself without the funds to even\nreach my destination!
If you’ve a mind to purchase this delectably,\nsurpassingly cute ensemble I’ve designed for\r\n[VAR 0204(0001,002C)], it would cover my taxi fare onward.
I’ll take it!

Hello there, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nAre you drinking in the Isle of Armor’s natural\nbeauty, too?[VAR 0114(000E)]
I like to get out here now and again.\nIt’s a nice spot for taking it easy,\r\ndon’t you think?[VAR 0114(000E)]
Isn’t all this unspoiled nature on the island lovely?\nLook how cheery it’s got little Tsareena![VAR 0114(000E)]
All this lush foliage makes for such a pleasant\nforest stroll. I should’ve packed a picnic![VAR 0114(000E)]
Wooloo’s got such a fluffy, thick fleece, it could\ntake a tumble from heights like these\r\nand still be right as rain![VAR 0114(000E)]
OI! Oi...oi...o...i...\c\nDon’t caves like this make you want to shout\njust to hear the echo?[VAR 0114(000E)]
Look at this great blue sea!\c\nIf Nessa were here, I bet she’d be over\nthe moon!\r\nNot that she’d let it show...[VAR 0114(000E)]
This is far from the friendliest environment for\nGrass-type Pokémon, but some plants actually\r\nthrive in deserts like this![VAR 0114(000E)]
Harsh sunlight actually livens up some\nGrass-type Pokémon!\c\nBut on the other hand, it means they’re in for an\neven worse time than usual if they go up against\r\nFire types...[VAR 0114(000E)]
The weather here on the isle is so fickle!\nIt sort of reminds me of battling Raihan, actually.\r\nMakes me a tad nervous...[VAR 0114(000E)]
Ahhh, nothing like a spot of rain! Time for all\nthe isle’s lovely greenery to have a drink.[VAR 0114(000E)]
My hat’s meant for farm work, but it comes in\nquite handy during weather like this.\r\nIt’s a lifesaver in battle![VAR 0114(000E)]
Oh, it’s you, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nIf you keep running about in this thick fog, you’ll\r\nslam right into me and go flying![VAR 0114(000E)]
Shalalan.
Well, hello there, Champion!\nHave you come to see me?[VAR 0114(000F)]
No, no, just winding you up a bit.\nI’ve got some time off from my modeling and\r\nGym Leader work, so I’m honing my moves.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Look at this—nature as far as the eye can see.\nJust the sort of spot Milo’d love, right?[VAR 0114(000F)]
When it rains here in the forest, the sound’s\nso calming.\c\nIt makes for a nice mental refresh if I’ve lost a\nbattle or something.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Doesn’t the breeze up here feel nice?\nIt’s the type of day that makes you think a\r\nWingull might swoop by and bring you a letter![VAR 0114(000F)]
You can get to the sea through here.\nThere are some small islands around there—\r\nmy favorite spots![VAR 0114(000F)]
The water looks so inviting...\nWonder how many seconds it’d take me to swim\r\nto that island out there?[VAR 0114(000F)]
Drednaw and I are doing some intensive training.\nWe’re working on moves that can drench even\r\nthis bone-dry desert![VAR 0114(000F)]
Look at this brilliant swimming weather!\nGood thing the Hulbury Gym uniform doubles\r\nas a swimsuit, so I can dive right in![VAR 0114(000F)]
Clouds have got to cover a certain proportion of\nthe sky for a day to officially be called cloudy.\c\nThe sky’s at least nine-tenths covered today, so\nthat definitely qualifies![VAR 0114(000F)]
Rain’s got its share of haters, but I guarantee you\nnone of them are Water-type Pokémon!\c\nIt just goes to show how people and Pokémon\ndon’t always agree on what’s nice weather![VAR 0114(000F)]
Since Drednaw’s also a Rock type, it grows more\nresistant to special moves during sandstorms.[VAR 0114(000F)]
In thick fogs like this, it’s easy for ships to lose\ntheir way at sea. That’s why we have lighthouses,\r\nlike the one in Hulbury![VAR 0114(000F)]
Munch munch munch.
Champion [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nYour passion for training must burn red-hot if\r\nit’s led you all the way to the Isle of Armor![VAR 0114(0010)]
I’ve got to keep on running so I don’t get left in\nyour dust![VAR 0114(0010)]
Centiskorch’s burning body’s been known to start\nfires in grassy fields!\c\nWhen that happens, I douse it with water from a\nbottle I bring along![VAR 0114(0010)]
In forests, one tends to meet a lot of Grass\nand Bug types!\c\nHaving a Fire type like Centiskorch along is a\nbig help![VAR 0114(0010)]
What better for long training runs than a nice,\nlong staircase?\c\nI’ve gone and gotten a tad carried away and\ndone 100 laps, so I’m enjoying a nice break![VAR 0114(0010)]
This place is teeming with Water types—just like\nGalar Mine No. 2! What a great spot for training![VAR 0114(0010)]
Training in the water is very tough for my team!\nSo I just do enough swimming for Centiskorch\r\nand me both![VAR 0114(0010)]
I met my Torkoal in the Potbottom Desert!\c\nSince its Ability changes the weather, I suggested\nto Raihan that he think about catching one.\r\nTurns out he took me up on it, so now\r\nwe’re Tor-colleagues![VAR 0114(0010)]
This type of calm weather is ideal for training!\nHup, two, three, four![VAR 0114(0010)]
Clouds may hide the sun, but they don’t keep\nall its ultraviolet rays from getting through!\c\nThat’s why I like to wear a hat or some sun cream\nand stay well hydrated![VAR 0114(0010)]
Rain puts a damper on the power of my\nblazing moves.\c\nBest to send those rain clouds packing with\nSunny Day or Max Flare![VAR 0114(0010)]
If you can’t overcome a sandstorm, you’re in for\na tough time against Raihan!\c\nThis is fine weather for concocting a strategy to\ncounter him![VAR 0114(0010)]
You can meet different Pokémon depending on\nthe weather!\r\nI wonder what species I’d run into in this fog?[VAR 0114(0010)]
Skorrrch.
Oh, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nHere for some secret training?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Becoming Champion hasn’t stopped you putting\nin the effort, I see.\c\nI’ll have to stay just as motivated with Machamp\nand the rest of my team.[VAR 0114(0011)]
There’s a man who was a legendary Fighting-type\nGym Leader in his day living on this island.\c\nBut I’m too intimidated to actually try to go\nand meet the legend in the flesh...[VAR 0114(0011)]
You never quite know when an Emolga might\nswoop down...\c\nIt’s difficult to plan your counter for such an\nunpredictable Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0011)]
This area reminds me of Stow-on-Side...\c\nThinking all of the members of the Fighting Gym\nback home spurs me to train all the harder![VAR 0114(0011)]
Going barefoot makes it more effective when\nyou need to dig in your heels and stand firm.\c\nI suspect that’s why Machamp always goes\nbarefoot as well![VAR 0114(0011)]
I find swimming can be very effective when I\nwant to build strength.\c\nThat means Nessa must be getting quite a lot of\ntraining in every day![VAR 0114(0011)]
Doesn’t the layout of this area remind you of a\npitch surrounded by spectators’ seats?\c\nIt’s helpful for visualizing a real battle scenario.[VAR 0114(0011)]
It feels to me like training in harsher weather is\nmore effective than on mild days like this.\c\nOn the other hand, at least my bare feet get less\nmuddy when it’s nice and clear.[VAR 0114(0011)]
When my thoughts get as murky and gloomy as\nthe sky is right now, sparring with Machamp\r\nclears the clouds straight from my mind.[VAR 0114(0011)]
No matter how hard the rain pummels you,\nyou’ve got to keep swinging those fists!\c\nYou must believe that every punch drives you\none step closer to victory![VAR 0114(0011)]
This sandstorm is nothing to me.\nIt’s about as scary as the attack Splash!\c\nNot that I’m trying to pick a fight with Nessa...[VAR 0114(0011)]
Even if you can’t see your opponent, you can still\nsense their presence with your mind’s eye.\c\nBeing stuck in a bank of thick fog is perfect\ntraining for this skill.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Ha! Yah!
...O-oh, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nWhat are you...doing here?[VAR 0114(0012)]
...Oh, training?\c\nMm... Yeah, you can focus here.\n...Since there are no people.[VAR 0114(0012)]
...I-I sometimes see a massive Pokémon across\nthe water.\r\n...Maybe it’s D-Dynamaxing?[VAR 0114(0012)]
...This place feels nothing like Glimwood Tangle.\nTh-though it’s about as easy to get lost in...[VAR 0114(0012)]
...Th-this area’s so steep and rugged, it reminds me\nof Stow-on-Side.\c\n...T-take care not to fall.\nWe don’t know each other that well yet...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Eep! ...Er, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nB-behind you...\c\nAh, er, nothing... It’s nothing\ntoo bad...relatively speaking.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I...I can hear so many voices from the sea...\nDo you think they’re all lonely?[VAR 0114(0012)]
...I’m b-building a little mountain of sand.\c\nApparently if one absorbs enough grudges, it can\nbecome a Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0012)]
...Quite a h-hot one today, isn’t it?\nIt’s getting all sweaty underneath my mask.\r\nThat really...dampens my spirits...[VAR 0114(0012)]
...It’s so dark, with the sky wrapped up in all these\nthick black clouds.\r\nHonestly, it’s a bit of a relief...[VAR 0114(0012)]
...Er...would you...ahh?\c\nWould you...like to hear a scary story that’s got\nto do with rain?[VAR 0114(0012)]
...Wh-when I’m wearing my mask, even sandstorms\naren’t much of a bother.\c\nMaybe I should have Gengar and the rest wear\nmasks, too...[VAR 0114(0012)]
I-I’ve made a big discovery!\c\nWhen I can’t see my opponent through the fog,\nI hardly get nervous at all![VAR 0114(0012)]
Geh heh heh.
What are you doing here? Did that old gran\nmake you come stand guard here, too?\c\nMarch you all the way to the Isle of Armor so you\ncould reach new heights of pink...or whatever?[VAR 0114(000C)]
No, never mind, that’s nothing to do with you.\nMust be just a coincidence.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I know there’s a dojo near here, but I’ll pass.\nI can’t imagine anything more stressful than\r\nliving and training in that sort of big group.[VAR 0114(000C)]
My Hatterene was given to me by the chairman.\nWe’ve been through thick and thin together—\r\nshe’s a very important Pokémon to me.[VAR 0114(000C)]
This area looks just like that town with the mural.\nGosh, what was I playing at when I went and\r\ndestroyed that thing...[VAR 0114(000C)]
You and I seem to run into each other in caves\na lot, don’t we?\r\nIt must be fate. Not the good kind, mind.[VAR 0114(000C)]
What a carefree, tedious island this is!\nIt makes me wonder if there’s anything at all to\r\nbe gained from coming here.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Hatterene seems right at home in places where\nthere aren’t many living things about.\c\nThey spare her the stress of sensing loads of\nemotions all around her.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m itching to show you the new stronger me\nI’ve become from training out here on\r\nthis island![VAR 0114(000C)]
Ugh, this humidity’s got my hair all frizzy.\c\nEven a Gym Leader like me is trying\nto look his best—\c\nI hope that, as Champion, you take extra\ncare to be presentable![VAR 0114(000C)]
Out for a nice carefree stroll in this bad weather?\nYou’re certainly an odd one...aren’t you?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Ugh! I’ve got sand in my hair!\nIf I don’t wash it out carefully, it’ll be stuck in\r\nthere for days![VAR 0114(000C)]
This fog always eludes you, no matter how long\nyou chase after it...\r\nIt reminds me of you... How disagreeable.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Hmmm?
Fancy meeting you here, Champion![VAR 0114(0014)]
We’re trying out some tricky movements geared\nto bring out Coalossal’s full power.\r\nSo don’t get too comfortable being Champion![VAR 0114(0014)]
An acquaintance of mine gave me an Armor Pass.\nI figured it’d be nice to have a change of scenery\r\nonce in a while for our training.[VAR 0114(0014)]
The air’s so damp in here! Makes it quite hot and\nhumid, doesn’t it?\c\nIf my mum were here, she’d never stop\ncomplaining about it. That’s for sure...[VAR 0114(0014)]
Quite the view up here, isn’t it? Look how far\nyou can see!\c\nToo bad you can’t make out Circhester, but that’s\nto be expected, I guess.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Coalossal seems to perk up a bit when we head\ninto a cave.\c\nI suppose it must feel like being back home in\nGalar Mine.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Coalossal may be weak to Water, but its Ability\nmakes it grow much speedier when it gets wet![VAR 0114(0014)]
Watch out—there’s a chance Coalossal might\ntip over!\r\nIt’s about three times my weight, so be careful![VAR 0114(0014)]
Daytime here on the Isle of Armor’s hot enough\nto get me all sweaty.\c\nNot like Circhester, where I’m grateful for every\nbit of heat Coalossal gives off.[VAR 0114(0014)]
What a thick blanket of clouds!\nSeems like we’re in for some showers.\r\nAnd no, it’s not smoke from Coalossal.[VAR 0114(0014)]
I slipped in the mud and nearly fell...\nBut I managed to turn that into a backward\r\nsomersault and land safely![VAR 0114(0014)]
Being able to walk around in sandstorms like this\nunbothered is one of the greatest things about\r\nwearing sunglasses![VAR 0114(0014)]
No matter how many times I wipe my lenses, they\njust fog back up and I can’t see a thing...\r\nTraining’s on hold until this fog clears![VAR 0114(0014)]
Chugga chug.
Goodness, fancy meeting you here!\nCurious about my top-secret training regime,\r\nare you?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Well, that’s a shame, because I can’t let you see!\nYou’ll have to wait just a tad longer.[VAR 0114(0015)]
I got an Armor Pass from someone I know,\nso I thought...why not take the chance to raise\r\nmy Pokémon in some fresh scenery?[VAR 0114(0015)]
It’s so damp in here and the heat’s unbearable!\nPerhaps my Circhester outfit was a touch too\r\nheavy after all.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Quite the view up here, isn’t it? Look how far\nyou can see!\c\nA shame you can’t make out Circhester, but I\nsuppose that’s only reasonable.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Just now I slipped and fell on my rear, but I\nwasn’t a bit hurt.\r\nThank goodness I layered up properly![VAR 0114(0015)]
Ahaha! The moment we get near the water,\nLapras looks ready for a swim.\r\nPerhaps it’s time for a break from training.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Whoever named this place was spot on—it’s like\nstanding in the bottom of a curry pot!\c\nA fine place to train oneself to face the harshest\nof environments with a stiff upper lip![VAR 0114(0015)]
It gets so hot in the Isle of Armor sunlight—\nit makes me break out in sweat!\c\nI just want to spend the daytime clinging to my\nnice, cool Lapras.[VAR 0114(0015)]
It’s quite gloomy with all these clouds, isn’t it?\nTake care you don’t trip over a rock or a\r\nSlowpoke lying around.[VAR 0114(0015)]
What a cool, refreshing rain!\nLapras is loving the chance to soak in it, too![VAR 0114(0015)]
Goodness me, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nIsn’t this sand something?\c\nThanks to my hat and muffler, though,\nit’s nothing too awful.[VAR 0114(0015)]
I suspect you might find some unusual Pokémon\nin mist-erious weather like this![VAR 0114(0015)]
Lanla lalala.
Gah!\c\nWhen I run into you, it’s usually a sign things are\nabout to get sticky...[VAR 0114(0016)]
I’ve got my own business to take care of, so\nI won’t be hangin’ around with you this time.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Seems like a lot of different Pokémon make this\nplace their habitat—just like the Wild Area.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I’m no Leon, but I’m really gettin’ turned around\nin this forest.\r\nMight just call a Flying Taxi, if it comes to that.[VAR 0114(0016)]
That red tower’s dead cool lookin’, innit?\nBut it’s givin’ off a real Fightin’-type vibe, so I’m\r\nkeepin’ my distance...[VAR 0114(0016)]
It’s so dim and cool in here... Feels perfect!\nSounds get pretty muffled, though. Not the\r\ngreatest concert acoustics.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Look at this—a deep blue ocean of pain...\c\nI’m sure if Marnie were here, she’d be whinin’\nabout wantin’ to have a swim.\c\nMe, though, I don’t like swimmin’ much. I hate\ngettin’ sunburnt.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Alone we stand, Obstagoon and me,\nwith these silent sands for company...\c\nHeh. Think this place just gave me the idea for\nmy next song.[VAR 0114(0016)]
It’s just too sunny out today. I’m not havin’ it.\nI don’t mind the humidity, but the heat’s all\r\nthe way up to eleven.[VAR 0114(0016)]
You’d think the moves of Dark types would\nget wicked strong on gloomy, gray days\r\nlike this, yeah?\r\nBut you’d be wrong.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Look at you. All full of beans, even in this soakin’\nwet rain.\c\nHope Marnie brought an umbrella if she’s out\nand about...[VAR 0114(0016)]
Seein’ a sandstorm takes me back to battlin’\nRaihan in the Finals.[VAR 0114(0016)]
We could take cover in the fog, then lash out\nsuddenly with Sucker Punch...\c\nI’m thinkin’ up ways we could win without needin’\nto Dynamax.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Shou ou out!
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]?!\nWhat’re you doin’ here?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Actually, don’t bother answerin’—I can tell.\nYou’re here for the same reason as me, ain’t ya?\r\nThat’s why yer my rival.[VAR 0114(000D)]
If I let Morpeko loose in this thick grass, I’ll lose\nsight of it right away. Gotta keep a close eye...[VAR 0114(000D)]
Y’know those Pokémon up there flitting from tree\nto tree... Emolga?\r\nKinda look like Morpeko, don’t they?[VAR 0114(000D)]
What’s that red building s’posed to be for?\nIt looks cool in those Spikemuth Gym colors...[VAR 0114(000D)]
Dark, cramped places like this kinda calm me\ndown a bit.\r\nIt’s like bein’ back home in Spikemuth.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Look at that gorgeous ocean! Wouldn’t it be\ngreat to all go have a swim?\c\nOn the other hand, Grimmsnarl’d probably take\nyonks to dry out after...[VAR 0114(000D)]
I’m trainin’ to walk steady even on tricky ground\nlike this!\r\nWhy not give it a try?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Ain’t this a nice breeze, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nThis is just the type of weather that’d make my\r\nbro stay shut up inside.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Pretty dark, ain’t it? Looks like we might have\nrain comin’.\c\nThis is just the type of weather that’d get\nmy brother amped up.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Even on rainy days like this, you gotta give it all\nyou’ve got!\c\nToxicroak’s all right thanks to Dry Skin, but as for\nyou, watch out you don’t catch cold![VAR 0114(000D)]
Man, this sand stings!\nWonder if a Pokémon’s pair of Safety Goggles’d\r\nwork for me...[VAR 0114(000D)]
Whoa! [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]?!\nDon’t scare me like that!\c\nI can’t see a thing in this fog.\nThought you were a ghost or somethin’...[VAR 0114(000D)]
Urara. ♪
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]!\nDrawn in by my charisma, were you?\c\nSince you’re here, let’s jump right into a battle![VAR 0114(0017)]
If only...\c\nFact is I’m in the middle of some top-secret\ntraining now. I’m gonna beat you and Leon both.\r\nI hope you’re ready for it![VAR 0114(0017)]
When it comes to putting dragon Pokémon to\ngood use, I’m not picky about their types.\c\nThere’re Pokémon perfect for the job all over the\nplace. Probably even in the tall grass over there.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Ahh, the forest here on the Isle of Armor is so\nhot and steamy... It’s perfect!\c\nMakes me wish I could somehow capture this\nhumidity to use in battle![VAR 0114(0017)]
Look at this place... Talk about a selfie spot!\c\nI wonder which is higher, this mountain or the\nroof of Hammerlocke Stadium?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Cave ceilings can get awfully low sometimes, eh?\c\nBetter not let any of my fans catch a shot of me\nbanging my head on one...[VAR 0114(0017)]
Picture this: a Pokémon battle on the beach,\nwith the big beautiful ocean in the background...\r\nand me winning, of course.\r\nI can hear the likes rolling in already![VAR 0114(0017)]
I don’t know if it’s conducting heat from the sand\nor what, but Duraludon’s as scalding hot as a\r\npot of curry on the flame right now.\c\nWatch your hands, or you’ll get burned![VAR 0114(0017)]
The sun sure is something here on\nthe Isle of Armor, isn’t it?\c\nA person ought to be careful they don’t overheat\nif they’re walking around out here at midday.[VAR 0114(0017)]
The island gives off a whole different vibe under\nheavy clouds like these.\c\nReminds me of the time you fended off the\nDarkest Day![VAR 0114(0017)]
Here comes the rain, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nFeel its cold dampness soak into your body...\c\nMy Sliggoo evolved into Goodra on a day just\nlike this.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Let the winds blow!\nStream forward, Sandstorm!\c\nNah, just having you on...[VAR 0114(0017)]
Man it’s gotten foggy out here...\nI’ll pass on the Misty Terrain, thanks—I’d rather\r\nnot have my Dragon-type moves get all weak.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Alloy!
Huh? Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nDidn’t think I’d run into you out here![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m hard at work surveying the island, really.\nI’ve only been skiving off the teeniest bit.\r\nHardly at all![VAR 0114(0005)]
The Pokémon live totally different out here than\nthey do back in the Wild Area near home.\r\nYou can tell even in these little patches of grass![VAR 0114(0005)]
This is one maze of a forest.\c\nYou can hardly blame that Lilligant for losing\ntrack of its Petilil.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m absolutely shattered from that climb...\nBut what a view you get from up here![VAR 0114(0005)]
How’d a strange cave like this come about\nnaturally, I wonder?\r\nMaybe the river carved it out?[VAR 0114(0005)]
The Isle of Armor’s got such nice beaches!\nWish I’d brought my swim gear...\r\nF-for surveying, obviously! Aquatic surveying![VAR 0114(0005)]
Sand, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nThere’s sand everywhere, mate!\r\nIn my shoes! Between my toes! Like everywhere![VAR 0114(0005)]
We’ve been walking around for ages, so it’s good\nto just stop sometimes, you know?\r\nDubwool seems to feel the same![VAR 0114(0005)]
These sure look like rain clouds to me...\nIf they were a bit whiter, they’d look comfy\r\nenough to kip on—just like Dubwool’s wool![VAR 0114(0005)]
I bet Pokémon that live by the water just love\nthese kinds of rainy days.\c\nWatch your step as you explore, though—the\nground’s all muddy and slippery![VAR 0114(0005)]
Owww... I got sand in my eye!\nI’m getting flashbacks to Hammerlocke Gym...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Check it out, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nIsn’t this fog just like in the Slumbering Weald?\r\nThere could be Legendary Pokémon about![VAR 0114(0005)]
Memeeeh!

Do you like taking your Pokémon for a stroll?
All right! Have a nice long walk together!
All right! Inside the ball it is, then!
You decided to have your lead Pokémon walk\naround with you on the Isle of Armor!
You decided to keep your Pokémon in its ball as\nyou walk around!

Why, hello there! I’m just someone who makes it\nso that you can use Pokémon brought over from\r\nother regions in Ranked Battles!
But! In order for them to participate in Ranked\nBattles, they’ll need to forget all their moves\r\nand learn new ones that can be used in\r\nRanked Battles instead!
Do you have Pokémon from other regions that\nyou would like to have participate in\r\nRanked Battles?
So then, which Pokémon would you like to have\nparticipate in Ranked Battles?
[VAR 1003][VAR 0102(0001)] will need to forget all the\nmoves it knows and learn new ones that it can\r\nuse in Ranked Battles. Is that OK?
They won’t be able to recall any rare moves\nthat they know right now. Are you sure you’re\r\nOK with that?
Oh, it looks like [VAR 0102(0001)] is ready to\nparticipate in Ranked Battles already!\c\nIsn’t that just grand?
All right!\nThen let the lesson begin!
Now [VAR 0102(0001)] is all ready for\nRanked Battles!
See you again sometime!

This must be your first visit to the Crown Tundra.\nAm I right?
I’m researching Pokémon biology around here.
A number of ancient and rare Pokémon have\nbeen spotted in the Crown Tundra, you see.
If I update your Pokédex for you, will you help\nme research what species appear here?
Your Pokédex is being updated...\c\n... ... ...\n... ... ...
The Crown Tundra Pokédex has been added to\nyour Pokédex!
Do your best to complete your new Crown\nTundra Pokédex!
Do you want to show me your Crown\nTundra Pokédex?
Do you want to show me your completed Crown\nTundra Pokédex again?
Oh, that’s too bad.
OK! Let me see.
Your current progress on the Crown Tundra\nPokédex is...
[VAR 0202(0000)] Pokémon seen and [VAR 0202(0001)] Pokémon caught!
Haha. No worries.\nYou just got your Crown Tundra Pokédex!\c\nGood luck! I’m cheering for you.
Haha. You’re still new to this area, but you’re\ndoing well!\c\nThe kinds of Pokémon you can encounter will be\ndifferent from place to place.\c\nOn snowy paths, in caves, on top of mountains,\nand everywhere else...\c\nIf you want to meet many different Pokémon,\nwalk around everywhere!
What? You already caught 30 Pokémon?\nYou’re making good progress.\c\nBy the way, do you pay attention to the weather?\c\nIf it’s sunny or rainy or if there’s a hailstorm or\neven a raging sandstorm...\c\nDepending on the weather, you’ll encounter\ndifferent Pokémon.
Have you already caught 50 Pokémon?\nSo fast!\c\nYou’ve already caught about a quarter of the\nPokémon here.\c\nKeep exploring the Crown Tundra, but be careful\nin the snow.
You’ve been steadily increasing the number of\nPokémon in your Pokédex!\c\nIf you use Quick Balls to quickly catch Pokémon,\nI bet you’ll have caught more than 100\r\ndifferent Pokémon in no time!
You’ve caught 100 Pokémon so fast!\nI was right about asking you to help me with\r\nmy research.\c\nYou’re about halfway there.\nKeep up the good work for the latter half, too.
It’s so fun to look at a Pokédex filled\nwith information.\c\nIt looks like you’ve been to many places—by the\nwater, in caves, and on mountaintops.\c\nKeep on doing what you’ve been doing, and\nfinish your Crown Tundra Pokédex!
I’ve never seen a Crown Tundra Pokédex\nthat’s been filled this much!\c\nYou must be fishing, too! It’s a great way to find\nPokémon, but it’s easily overlooked, isn’t it?
You’re getting so close to completing your\nCrown Tundra Pokédex!\c\nYou no longer need my advice.\c\nI believe you can do it. I’ll be waiting for you!
Congratulations! You finally did it!
You completed your Crown Tundra Pokédex!
Thanks to your hard work, I made remarkable\nprogress on my research.
I’m so glad that I asked you to help me!
To commemorate your great achievement, let me\nadd something special to your League Card!
Done!
Please also take this as a token of my gratitude!
You’ve done something not everyone can do!\nCongratulations!
Hehehe! I can’t get tired of looking at this\nawesome Crown Tundra Pokédex!\c\nCongratulations!
Oh? That Pokémon...
Is that the Hex Nut Pokémon [VAR 0101(0001)]?!
It’s a Mythical Pokémon you can’t find anywhere\nin the Galar region.
Thank you for showing me [VAR 0101(0001)].\nPlease take this as a token of my gratitude!
It’s a hex nut cap to go with your Hex Nut\nPokémon. Isn’t that cute?
You got [VAR 1302(0001,0000)][VAR 01C2(0001)] [VAR FF00(0008)][VAR 01C1(0002)][VAR FF00(0000)]!

Oi oi, Chief! How goes the adventurin’?\nAnything to report?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Doesn’t look like you’ve got any fresh progress\nto report on this one yet![VAR 0114(0076)]
Got anythin’ else legendary you wanna\ntalk about?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Whoa! You’ve given me a report on\n[VAR 0101(0001)] already![VAR 0114(0076)]
The legend of the King of Bountiful Harvests
The legendary giants
The legendary bird Pokémon
Could I get some adventure hints?
Calyrex
Regirock
Regice
Registeel
Regieleki
Regidrago
Articuno
Zapdos
Moltres
Never mind
Oho, changed your mind?\nIt happens! Gahaha![VAR 0114(0076)]
Look at that! You’ve already reported\neverything there is to report on that one![VAR 0114(0076)]
Wait—you really caught [VAR 0101(0001)]\nfrom the legends?!\r\nThat’s ultra-mega-brilliant! Report away![VAR 0114(0076)]
Hmmm...\nSo that’s Articuno, is it? The Legendary\r\nPokémon that can manipulate ice?[VAR 0114(0076)]
I definitely see the resemblance, but it’s got this\ndodgy mask on and everything...\r\nand it hardly seems cold at all, does it?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Oh well!\nIt’s got one ultra-mega-icy gaze![VAR 0114(0076)]
That’s Articuno enough for me, anyway.\nLet’s call this expedition a success![VAR 0114(0076)]
Hmmm...\nSo that’s Zapdos, is it? The Legendary\r\nPokémon that can cause thunderstorms?[VAR 0114(0076)]
I definitely see the resemblance, but those legs\nlook thicker than I expected...\r\nand it’s not exactly electrifyin’, is it?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Oh well!\nIt’s as spiky and as long-beaked as I hoped for![VAR 0114(0076)]
That’s Zapdos enough for me, I s’pose.\nLet’s mark this expedition complete![VAR 0114(0076)]
Hmmm...\nSo that’s Moltres, is it? The Legendary\r\nPokémon that’s the embodiment of fire?[VAR 0114(0076)]
I definitely see the resemblance, but it’s not at\nall hot to the touch...\r\nKinda looks like it’d be more at home with\r\nthe punks in Spikemuth than in a volcano,\r\ndoesn’t it?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Oh well! Looks a bit like it’s burnin’ if you don’t\nlook too close![VAR 0114(0076)]
That’s Moltres enough for me, I s’pose.\nLet’s call that an expedition well done![VAR 0114(0076)]
Hmmm...you’re sayin’ this great craggy thing’s\nRegirock, the rock giant?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Is it just me, or does it bear a strikin’\nresemblance to our Grass-type Gym Leader?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Look at those broad, burly shoulders! This fella\nand Milo are a proper pair of boulders![VAR 0114(0076)]
Well, it’s rocky and gianty enough, I s’pose!\nLet’s call this expedition successful![VAR 0114(0076)]
Hmmm...you’re sayin’ this great frozen-stiff\nthing’s Regice, the ice giant?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Is it just me, or does it look like it’d make one\nultra-mega-dazzlin’ chandelier? Wish I could\r\nlight it up and show it to darlin’ Nia![VAR 0114(0076)]
That aside, look how massive and mighty it is!\nGives me the chills just lookin’ at it,\r\nI don’t mind sayin’![VAR 0114(0076)]
Well, it’s icy and gianty—I’ll give you that!\nLet’s consider this expedition complete![VAR 0114(0076)]
Hmmm...you’re sayin’ this great smooth thing’s\nRegisteel, the steel giant?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Is it just me, or does its top half look a bit like a\nmassive bowling ball?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Look at that blank, inscrutable mug, though...\nYou can’t guess what’s goin’ through its head![VAR 0114(0076)]
Well, it’s steely and gianty enough, I s’pose!\nLet’s call this an expedition well done![VAR 0114(0076)]
Hmmm...you’re sayin’ this great crackly thing’s\nRegieleki, the electric giant?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Y’know what it reminds me of? That colorful\ncandy that pops and fizzes and crackles in\r\nyour mouth![VAR 0114(0076)]
Imagine the balance it must take to stay\nupright with that constantly shiftin’ body!\r\nGives me the shivers, I don’t mind saying![VAR 0114(0076)]
Well, it looks electric and gianty enough.\nExpedition successful, I s’pose![VAR 0114(0076)]
Hmmm...you’re sayin’ this great jagged thing’s\nRegidrago, the dragon giant?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Is it just me, or does it look like it’d pack a really\nstrong pinch?\r\nIt’s a bit like a massive clothespin, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(0076)]
I’d better not go provokin’ it—doubt it’d have a\nbit of trouble openin’ wide and snappin’ me up![VAR 0114(0076)]
I s’pose I’d say that’s a dragony giant!\nMay as well call this expedition a success![VAR 0114(0076)]
Th-that...that...[VAR 0114(0076)]
that noggin’s MASSIVE![VAR 0114(0076)]
I-is that the King of Bountiful Harvests?\nThe one callin’ the shots around here?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Huh. I could swear I’ve seen it before...\nOr then again, maybe not...[VAR 0114(0076)]
A-anyway!\nIt’s definitely regal of it to have a steed...[VAR 0114(0076)]
and that massive head does sort of resemble\na crown![VAR 0114(0076)]
It’s kingly enough, at any rate!\nLet’s just call this a successful expedition![VAR 0114(0076)]
Looks like you’ve reported all there is to\nreport on Legendary Clue 1 and the King of\r\nBountiful Harvests![VAR 0114(0076)]
Looks like you’ve reported all there is to report\non Legendary Clue 2 and the legendary giants![VAR 0114(0076)]
Looks like you’ve reported all there is to report\non Legendary Clue 3 and the legendary birds![VAR 0114(0076)]
Smashin’!\nI’ll mark this expedition done![VAR 0114(0076)]
Crack on with solvin’ those legends, Chief!\nYou’ve expeditions to...expedite![VAR 0114(0076)]
Looks like that’s about all the reportin’ you’ve\ngot to report just now!\c\nGo give those other legends a nice,\nthorough investigatin’![VAR 0114(0076)]
Which adventure’s got you feelin’ stuck?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Ah, the legend of the King of Bountiful Harvests?\nThis one’s a head-scratcher for sure!\c\nMake sure you’ve had a gander at the statue in\ntown and heard everythin’ the townsfolk have\r\ngot to say, for starters!\c\nNever hurts to open up your Town Map and\ncheck your Legendary Clue to take a fresh look\r\nfrom square one, either![VAR 0114(0076)]
Right—the legendary giants!\nWhich one’s givin’ you trouble?[VAR 0114(0076)]
The giant of rock
The giant of ice
The giant of steel
The two giants
Well, all these giants are sleepin’ in ruins, so\nyou’ll have to find those ruins before you can\r\ndo anythin’!\c\nTry and track down the buildin’ I drew for you![VAR 0114(0076)]
Havin’ a spot of trouble gettin’ the door to the\nrock giant’s ruins open, are you?\c\nSo, it says to [VAR FF00(0006)]let the first Pokémon hold a\nnever-changin’ stone[VAR FF00(0000)], eh...?\c\nWell, why not try havin’ your ultra-mega-lead\nPokémon hold on to that stone or whatever it is?\c\nHaven’t you got anythin’ like that?\nA stone that just stays the same forever?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Havin’ a spot of trouble gettin’ the door to the\nice giant’s ruins open, are you?\c\nSo you’ve got to [VAR FF00(0006)]walk together with a livin’\ncrystal of snow[VAR FF00(0000)], is that it?\c\nWell, if it’s a livin’ thing, I reckon it’s got to be\na Pokémon, innit?\c\nMaybe if you take a snow-crystal-lookin’\nPokémon by for a stroll and show what good\r\nmates you are, the door’ll swing on open![VAR 0114(0076)]
Havin’ a spot of trouble gettin’ the door to the\nsteel giant’s ruins open, are you?\c\nSo it says to [VAR FF00(0006)]let ring out the piercin’ note that\nwill wake the giant of steel[VAR FF00(0000)], does it...?\c\nI suppose giant or no, a Pokémon’s a Pokémon!\nIf you make a sound that brings Pokémon\r\nrunnin’, maybe the door’ll open on up for you![VAR 0114(0076)]
Havin’ a spot of trouble gettin’ the door to the\ntwo giants’ ruins open, are you?\c\nLet me get this straight... [VAR FF00(0006)]“When gather the three\ngiants, the door of destiny shall be opened”[VAR FF00(0000)]?\c\nEr, Chief?\nNot to be too blunt, but...this one’s just what it\r\nsays on the tin!\c\nGo get to work findin’ those other three giants\nfirst. Save this one for later![VAR 0114(0076)]
So you’ve got the door open but haven’t\nactually had a run-in with the giant yet?\c\nIt must be pretty dark in there, innit?\nMaybe the giant’s still havin’ a kip...\c\nWhy not see if there’s a switch or somethin’ in\nthere that you can hit to brighten things up?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Aha, the legend of the bird Pokémon!\c\nFor starters, you ought to try headin’ to that\nmassive red tree growin’ waaay down at the\r\nsouthern end of the tundra![VAR 0114(0076)]
Aha, the legend of the bird Pokémon!\nWhich one’s givin’ you a hard time?[VAR 0114(0076)]
The orange bird Pokémon
The black bird Pokémon
The purple bird Pokémon
Ah, that orange bird Pokémon that’s sprintin’\naround the Wild Area!\c\nIt’s ultra-mega-speedy, accordin’ to the people\nwho’ve seen it!\c\nBut however quick those legendary legs are,\nit’s still a Pokémon in the end!\c\nThat means, sooner or later, it’s bound to\nget knackered!\r\nYou’re lookin’ at a contest of endurance, Chief![VAR 0114(0076)]
Ah, that black bird Pokémon that’s flyin’ around\nthe Isle of Armor!\c\nJust chasin’ it down won’t get you anywhere if it\nsoars up and out of reach, eh?\c\nBetter try and get ahead of it to give it a scare!\nOnce it catches sight of you, it might get\r\ncheesed off enough to take a swoop at you![VAR 0114(0076)]
Ah, that purple bird Pokémon that’s flyin’ around\nthe Crown Tundra!\c\nI’ve heard if you chase it down, it makes copies\nof itself to throw you off, then does a runner!\c\nYou’ll just have to keep your hair on and see past\nthe Pokémon’s tricks to get to the real thing!\c\nBut if I know you, Chief, you’re more than up to\nthe challenge![VAR 0114(0076)]

Would you like to embark upon a\nDynamax Adventure?
Yes, please!
How does this work again?
No, thanks
According to my notes, it seems you might know\nhow to find certain special Pokémon.\c\nWhich Pokémon would you like to set out to\nfind today?
According to my records, you’ve previously\ncaught [VAR 0101(0000)]. Isn’t that right?\c\n[VAR FF00(0001)]You won’t be able to catch it again[VAR FF00(0000)], even if\nyou find it once more. Would you still like to\r\nembark on this adventure?
My records indicate that last time you went on\nan adventure, you found [VAR 0101(0000)].\c\nI noted where you found it, so you can try to\ntake on [VAR 0101(0000)] once more.\r\nWhat would you like to look for this time?
[VAR 0101(0000)]
Anything is fine
To take part in a Dynamax Adventure and\nexplore the Max Lair here, you will need to use\r\none of our rental Pokémon.
You and three other Trainers will work together\nas a group, coming to a consensus to decide\r\nwhich path to take.\c\nMake your way in as far as you can, in the hopes\nof reaching the Legendary Pokémon that lurk in\r\nthe furthest depths, Dynamaxed and waiting!
[~ 12]
If you go on a Dynamax Adventure, I will provide\nyou with Dynite Ore as a reward.\c\nI’ll also allow you to keep one—just one—of the\nPokémon you catch along the way.
Oh, you quit your last Dynamax Adventure\nwithout finishing it, didn’t you?\c\nIt’s not really fair to your teammates to hang\nthem out to dry like that.\r\nTry to stick it out next time!
It seems that you keep quitting your Dynamax\nAdventures midway through...\r\nThat sort of thing is hard on your teammates.\c\nBefore I let you join another team, I’m going to\nask that you give me [VAR 0201(0000)] piece[VAR 1101(0000,0100)]s of Dynite Ore\r\nto show that you’re serious. Can you do that?
Until you can prove your dedication, you can’t\ntake part in any more Dynamax Adventures.
You don’t have enough Dynite Ore.
You can collect Dynite Ore by taking part in\nMax Raid Battles in the Crown Tundra.
Try to make sure that you see your future\nDynamax Adventures through to the end.
Well done defeating that tough opponent!\nI hope we’ll see you again soon.
Well done facing such a tough opponent!\nVictory seemed so close—I could almost\r\ntaste it!
Would you like me to jot down where you found\n[VAR 0101(0000)] this time so that you might\r\nchallenge it again?
Oh dear, it looks as though I’ve run out of space\nfor any more notes here...\c\nAre there any older records you wouldn’t mind\nme erasing?
In that case, I simply won’t mark down where\nyou found [VAR 0101(0000)] this time.
Very well. Then I’ll scrub out [VAR 0101(0001)]\nhere and jot down [VAR 0101(0000)] instead.
There we go!\nAll nice and properly noted for the future!
I look forward to working with you again soon!
Oh, that’s a bit of a letdown, isn’t it?\nI hope you’ll come and give it another go soon!
Welcome back.\c\nWould you like us to keep a record of where you\nfound [VAR 0101(0000)] this time?
Roger that! I’ll write it down for you.
Then I won’t bother keeping my notes about\nwhere you found [VAR 0101(0000)].
Hm?\nOh. You, huh?\c\nI appreciate the hello, but you’re not ready yet\nfor what I’ve got to offer.\c\nTry me again when you’ve got some more of\nthese Dynamax Adventures under your belt.
So...how about it?\nYou like Dynamax Adventures?
Course you do, clever la[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]dss!\nYou’ve taken on loads of ’em, after all!
Hmph... Have it your way, then...
For someone as skilled at Dynamax Adventures\nas you are, I’ve thought up a little something\r\nspecial: an Endless Dynamax Adventure.\c\nWhat do you say? You interested?
You want to give an Endless Dynamax Adventure\na go, friend?
What’s my record?
An Endless Dynamax Adventure is just what it\nsounds like: endless!\c\nEven after you defeat one of the special\nPokémon that lie within, you can keep going\r\nonward to see how far you can push yourself!
All the Pokémon you catch in this mode’ll be\ngoing toward my research, I’m afraid, so I won’t\r\nbe letting you keep any after the fact.\c\nBut in return, I’ll load you up with even more\nDynite Ore than you usually get.
And of course we’ll keep records of how far you\nmake it, so try to push yourself to your limits,\r\ntogether with your mates!
Let me know whenever you’re up for a challenge.
Now THAT is what I call a fine performance!\nYou set a new record! I keep track, you know.
I’ll keep a record of how far you made it this\ntime, so let me know if you want to try to best\r\nit sometime.
Here it is. Your best record so far is...
Keep it up if you hope to do even better.
[~ 47]
Oh, hey! It’s you, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nListen—I’ve found [VAR 0101(0001)] down in the\nMax Lair![VAR 0114(0078)]
If you like, I’ll tell you where [VAR 0101(0001)] is\nin exchange for [VAR 0202(0002)] piece[VAR 1101(0002,0100)]s of Dynite Ore![VAR 0114(0078)]
Wait a sec—you’ve got loads of Pokémon\nlocations written down already!\r\nBetter clear one out, hadn’t you?[VAR 0114(0078)]
Wait a sec, [VAR 0100(0000)]—\nyou’ve already caught [VAR 0101(0001)]!\c\nI can show you where to find [VAR 0101(0001)]\nfor [VAR 0202(0002)] piece[VAR 1101(0002,0100)]s of Dynite Ore if you like—\r\nyou just won’t be able to catch it! Sound OK?[VAR 0114(0078)]
Peonia told you where to find [VAR 0101(0001)]!
Hang on, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nBit short on Dynite Ore, aren’t you?[VAR 0114(0078)]
Hmm... Well, gosh, I feel like taking pity on you\nthis time!\r\nJust this once, I’ll give you the scoop for free![VAR 0114(0078)]
Oh, wait, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nYou already know where [VAR 0101(0001)] is![VAR 0114(0078)]
Are you absolutely certain?\nDon’t come crying to me if you regret it later![VAR 0114(0078)]
You can kick things off by talking to that\nscientist lady. Go get ’em![VAR 0114(0078)]
Oh, hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]. You all right?\nMe, I’m carrying on like usual, I suppose.[VAR 0114(0078)]
By the way, I picked up this odd thing in the\nMax Lair. You can have it.[VAR 0114(0078)]
You got [VAR 1302(0001,0000)][VAR 01C2(0001)] [VAR FF00(0008)][VAR 01C1(0002)][VAR FF00(0000)]!
Don’t worry—go ahead and take it!\nIt’s not really my cup of tea anyway![VAR 0114(0078)]
Why d’you think so many Legendary Pokémon\nhang around in the Max Lair anyway?[VAR 0114(0078)]
According to that scientist lady, the first\nLegendary Pokémon sighted down here\r\nwas [VAR 0101(0000)].[VAR 0114(0078)]
That scientist lady apparently used to work at a\nlab in the Alola region!\c\nDoesn’t Alola sound absolutely brilliant?\nJust think... All the malasadas you could eat![VAR 0114(0078)]
I really want to use an Ability Patch on my\ndear Tyrantrum.\c\nThat’d give it a much easier time using\nHead Smash. It sure loves that move![VAR 0114(0078)]
The trick to having a good Dynamax Adventure?\c\nWell, using moves like Reflect or Light Screen to\nstave off some damage is a big help.[VAR 0114(0078)]
The trick to having a good Dynamax Adventure?\c\nWell, I guess you ought to keep a close eye on\nhow the Pokémon inside handle different types![VAR 0114(0078)]
The trick to having a good Dynamax Adventure?\c\nWell, you can really turn up the excitement by\nusin’ a move like Max Knuckle to raise ally\r\nPokémon’s Attack stats![VAR 0114(0078)]
Hey, have you heard the rumors about this great\nbig tree, the Dyna Tree?\c\nApparently, something nice happens if you give it\na good shake!\c\nI don’t think I’ve got the arms for it, but I bet you\ncould shake it up good, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0078)]
You know how Pokémon down in the Max Lair\nare always Dynamaxing?\c\nThink there’s some massive Wishing Star deep\nunderground or something?[VAR 0114(0078)]
How’re your legend-hunting expeditions with my\nold man going?\c\nYou don’t need to take ’em too seriously.\nHe’s not the most responsible guy, after all.[VAR 0114(0078)]
That bloke over there’s a bit funny, isn’t he?\nProbably not as funny as my old man,\r\nto be fair...[VAR 0114(0078)]
Hey, have you heard the rumors about this\nlong-haired woman?\c\nApparently, night after night, she visits a grave in\nthe tundra, always looking for something...[VAR 0114(0078)]
So I was once on this Dynamax Adventure,\nand my teammate’s Oranguru had the\r\nmove Instruct.\c\nThat move let it give the other Pokémon orders.\nIt was a massive help!
Sablish!
We have Pokémon helping us out with our\ninvestigations, too, you know.
Dott dott.
Dot dot dot.
Ditt dott.
Perhaps it’s measuring something?\nThe readings seem to be fluctuating.
It’s probably not a good idea to head in here\nalone... Let’s turn back for now.
You decide to head back to the entrance,\nkeeping an eye out on the way.\r\nMaybe you’ll spot Peony’s daughter somewhere!

Ms. Oleana?!
A ghost?!
Oh my. Champion?\nI didn’t expect to find you here.[VAR 0114(0007)]
I beg your pardon? There is no ghost here—\nonly a now-mildly-peeved Oleana.[VAR 0114(0007)]
But what a stroke of luck.\nYou may just have the information I need.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Word has reached me that Chairman Rose has\nsupposedly been seen in these parts.[VAR 0114(0007)]
I know full well that cannot be true, but I could\nnot help but come and investigate.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Would you happen to know anything about\nMr. Rose somehow being here in this tundra?[VAR 0114(0007)]
I think I might...
Sorry, I don’t
You do?! What do you know?\nTell me straightaway![VAR 0114(0007)]
No, I suppose you would not.\nThings are never as simple as that...[VAR 0114(0007)]

These are exactly what I was looking for!\c\nI knew my hypothesis was spot on![VAR 0114(000B)]
Hm? Wait...\n[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]?![VAR 0114(000B)]
What are you doing in a place like this?![VAR 0114(000B)]

What are YOU doing here?
Are you having me on? This freezing place?\c\nHardly the kind of locale I’d pick to go\nexploring, if it were up to me...[VAR 0114(000B)]
I keep asking myself that exact same question!\c\nIf I’d known it was going to be this cold here,\nI would’ve thought things through a bit more...[VAR 0114(000B)]
But here I am, stuck in the Crown Tundra, trying\nto learn more about a group of Pokémon.[VAR 0114(000B)]
There are some Pokémon that prefer places\nwhere there are no people, you see—Pokémon\r\nthat choose to live in isolation.[VAR 0114(000B)]
The Crown Tundra here is just the place for that\nsort of Pokémon.[VAR 0114(000B)]
If my theory is correct...[VAR 0114(000B)]
then I think a certain trio of Legendary Pokémon\ncould be lurking somewhere in these lands![VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m sure my theory’s not wrong. If you want some\nproof, then look there! See those [VAR FF00(0006)]footprints[VAR FF00(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000B)]
My theory is that the legendary Iron Will\nPokémon, Cavern Pokémon, and Grassland\r\nPokémon are all somewhere out here in the\r\nCrown Tundra![VAR 0114(000B)]
And there’s [VAR FF00(0006)]evidence[VAR FF00(0000)] like this scattered all over\nthe place that’ll lead us to them![VAR 0114(000B)]
If we could find more evidence and collect\n100 percent of the data needed to track these\r\nLegendary Pokémon, then I bet we could use\r\nmy Pokémon Finder to figure out what habitats\r\nthey’re living in![VAR 0114(000B)]
But this place is wicked cold, and it’s putting me\nin hibernation mode...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Are you planning to stick around here for a\nwhile, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Think you could try to spot more evidence like\nthis and report it to me when you find it?\r\nI’ll reward you for your hard work, of course![VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ll be waiting in that house there, so I can stay\nwarm and cozy and maybe feel my fingers...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Er, so that I can grip a pen and write, of course!\nSince I’ll be working so hard on my research![VAR 0114(000B)]

Well, let’s see it then!
I’ll take a look later
That training must be keeping you real busy, huh?\nNot that I’m going to let you outshine me![VAR 0114(0005)]
Heh heh, surprised? Don’t worry, mate. I’ll keep\non letting you know whenever I find a cool\r\nPokémon you’ve never managed to see.[VAR 0114(0005)]

Town Records: Tourism Initiatives
I’m done reading
The king was a great Pokémon that brought\nabundance to our cold land.\c\nWith a sweep of its right hand, the land would be\nblanketed in verdant grasses and blooms.\c\nWith a sweep of its left hand, the fruit of the\nfields would ripen and grow heavy.\c\nIts great crown of green gleaming, the king\ngalloped across the land astride its proud steed.\c\nAnd in their footsteps, buds would burst from the\nsoil, and rich life was born across the region.\c\nAnd so we worshiped the Pokémon and paid it\nall due tribute as king.
The horse Pokémon gave over its power to serve\nthe king and carry it hither and thither.\c\nThe two even became one for a time, combining\ntheir strength to create a forest in a single night.\c\nThis proud steed had been a wild thing once,\nravaging the village crops and causing much woe.\c\nBut the king, in all its greatness, brought this\nfierce creature to heel and secured its loyalty.\c\nAnd for each among us who claims the steed’s\nhide was black as the midnight gloom in which\r\n[VAR FF00(0006)]ghosts[VAR FF00(0000)] appear, there is another who claims it was\r\nwhite as a block of solid [VAR FF00(0006)]ice[VAR FF00(0000)].\c\nNone alive can now say which is the truth.
Through these reins did the king send its power,\nin order to tame and control its proud steed.\c\nThe reins, in fact, were made by the hands of\nthe people, in thanks for the plenty brought by\r\nthe king.\c\nThese reins bound not only the horse and the\nking to one another—they bound the people to\r\nthe king as well.\c\nAt the dawning of each new year, we must never\nforget to gift the king with this offering.\c\nLet the radiant flower and the mane of the steed\nbe woven together to bind us all in faith.\c\nLet the secrets of this sacred art be passed\nfrom parent to child to grandchild and\r\nnever forgotten.
While carrots can be grown in the Crown Tundra,\nthey have rather unusual growth habits.\c\nWhen grown beneath the heaped snow,\nthese hardy roots tend to develop into\r\nIceroot Carrots.\c\nWhen grown in tracts close to where many souls\nare laid to rest, Shaderoot Carrots will be\r\nyour crop.\c\nShaderoot Carrots are a favorite treat for many\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Ghost-type[VAR FF00(0000)] Pokémon, while [VAR FF00(0006)]Ice-type[VAR FF00(0000)] Pokémon\r\nseem to delight in eating Iceroot Carrots.\c\nAccording to old fairy tales, the steed that\nthe King of Bountiful Harvests rode upon\r\nloved both of these varieties—or perhaps one\r\nor the other.\c\nRecords seem to contradict one another,\nwith some stories speaking of a white steed\r\ndelighting in Iceroot Carrots and others\r\nmentioning a black steed devouring\r\nShaderoot Carrots.
Isn’t it tough dealing with the cold here on the\ntundra, with temperatures seeming to drop\r\nlower and lower with every passing year?\c\nWhile it’s tempting to stay indoors where it’s\ncozy, don’t forget to move that body, too!\c\nTry the Freezington Snow Samba today, and\nget your body moving to stay warm all winter!\c\n“Lift both hands in the air, wave here, wave\nthere, bow low, touch your toe, and freeze!\r\nThen up we pop to start it all once more!” ♪\c\nForm a circle with friends, and don’t be shy!\nThe Snow Samba will keep you young at heart!
Freezington Souvenir Brainstorming Sessions\n(Minutes taken by the town’s tourism lead)\c\nWe got a lot of submissions in our last round,\nso our thanks to all who contributed ideas.\c\nWe’ve settled on an idea for a new Freezington\nsouvenir sure to lure in more visitors: a shirt\r\nfeaturing our own King of Bountiful Harvests!\c\nBy reusing the artwork from some old documents,\nwe should be able to keep design costs low, too.

Hop! Didn’t expect to see you here today, dear.\nIsn’t this the big day?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Yeah, that’s exactly why I came running over to\nget [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]

Hey! You silly Wooloo! I see what you’re up to!\nDon’t go using Tackle on the fencing![VAR 0114(0005)]

Yeah, yeah, but where’s Lee?\nHave you got him crammed in a cupboard?[VAR 0114(0005)]
He’s still not here yet! For the hundredth time...\nHonestly, Hop, you must learn some patience!
He’s probably only just arrived at the station\nin Wedgehurst.
Then that’s where I’m going!\nYou know Lee is hopeless with directions.\r\nI’ll make sure he doesn’t get lost on the way![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, will you?\nYes, that probably is for the best...

Well, thank you for that!\c\nI hope you’ll all carry on training up your\nPokémon and never shy from battle.\c\nThen come challenge me for the Champion title![VAR 0114(0004)]
We’re on it! We’ve all been working on our battle\nskills just like you’ve taught us to, Lee!

I’m the Galar region’s greatest-ever Pokémon\nChampion—and a massive Charizard fan, too.\c\nPeople call me the unbeatable Leon![VAR 0114(0004)]
Come on, Lee! And you, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nBet I can beat the both of you back home![VAR 0114(0005)]

Just having a Pokémon with you doesn’t make\nyou a real Trainer, you know.\c\nProper Trainers raise their Pokémon up to be\nfirst-rate in battle, too![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, and you think you’re worthy of calling\nyourself such a proper Trainer already, Hop?\c\nGuess I’ll be the judge of that!\c\nLet’s see how you handle yourself in a battle\nagainst your friend, if [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she’s up for it.[VAR 0114(0004)]
What do you say? Willing and ready to take Hop\non in the first-ever Pokémon battle of your life?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Then how about I give you a spot of advice.\c\nYou don’t want to go getting so caught up in\nthings that you forget everything you’ve\r\naccomplished till now.\c\nTake a moment to jot down what you’ve done,\nin order to save a record of your progress![VAR 0114(0004)]
Believe in your partner Pokémon!\nAnd care for them, too, with all your heart.\c\nDo those two things, and I’m certain you’ll learn\nto choose the moves that suit your Pokémon.\c\nAnd more importantly...to have a champion time\nbattling with them![VAR 0114(0004)]
Looks like everyone’s on board, Pokémon and\nTrainers alike? Then let’s do this![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’ve watched every match that Lee’s ever had!\c\nI’ve read every book and magazine he left\nbehind at home, too!\c\nI know exactly what to do in order to win![VAR 0114(0005)]
Well, that was a shock! Guess I know now why\nLee thought he should give you a Pokémon, too...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Sorry, mate.\c\nEven if you did get your Pokémon direct from\na champ like Lee, looks like I’m still the greatest![VAR 0114(0005)]
You and your Pokémon all fought hard.\c\nMade me almost want to let out Charizard and\njoin in on all the fun!\c\nGood effort out there, [VAR 0101(0001)]!\nWhy don’t I get you all sorted?[VAR 0114(0004)]
And, [VAR 0100(0000)], you’ve got real promise!\nIn fact, I’ve got a favor to ask you...\c\nBe a real rival to Hop, would you?\nPush him, and make the both of you stronger![VAR 0114(0004)]

You? Join the [VAR FF00(0006)]Gym Challenge[VAR FF00(0000)]?\c\nYou think you’re ready for the single greatest\ncompetition in the Galar region?\c\nNot putting the cart before the Rapidash there,\nLittle Brother?[VAR 0114(0004)]
If that’s really what you want to do, you two have\na whole lot you need to learn about Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Especially your friend [VAR 0100(0000)].\nBefore you think about getting Gym Badges,\r\nbest to think about getting a Pokédex.[VAR 0114(0004)]
A Trainer’s Pokédex helps them learn lots of\nthings about all the Pokémon out there, including\r\ntheir strengths.\c\nBut it’s more than just a collection of data, you\nknow. It’s a record of a Trainer’s love and passion\r\nfor Pokémon training![VAR 0114(0004)]
Right, right, we get it...\nPokédexes, then! We’re on it!\c\nLooks like it’s off to the Pokémon Research Lab\nfor you and me, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s the kind of enthusiasm a Trainer needs!\nI’ll let the professor know to expect you.[VAR 0114(0004)]
I’m going to be the next Champion, so\ncompleting a simple Pokédex will be nothing!\r\nJust another page in the tale of my legend![VAR 0114(0005)]
You’d probably better go tell your mum that\nwe’re heading out, though.[VAR 0114(0005)]

Hop! [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
Wha—? Lee?\nHow’d you manage to find your way here?\r\nYou’re pants with directions. You always get lost.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, that’s nice to hear from the little brother\nwho had me worried sick!\c\nI’d been waiting ages for you two, and you\nnever showed!\c\nOf course I came looking for the both of you![VAR 0114(0004)]
Wait, where’s the Wooloo?!\nWe were trying to rescue that Wooloo![VAR 0114(0005)]
Meh!
The little chap’s just fine.\c\nThough all of you had fainted by the time I\nfound you here.\c\nYou know this place is out of bounds...\c\nBut it took courage to come in here all the same.\nAnd I can understand well enough why you did it.\c\nYou did good, Hop![VAR 0114(0004)]
And at least that Wooloo’s all right...\nYeah, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nI thought we’d had it when that weird fog started\nrolling in and that mad Pokémon attacked...\r\nbut at least it wasn’t all for nothing![VAR 0114(0005)]
Attacked by some mad Pokémon?\nWhat are you talking about, Hop?[VAR 0114(0004)]
It seemed loads stronger than any Pokémon I’ve\never seen. And it just had this sort of presence...\r\nOur moves didn’t even touch it. I mean, really—\r\nthey seemed to pass right through it![VAR 0114(0005)]
Your moves passed right through it?\c\nSo, the fearsome Pokémon they say live in the\nSlumbering Weald...\r\nAre they actually illusions or something?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Get strong enough and maybe the two of you\ncould be the ones to reveal the truth someday.[VAR 0114(0004)]
For now, let’s simply get out of this place.\nYou’ll be all right now that I’m here with you![VAR 0114(0004)]
Even if we did get an earful from Lee...[VAR 0114(0005)]
what an experience! This’ll make a pretty fine\nfirst page in the tale of my legend![VAR 0114(0005)]

Guess I’ll probably train up [VAR 0101(0001)] a bit by\nhaving it battle against Pokémon in the tall grass.[VAR 0114(0005)]
You should get yourself to the building with the\npurple roof and the great red and white ball\r\nmark out on front.\c\nThat’s the Pokémon Research Lab![VAR 0114(0005)]

I’ve got to give it to Professor Magnolia.\nEverything in here looks fascinating...[VAR 0114(0004)]
Bow wark!
What is it today, Leon?\c\nLooking for info on another never-before-seen,\nsuperstrong Pokémon?\r\nI wish you’d stop with these outlandish requests.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Good to see you, too, Yamper![VAR 0114(0004)]
Yamper here is a real champ when it comes to\nhelping you find your way around.\c\nHe came to my rescue plenty of times back in\nthe day, when I got lost on the road.\c\nOh yeah, and that’s his Trainer, Sonia.\c\nWhat can I say about Sonia?\nWell, I like the way she cooks.\r\nShe makes food you can gobble down in a flash.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Tsk. What kind of an introduction is that?\nDid you forget we were rivals during our\r\nGym Challenge?\c\nIt wasn’t just Yamper helping you out.\nI did, too.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Anyway, nice to meet you! Name’s Sonia.\nI’m the professor’s assistant.[VAR 0114(000B)]
This is [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe’s a new Pokémon Trainer.\nSet h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer on the right path, would you?[VAR 0114(0004)]
*sigh*\nWhat does he think I am? He’s always got his\r\nhead in the clouds. It’s no wonder he gets lost\r\nall the time.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh. Looks like you’ve got a Rotom Phone.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Hey there, Rotom![VAR 0114(000B)]
Bzzzrt!
Rotom Phones are handy little things, aren’t\nthey? They’ve got a map and a navigation tool.\c\nThat said, Leon still gets lost, so...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh, sorry. So tell me, do you know a lot\nabout Pokémon?[VAR 0114(000B)]
You bet!
Not really...
Well said!\c\nIn that case, I’ll make it so that you can use the\n[VAR FF00(0001)]Pokédex[VAR FF00(0000)] on your Rotom Phone![VAR 0114(000B)]
Don’t worry!\c\nHere, I’ll make it so that you can use the\n[VAR FF00(0001)]Pokédex[VAR FF00(0000)] on your Rotom Phone![VAR 0114(000B)]
You obtained the [VAR FF00(0008)]Pokédex[VAR FF00(0000)]!
Just so you know, that Pokédex is a gift\nfrom my gran![VAR 0114(000B)]
Could you let Gran know that you received\nthe Pokédex?\c\nShe lives in the house down along Route 2.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Leon’s a right amazing Champion, and I’m\nbasically just an assistant...\c\nI’m not even Gran’s official assistant, either. I’ve\njust been calling myself one...\r\nSomehow, it makes me feel a little restless.[VAR 0114(000B)]

Hey there, Trainer! Sorry to stop you.
You just left the Pokémon Lab, right?\nSo that means you’ve got a Pokédex, yeah?\c\nI love talking to new Trainers and giving them\nuseful stuff.
It’s a Potion. Use it when your Pokémon’s HP—\ntheir hit points—gets low. HP is like a Pokémon’s\r\nstamina. You can even use Potions during battle.
Knowledge is power! It’s a good idea to talk to\nlots of different people and read everything you\r\ncan on your journey!

Text File : main_event_0220

Got your Pokédex from Sonia?\c\nThen it’s time to meet lots of different Pokémon\nand start building up a strong team![VAR 0114(0005)]
But battling strong Pokémon in the wild can leave\nyour team in a bad way. Not to mention what\r\nbattling another Trainer can do...\r\nLuckily, we’ve got Pokémon Centers![VAR 0114(0005)]
Luckier yet, they’re dead easy to spot.\nThey look the same wherever you go.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nBet you’ve never been inside one![VAR 0114(0005)]

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Level with me, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nIs this your first time in a Pokémon Center?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Yes...
Of course not
Then I don’t think you need me to tell you what\nyou already know.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Then the future Champion’s got you covered![VAR 0114(0005)]
First things first—you talk to the lady at the\ncounter if you want your Pokémon healed up.[VAR 0114(0005)]
And Pokémon you catch are kept in computers\nlike the one you can find here, see?\c\nAfter all, you can only bring six Pokémon with\nyou on the road in your party.[VAR 0114(0005)]
The Potions they sell at the Poké Mart got me\nout of a real rough spot the other day!
If you two kids are Pokémon Trainers, you might\nwant to buy some Potions before you head out!
Cheers! I’m already good, though.\c\nI’m heading to Route 2, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nCome find me, maybe, when you’re done here![VAR 0114(0005)]

Listen, [VAR 0100(0000)]. I’ve been thinking...\c\nIf you’re a Pokémon Trainer now, you must want\nto try your hand at the [VAR FF00(0006)]Gym Challenge[VAR FF00(0000)], right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
The Gym Challenge?
What’s that?
The Gym Challenge, mate!\c\nThe annual competition where Trainers can battle\nit out for the right to challenge the Champion![VAR 0114(0005)]
But the trick is that you’ve got to be endorsed\nif you want to take part.\c\nAnd Lee doesn’t seem to think I’m up to snuff...\c\nSo I’m thinking I ought to talk to the professor\nand see if she could help![VAR 0114(0005)]
You’ve got to take part, too!\c\nA proper rival is just the thing every Trainer\nneeds to keep growing stronger, after all.\r\nKeeps you motivated, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
The professor’s house is way down at the end of\nRoute 2, so let’s head there...and give our teams\r\nthe chance to train up a bit along the way![VAR 0114(0005)]

Over here, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
All right, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nIt’s time we filled in our teams a bit—[VAR 0114(0005)]
And I’m here to teach you how!\c\nYou’ll need to catch Pokémon if you’ve got any\nhope of filling in that Pokédex.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Lee?! Where’d you come from?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Only...look at you, little [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nYou’ve already caught some on your own!\c\nYour mum gave you those Poké Balls, did she?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Every Pokémon has got a type or two, which can\nmake it good against some opponents but poor\r\nagainst others.\c\nThat’s the reason you’ll want to catch different\nPokémon—to cover one another’s weaknesses.\c\nNow, let’s all have a champion time as I show you\nhow it’s done![VAR 0114(0004)]
[~ 6]
[~ 7]
[~ 8]
Typical Lee![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll give you some more Poké Balls. In return, I’ll\nonly ask that you catch plenty of Pokémon!\c\nThe Pokémon around here seem easy to catch.\nAlmost like they’re itching to join some Trainer’s\r\nteam, wouldn’t you say?[VAR 0114(0004)]
The Pokémon on your team will get Exp. Points\nwhen you catch Pokémon, too.[VAR 0114(0005)]
And of course, they get Exp. Points from battle,\nso take on the other Trainers you meet along the\r\npath to help your Pokémon thrive.\c\nYour team will keep on changing and growing\nas you get stronger together, no doubt...\r\nBut even I don’t know exactly how yet!\r\nShow your Champion something good, all right?[VAR 0114(0004)]
All right! I’m gonna catch loads of Pokémon.\nThe professor will be shocked when she sees![VAR 0114(0005)]

Dear me, I’m sorry.\nI didn’t even notice my guests![VAR 0114(0042)]

And you must be [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nI trust you received the Pokédex from Sonia.\nI’m sure you’ll have it complete in no time![VAR 0114(000A)]
You must already know about Dynamaxing,\nright, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Professor Magnolia’s been doing research into\nthe Dynamax phenomenon for years and years.\c\nAnd it takes a proper understanding of the thing\nif you plan to use Dynamaxing to the fullest![VAR 0114(0004)]
There you go again, Leon, always talking\nabout Pokémon.\c\nThere are other things that are worth knowing\nabout, too, you know.\r\nLike how many different types of tea there are![VAR 0114(000A)]
Hey, Professor, do us a favor, would you?\c\nHelp me convince Lee he should endorse us for\nthe Gym Challenge![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh Leon, why wouldn’t you endorse them?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Hop and [VAR 0100(0000)] only just started out\nas Pokémon Trainers...\r\nThere’s still loads they don’t know yet![VAR 0114(0004)]
Dearie, I thought your dream was to have\neveryone in the Galar region become strong\r\nTrainers. Isn’t that right?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Well, yeah...you’re not wrong.\c\nThat goal’s precisely the reason I gave them both\nPokémon, in fact.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Right, then.\nIn that case...how about this?\c\nLet’s see if the two of you can show me such a\nbrilliant battle that I’m left with no choice but\r\nto endorse you.\c\nAnd don’t worry. I’ll make sure both your teams\nare in good shape before the battle starts.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Right!\nI’ll be waiting outside, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Now remember, be sure to give it everything\nyou’ve got.\c\nThat’s the best thing you can do for your\nPokémon—and for yourself, too.[VAR 0114(000A)]

I’m going to become the greatest Pokémon\nTrainer there is!\c\nAnd to do that, I need that endorsement to\ntake part in the Gym Challenge![VAR 0114(0005)]
Come at me with everything you have so we can\nprove to Lee that we’ve got what it takes![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 2]
I’m rather interested in seeing how you two\nyoung Trainers battle, too.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Listen, you two. The reason I’m unbeatable is\nbecause I learn from every battle I see or take\r\npart in. That’s how I’ve gotten to where I am today.\c\nSo show me something good in this battle![VAR 0114(0004)]
We’ll be sure to.\nReady for this, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nTime for a serious match between you and me...\nto fill in another page in the tale of my legend![VAR 0114(0005)]
Of course!
I need to prepare...
It’s time for my legend to begin![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, fine... Guess I can wait a bit.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hurry it up, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nYou’ve gotta battle me so I can get myself\nthat endorsement![VAR 0114(0005)]
You remember what I asked you, don’t you?\c\nI think you’ve got potential, and that’s why I\nwant you to be a real rival to Hop.\r\nAnd that’s direct from your Champion Leon![VAR 0114(0004)]

Hah! See that! I knew I could do it.\nAm I ever glad I could beat you this time![VAR 0114(0005)]
Undefeated!\nAnd my Pokémon’s moves were seriously on point![VAR 0114(0005)]
The sting of defeat and the joy of victory...\c\nI guess going through both is the key to the\ntwo of us getting stronger, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]

[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! Hop!\nWell, after seeing a match like that one...\c\nI suppose I’ve little choice but to give you both\nan endorsement as Champion![VAR 0114(0004)]
Yes! Thanks, Lee! I swear I’m going to win my\nway through the Gym Challenge to reach you![VAR 0114(0005)]
You may both be young still, and plenty rough\naround the edges, but it was a proper battle.\c\nCharizard and I were both feeling the excitement\nin every last cell in our bodies![VAR 0114(0004)]
Hop, you’ve always tended to get caught up in\nthings like how you throw your Poké Ball out...\r\nThings that have nothing to do with real strength.\c\nHonestly, I’d been worried about you still\nobsessing over that sort of nonsense, but it\r\nseems you really have grown a bit, Little Brother![VAR 0114(0004)]
And I’d like to see some more thrilling Pokémon\nbattles out of you, too, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0004)]
All right, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nYou and me are going to train up against one\nanother to aim for that Champion’s title![VAR 0114(0005)]
Absolutely!
Against one another?
The more we keep battling against one another,\nthe more our Pokémon will grow.[VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s the way of it when you’ve got a great rival!\nJust like you’ve got me, and I’ve got you![VAR 0114(0005)]

Huh?\nWhat’s that?![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! Would you look at this?\nThey’re Wishing Stars!\c\nSince there are two of them, you should take\none yourself![VAR 0114(0005)]
With one of these, my Pokémon can Dynamax!\nThey’re gonna be massive! YES![VAR 0114(0005)]
Trust you to pull something like this!\c\nThey say Wishing Stars fall down for those who\nhave a true wish in their heart, you know.[VAR 0114(0004)]
I will be the greatest Trainer ever!\c\nI WILL be the greatest Trainer ever!\c\nI WILL BE THE GREATEST TRAINER EVER!!!\c\nThere! I’ve said it three times, so surely my wish\nwill come true now, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Don’t be silly, Hop.\c\nThose Wishing Stars are composed of a curious\nsort of rock containing unknown power...\c\nThey are one of the most precious resources\nwe have here in the Galar region.\c\nBut they won’t do a thing for you in that state.\nGive them to me now, and I’ll have you sorted.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Ah, right. You’ve done heaps of research on the\nDynamax phenomenon, haven’t you, Professor?\c\nThen please! Give [VAR 0100(0000)] and me the\npower to Dynamax our Pokémon![VAR 0114(0005)]
First we got to battle against that mad Pokémon\nin the Slumbering Weald, and now this...\c\nIt really feels like we’re getting caught up in the\nadventure of a lifetime![VAR 0114(0005)]
I do understand your excitement, young man,\nbut don’t get carried away. You want to save\r\nyour energy for tomorrow’s journey![VAR 0114(000A)]
Seems I came back home right in time for all\nthe excitement![VAR 0114(000B)]

Hop, is it true you really met some Pokémon you\ndidn’t recognize? Is there anything more you\r\ncan tell me about it?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Er, well, there was weird heavy fog, and then this\neven weirder Pokémon appeared...\c\n[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)] tried to fight it off!\nBut then I think we both passed out or something.\r\nIt’s all pretty hazy.[VAR 0114(0005)]

[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], Hop, these are for you.[VAR 0114(000A)]
You got a Dynamax Band from Professor\nMagnolia and slipped it on your wrist!
Those are your Dynamax Bands.\c\nI made them by fitting the Wishing Stars you\nfound last night into those bands.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Thanks, Professor! This is brilliant!\c\nIt’s just like the one Lee has on him, too.\nNow we can Dynamax our Pokémon like he does![VAR 0114(0005)]
My word, you don’t waste any time, do you?\c\nI think you’ll find it’s not so simple as all that.\nThere are a number of conditions you must meet\r\nif you hope to have your Pokémon Dynamax and\r\ntake on that gigantic form.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Now, don’t be afraid to go to all sorts of places\nand meet all sorts of Pokémon.\c\nThat will help fill out your Pokédex, too.[VAR 0114(000A)]

One last thing before we race, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nSee, I’ve got some great advice for you![VAR 0114(0005)]
You know how you sometimes see Pokémon\nwandering about out of the tall grass, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
If you move real slow like, and crouch down,\nthose Pokémon won’t pay you any notice.[VAR 0114(0005)]
But on the other hand...\c\nIf you whistle at them, you’ll be SURE to catch\ntheir attention![VAR 0114(0005)]
If you’re a bit rubbish at whistling, just remember\nthis: “Need a fail-proof trick? Press the Left Stick!”[VAR 0114(0005)]
Try it out, and let’s see who can catch the most\nPokémon, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
You remember Wedgehurst Station, right?\nWhere we went to pick up Lee before.\r\nThat’ll be the goal, so see you there![VAR 0114(0005)]
Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nYou’ll never beat me to the station at that pace![VAR 0114(0005)]
So, out with it, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nHow many did you catch?\c\nI caught a really special one![VAR 0114(0005)]
And you got...\c\nNot one?! What were you doing this whole time?\nYou’re going to want a team if you’re a Trainer![VAR 0114(0005)]
And you got yourself...\c\nOoh, just one! Looks like we’re at a draw.\nThough we are rivals and all, so that’s fair![VAR 0114(0005)]
But look at how many you caught!\nYou’re well on your way to building a fine team.[VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s a technical machine! A TM, mate!\c\nWith a TM like that, you can teach your Pokémon\na new move in a flash.\r\nAnd you can use them again and again, too.\c\nThat one can teach the move Swift.\nLee gave it to me ages ago, and now it’s yours.[VAR 0114(0005)]
The Gym Challenge will begin in Motostoke!\c\nAnd our train’s waiting, so let’s go![VAR 0114(0005)]

Not quite so fast, you two.[VAR 0114(0009)]
What’re you doing here, Mum?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I knew this day was coming since the moment\nyou chose [VAR 0101(0001)] as a partner, darling.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Professor Magnolia was kind enough to let us\nknow that you two were setting out.\c\nSo here—a last little gift to see you well set\non your way. All the kit you’ll need for camping![VAR 0114(0008)]
No matter what happens out there, if you and\nyour partner are together, I know you’ll be fine.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Thanks, Mum. And just think how lucky you are—\nmother to the first ever pair of Champion brothers!\c\nBecause I’m certain to be the Champion next.\nYou’ll see![VAR 0114(0005)]
Of course you will be, darling.\nAnyway, do have fun and take care of yourselves!\r\nYou’ll be welcome back home anytime![VAR 0114(0009)]
We’re off!
We’ll be fine!
Wish us luck! Not that we’ll need it.[VAR 0114(0005)]
There are loads of brilliant Trainers and all kinds\nof Pokémon out there waiting for us![VAR 0114(0005)]
My excitement’s running ahead of me even faster\nthan that train can go, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nCome on! We’re off![VAR 0114(0005)]
I imagine those two will be facing quite the\nsurprise when they arrive in Motostoke.[VAR 0114(0008)]
But who can blame them? A train journey does\nalways set the imagination on fire.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Boo ai!

Hey, Mr. Station Master!\nIsn’t this the Wild Area?\r\nWhat’re we stopped here for?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Yes...\nThis is the Wild Area Station, make no mistake.\c\nI’m sorry to tell you that the train is halted, due\nto a flock of Wooloo on the tracks.
What’s there to be sorry about?\nThis is brilliant![VAR 0114(0005)]
Brilliant?
What is?
This Wild Area is massive!\nThere are loads of Pokémon to battle here!\c\nYou get it, don’t you, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nThis is the best possible place to put together\r\nthe greatest team![VAR 0114(0005)]
We can get you back to Wedgehurst, if you like.\nBut Motostoke is off the menu for now.\c\nIt wouldn’t be very decent of us to try to drive\noff those Pokémon just because we happen to\r\nwant to run our train here, now would it?

That’s Motostoke, way off that way![VAR 0114(0005)]
And between there and here are countless new\nPokémon waiting to be met![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, hello.\nAnd if it isn’t Sonia.[VAR 0114(0005)]
My gran gave me a proper earful, in her\nown way...\c\n“Those two young Trainers are setting out on\na journey, but what are you doing with your life?”[VAR 0114(000B)]
That sounds rough
Ouch, Professor...
Ah... Never you mind that!\nNothing to worry yourselves over!\c\nBesides, I’d been quite curious about that\nPokémon you two met in the forest.\c\nI’d been thinking I should look into it, so\nthe timing works out fine![VAR 0114(000B)]
If I discover something really huge, then maybe\neven Gran’ll admit I’ve got some talent![VAR 0114(000B)]
Yikes...\nBeing an adult has got its own challenges, eh?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I said you needn’t worry about it!\c\nI’m glad to be on the road. Really! It’s been ages.\c\nIt’ll be great fun to fish and camp and\nrough it outside again.[VAR 0114(000B)]

Well, I’m off to go stick my head in as many of\nthose red glowing dens as I can find.\c\nI’m going to battle the snot out of a bunch of\nDynamax Pokémon and fill in another page\r\nin the tale of my legend![VAR 0114(0005)]
What cheek! Dynamax Pokémon are\nreally on another level, you know!\c\nYou’d better Dynamax your partner Pokémon,\ntoo, if you want to take on opponents that strong![VAR 0114(000B)]
You’ll find spots here and there in the Wild Area\nthat emit a red beam of light.\c\nIf you think you’re up to it, check them out.\nThere’ll be Dynamax Pokémon lurking inside!\c\nSo with that, how about I send you off with a\nlittle treat from me?[VAR 0114(000B)]
With a Pokémon Box Link, you’ll be able to\nput Pokémon from your team into your Boxes\r\nor take Pokémon from your Boxes to add them\r\nto your team. Nice, right?\c\nSo go wild catching as many Pokémon as you\nlike, and fill in some more of your Pokédex![VAR 0114(000B)]
The Wild Area is waiting for you!\nThis is the start of your real adventure![VAR 0114(000B)]

Real ace of you to make it through the\nWild Area!\c\nSeems like your trek ran your Pokémon ragged,\nthough. You should pop into the Pokémon Center.[VAR 0114(000B)]

So, brilliant young Trainer who’s braved the\nWild Area! Do you remember what your goal in\r\nMotostoke is?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m here for the Gym Challenge!
Uhhh...
Yup! The Gym Challenge opening ceremony.[VAR 0114(000B)]

By the way, the ceremony tomorrow is being held\nat the Motostoke Stadium, OK?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Use that lift over there to get to the\nstadium, ’K?[VAR 0114(000B)]

[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! All right?[VAR 0114(0004)]
One look tells me that you’ve become a Trainer\nworthy of that endorsement I gave you!\c\nAnd...yes, I reckon you might even be ready\nto use this...\c\nHere, try giving this to your partner to hold![VAR 0114(0004)]
You heading for Motostoke Stadium?[VAR 0114(0004)]
I am!
I’ve got other plans first
You can take that lift up to the city’s upper level,\nif you’re headed for the stadium next.[VAR 0114(0004)]
I guess you might want to have a look around\nthe city first. Only don’t get lost like I do!\c\nWhen you’re ready to visit the stadium, take\nthe lift to get up there![VAR 0114(0004)]

Let’s get signed up![VAR 0114(0005)]
If you’re here to register for the Gym Challenge,\nI’ll need to see your endorsement, please.
Fancy that... This is the first time we’ve had\na challenger endorsed by the Champion!
Well, now you’ve had two, because I am as well![VAR 0114(0005)]
What?! Two of you at once?!\nI wonder what’s come over Leon this year...\r\nThe two of you must be something special.
I’m Hop!\c\nI’m Leon’s little brother, in fact.\nAnd the next Champion.\c\nGet me all signed up, would you?[VAR 0114(0005)]
W-well, yes, I am trying to...\nIf you’ll just give me a moment...
There! You two have been successfully\nregistered as Gym Challengers.\c\nYou can now choose your preferred number\nfor your uniform, if you’d be so kind?\c\nIt will be displayed on the back of the uniform\nyou must wear for any official match.
Number [VAR 01C4(0001)], is it? Very well.\c\nAnd here. Please wear this Challenge Band at all\ntimes to identify yourself as a Gym Challenger.
The opening ceremony for the Gym Challenge\nis to be held here tomorrow.\c\nAll the Trainers taking part have been booked\na room at the nearby Budew Drop Inn.
That’s the League Chairman for you!\nEven booked us all hotel rooms!\c\nI’m off to check out the fancy digs![VAR 0114(0005)]
You’re lookin’ a bit gobsmacked by all this.\c\nYou must be from some small country town,\nis that it? I’m quite the same myself.[VAR 0114(0042)]
I was endorsed by the chairman himself.\c\nIn other words, among all those elite enough to\nget an endorsement, I’m the most elite of all.\c\nSo why don’t you clear off and not try talking to\nme again, would you?\c\nIt’s positively criminal of you, wasting the time\nof someone as important as I am.[VAR 0114(0042)]

If you’re looking for the Budew Drop Inn,\nyou’ll find it’s not far from the stadium.\c\nHead toward Route 3—it’s along the way.

Hiya! Looks like you both got\nyourselves registered.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh hey, Sonia! What’re you doing at our hotel?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m researching the mysterious Pokémon that\nare said to be in the Slumbering Weald.\c\nI reckon if I look into some of Galar’s legends, I\nmight figure something out. Care to join me?\r\nYou’re here already anyway.[VAR 0114(000B)]
What’s this, then?[VAR 0114(0005)]
It’s a statue of the hero who once saved the\nGalar region. I could run through the legend\r\nright quick, if you fancy?[VAR 0114(000B)]
The short version, if you please!
Give me all the details!
Long ago...a great black storm covered the\nGalar region. People called it “the Darkest Day.”\c\nThe land was assaulted by gigantic Pokémon...\nbut they were defeated by a single young hero\r\nbearing a sword and shield.\c\nThis statue here is meant to depict the young\nhero of that legend.[VAR 0114(000B)]
We still don’t understand what kind of sword and\nshield the hero actually had.\c\nAnd what this “black storm” is supposed to be\nis just another mystery...\c\nWhatever it was, it blotted out the skies all\nacross Galar. I suppose that tracks with it\r\nbeing called the Darkest Day, but still...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Huh... I suppose that hero must’ve been about as\nstrong as Lee, then!\c\nLooks like you’re going to have your hands full\nwith plenty to research, though, Sonia.\r\nBlack storms and swords and shields and all...[VAR 0114(0005)]
You’ll be all right, Sonia!
Will you be all right, Sonia?
Heh, thanks!\nI’ll muddle through somehow—don’t you worry![VAR 0114(000B)]
Course I will.\nI’ll muddle through somehow—don’t you worry![VAR 0114(000B)]
You two are staying here at the hotel tonight,\nthough, aren’t you? Shouldn’t you check in?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Probably so!\c\nAnd we’ll look out for you, too, Sonia. If we hear\nanything about any hero or whatnot, we’ll tell you![VAR 0114(0005)]
I guess we probably should head to the front\ndesk to get checked in.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Thanks for always taggin’ along with Hop.\nI hope you can keep it up.\c\nLeon really worries about him, too.\nHe practically raised him, after all.[VAR 0114(000B)]

They’re just so caught up with wantin’ to support\nme and all that they tend to get a bit shirty with\r\nother Gym Challengers.\c\nSorry if they caused you any trouble.[VAR 0114(000D)]

Wonderful!\c\nYou look sharp as a pin. And that [VAR 01C4(0001)] there...\nThat really is the number for you!

The chairman certainly seems to be in\nhigh spirits!\c\nNow, listen closely, you two. You’ve both only\njust started on your path as Trainers.\c\nIf you want to win, you need to do more than\njust train your Pokémon. You need to train\r\nyourselves, too.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Let’s do it, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nYou know the Gym Challenge has a set order that\r\nyou’ve gotta visit the Gyms in, right?\c\nThe first is in Turffield!\nAnd to get there, we need to head to Route 3![VAR 0114(0005)]

A gift...such a wonderful thing...\nFrom the chairman...such a wonderful man...
*ahem* Excuse me.\nThe gift is access to the Flying Taxis!
They allow you to, in a word, [VAR FF00(0001)]Fly[VAR FF00(0000)]!\c\nCalling a Flying Taxi will allow you to travel\nquickly back to areas you’ve already visited!
If it’s all right with you, I’ll read a segment from\nthe Flying Taxi user’s manual. *ahem*\c\n“Press the X Button and select the Town Map\noption to choose the place you’d like to go to.”
Anyway, your next goal should be Turffield—isn’t\nthat right, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nWhen traveling to a new place, it’s best to get\nthere on your own two legs, don’t you think?

Our Gym Challenge starts right now—from here\nin Motostoke!\c\nAlthough the first Gym Leader we’ll have to\nchallenge is in a town way far off from here...\c\nStill, you’d better believe I’m going to keep on\nwinning my way to that Championship Match![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hello, Galar! Meet your next Champion!\nFrom the sleepy town of Postwick—it’s me, Hop![VAR 0114(0005)]

Heya, Gym Challenger!\c\nYou looked real ace out there during\nthe opening ceremony![VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh, but where’s Hop?[VAR 0114(000B)]
He went on ahead
He went a different way
He can’t sit still at all, can he?\nGuess he really wants to catch up to his brother.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Well, you’re rivals, after all. I guess it makes\nsense you’d train on your own.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh, I know! Let me tell you about something a\nbit interesting.[VAR 0114(000B)]
You see that building over there?\nIt’s a company owned by Chairman Rose.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Just past Route 3, there’s a mine where they\ndig up ore. That building over there processes it\r\ninto energy.[VAR 0114(000B)]
In other words, the chairman is responsible for\nproviding the Galar region with its energy, too.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Can’t say I really get him, but the chairman\nseems like a pretty brilliant guy, right?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Here, a little something for having a chin-wag\nwith me! It’s an Escape Rope.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ll heal up your Pokémon, too![VAR 0114(000B)]
The way to Turffield is pretty long, but that’s a\nkind of challenge in its own right.\r\nGood luck, Gym Challenger![VAR 0114(000B)]

Coming this way?\nI’d advise against it.\c\nAny Trainer with a Wishing Star is in for a beating\nfrom me and my Pokémon![VAR 0114(0042)]
You.\c\nYou’re the Gym Challenger endorsed by\nthe Champion, aren’t you?[VAR 0114(0042)]
What a joke.\c\nYou are aware that the chairman is more\nimportant than the Champion, right?\c\nI was chosen by the chairman himself, so that\nmakes me more amazing than you![VAR 0114(0042)]
I suppose I should prove beyond doubt just how\npathetic you are and how strong I am.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Well, that was unexpected.\nI suppose you’re more able than I thought.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Naturally, I’ll remember your battle style and\nstrategies now.\c\nI’m sure to easily defeat you if and when\nwe face each other in an official match.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Now that we’ve established that, I won’t waste\nany more time on you.\c\nI’ve already gathered every Wishing Star in\nthis area.

Beeeeeeh!
Wooloo crashed into you and stopped!
My... Are you OK? You took that Tackle head on...
Hmmm? Oh, you must be one of those\nGym Challengers, right?
Yes, indeed!
No, I’m not
Ahhh, I thought so.\nI saw you at the opening ceremony.
Oh please, are you trying to have me on?\nI saw you at the opening ceremony!
My name’s Milo.\c\nI’m a Gym Leader and rather partial\nto Grass-type Pokémon.[VAR 0114(000E)]
I’ve been itching to see just how good the\nChampion-endorsed Gym Challengers are...\r\nLet me find out at the Gym Stadium!\c\nJust head on through this route, and you’ll run\nright into my stadium. See you there![VAR 0114(000E)]

Welcome, Gym Challenger!\nAllow me to help you through your registration.
First things first—how about a quick refresher\nabout the Gym Challenge?\c\nYour goal as a Gym Challenger is to complete\neach Gym mission, defeat every Gym Leader,\r\nand gather eight Gym Badges!
Got it!
Gym missions?
So, would you like to attempt the Gym mission?
Let’s do it!
One moment...
The [VAR FF00(0001)]Gym mission[VAR FF00(0000)] is a sort of test you need to\ngo through before facing the Gym Leader.\c\nEach Gym has a different mission for challengers.
If you would like to attempt the Gym mission,\nplease change into your uniform!
Then let the Gym mission begin!\nGive it your best shot!
You’re here for the Gym mission, right?\c\nOne of my favorite words is perseverance!
Congratulations! You’ve completed\nthe Gym mission!\c\nDon’t get too confident, though. Your teamwork\nwith your Pokémon is key when battling the\r\nGym Leader!
Oh, of course! Please come back anytime once\nyou’re ready to attempt the mission!

The mission given by Turffield’s Pokémon Gym\nis this!
To chase our unruly Wooloo!
To that blockade we’ve made from our bales of\nstraw over there!
Oh, by the way, you can call me Dan.\c\nI serve as a referee, and it’s also my job to report\nthe results of battles to the League HQ.
Now, let the Gym mission begin!
Did you need something?
What was the mission?
I want to withdraw
I’m good
Then on with you! And good luck!
Chase after the Wooloo, and gather them by\nthe blockade made of straw bales!\c\nIf you do, they’ll break through the blockade,\nand you’ll be able to carry on ahead.
If you withdraw, you’ll have to start over the next\ntime you give the mission a try. So, are you sure?
Then I look forward to your next attempt!
Congratulations on completing the Gym mission,\nChallenger [VAR 0100(0000)]!
Now you must face the Gym Leader, Milo,\nin a Pokémon battle!
I hope you’ll remember your battle with Milo\nevery time you look at that Grass Badge!
Gym mission start!
Gym mission cleared!
You’ve cleared the first blockade!
You’ve cleared the second blockade!\nTwo more to go—you’re halfway there!
Would you look at that! Defeating the Trainers\nseems to have settled that Yamper down, too!
Brilliant! You’ve made it through three blockades!\nJust one last obstacle remains!

My Gym’s the first one people face, so we get a\nlot of challengers.\c\nThat’s why I try to keep the Gym mission\nchallenging, but...[VAR 0114(000E)]
that didn’t stop you from completing\nit, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\r\nProper job![VAR 0114(000E)]
Sure seems like you understand Pokémon\nreal well.\c\nThis is gonna be a doozy of a battle!\nI’ll have to [VAR FF00(0001)]Dynamax[VAR FF00(0000)] my Pokémon\r\nif I want to win![VAR 0114(000E)]
That must have been a fulfilling Pokémon\nbattle for you![VAR 0114(000E)]
As proof that you have defeated a Gym Leader\nfor the Gym Challenge, allow me to present you\r\nwith your very own Grass Badge![VAR 0114(000E)]
You can now catch Pokémon of up to Lv. 25!
You need to obtain all eight Gym Badges in\norder to complete the Gym Challenge.\c\nAnd the only way to gather the Badges is to\ndefeat every Gym Leader![VAR 0114(000E)]
Do you want to go back to the reception area?
Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]! My most sincere\ncongratulations on defeating Gym Leader Milo!\c\nPlease accept this TM to commemorate\nyour victory.
Here, you can have Milo’s uniform to go with it!\nIt’s a replica, of course.
The Grass Badge looks good on you!\nKeep at it, Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]!

Thanks, Yamper![VAR 0114(000B)]
Bow wow wow!
I had you come ’cause I wanted to hear what\nyou thought.[VAR 0114(000B)]
So, that geoglyph...\nWhat do you think of it?[VAR 0114(000B)]
The Darkest Day?
Dynamax?
Right perceptive of you.\c\nEspecially since the portion depicting the black\nstorm has mostly disappeared.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Seems likely...\nIt certainly looks like a gigantic Pokémon.\c\nI suppose people three thousand years ago\ncould’ve just imagined this, but it looks too\r\nsimilar to Dynamax. It can’t just be coincidence.[VAR 0114(000B)]
A long time ago...a great black storm covered\nthe Galar region. Giant Pokémon ran rampant...\c\nBut what was that black storm they called\n“the Darkest Day”?\r\nWhat connection does it have to Dynamax?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Guess I’m the lucky lady who’ll be looking\ninto that... Gran sure gives me a lot to do.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Thanks for your thoughts on the matter!\nAs thanks, I’ll give you a League Card.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Milo’s a Grass-type Gym Leader. Things will go\nwell for you if you use Fire-, Flying-, or\r\nBug-type moves.\c\nTake these, too! It’d be pretty bad if your\nPokémon weren’t in fighting form![VAR 0114(000B)]
Go on, then! Get yourself to Turffield Stadium\nand battle yourself silly![VAR 0114(000B)]

Take a look at this, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
The Grass Gym Badge!\nI got it in one try![VAR 0114(0005)]
I reckon I’m just about the greatest when it\ncomes to wrangling Wooloo...\r\nI’ve had plenty of practice at it, after all![VAR 0114(0005)]
But I’m sure you can win this one, too.\nAfter all, you are my rival![VAR 0114(0005)]

Text File : main_event_0616
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some advice for you, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nThe Gym Challenge has a set order you’ll need\r\nto follow.[VAR 0114(000E)]
So that means your next stop should be in\nHulbury to meet Nessa. Hulbury’s just beyond\r\nRoute 5.\c\nOr since you’ve got the Grass Badge, you could\nhead to the Wild Area.\c\nIt’s a bit tricky to catch Pokémon that are a\nhigher level than the Pokémon on your team, but\r\nthey make powerful allies if you succeed![VAR 0114(000E)]

Oi! Just hand over that bike already!\nWe need it to cross this long bridge![VAR 0114(006F)]
We’re gonna use that bike to chase around\nGym Challengers! It’ll be a scream![VAR 0114(006F)]
How barbaric!\c\nIt wouldn’t work anyway. You don’t even have a\nRotom with you!
Hey, young Gym Challenger!\nThey’re trying to steal my bike!\c\nPlease, if you could give them a good thrashing,\nI would be in your debt!
Oi, we’re not tryin’ to steal the bike!\nOnly borrow it!\c\nWe’re gonna use it to chase after\nGym Challengers and make ’em all tired!\c\nBut I’m thinkin’ you deserve a special shout-out.\nI’m gonna crush you in a battle![VAR 0114(006F)]
Gah...\nYou crushed my attempt to crush you.[VAR 0114(006F)]
Why you... I want that bike!\nDon’t get in my way![VAR 0114(006F)]
You’re too strong! If you stay in the Gym\nChallenge, you’re gonna cause problems for\r\nour lady!\c\nYou ’aven’t seen the last of us! We’re gonna\nmake sure you stay out of our lady’s way![VAR 0114(006F)]
My word, you’re quite the Trainer!\c\nAnd I see you have a Pokédex, too!\nThat means you have a Rotom with you!\c\nFantastic! I think I’ll give this bike to you, then.\nBetter you have it than Team Yell!
Now, you know that Rotom love motors\nvery, very much, right?\c\nEnough to jump right into machines that\nhave motors!\c\nSo, that got me thinking... If I attached a motor\nto a bicycle, then maybe I could get a Rotom to\r\npop into that as well!
Right...
I see
Come now—give it a shot!\c\nEnjoy cycling together with Rotom to the fullest.
Chop, chop, come on now!\c\nYou and Rotom ride that bicycle together!

I warned you! We’re both Gym Challengers\nwho’ve earned ourselves a Grass Badge.\r\nThis is the perfect training![VAR 0114(0005)]
You’ve gotten strong, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nSeems I’ve got to train even harder from now on.[VAR 0114(0005)]

Fans are very important, of course.\nThat’s why you need to keep doing your work—\r\nfor their sake.[VAR 0114(0007)]

That’s right! Bede! I daresay I’m impressed how\nfar you’ve come since I gave you that Pokémon\r\nall those years ago.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Will you be the one to win the Gym Challenge?\nOr perhaps it will be one of the Trainers\r\nendorsed by the Champion.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I will prove your faith in me was well placed,\nChairman. I won’t lose to anyone!\c\nAnyway, I will be on my way now.[VAR 0114(000C)]

You’re going to face Gym Leader Nessa\nsoon, yes?\c\nIf you get a Gym Badge from her, I’ll hold a\ncelebration. I’d like to get to know you a\r\nlittle better, after all![VAR 0114(0006)]

Continue to seize victories in the Gym Challenge\nwith your Pokémon.\c\nYou have an incredible spirit that may even be\nstrong enough to challenge the Champion.[VAR 0114(000F)]
You and your Pokémon are indeed deserving of\nthis Gym Badge.[VAR 0114(000F)]

Hulbury is a seafood town.\c\nNaturally, if one is going to eat here, the\nobvious choice is the local cuisine!\r\nEverything on the menu is delicious.[VAR 0114(0006)]
By the way, how is Professor Magnolia getting on?[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m quite indebted to her, you know.\c\nShe was the one who figured out how to unleash\nthe power of Wishing Stars and use that power\r\nto Dynamax Pokémon. We would never have\r\nbeen able to create Dynamax Bands without her.[VAR 0114(0006)]
*sigh*\c\nShe was saying that there’s still so much\nwe don’t know about Dynamaxing.\r\nIt’s causing her some worry.[VAR 0114(000B)]
She even made me take a Power Spot Detector\nwith me when I started traveling...[VAR 0114(000B)]
A Power Spot Detector! That’s the device that\nallowed me to discover the Power Spots...\c\nLocations that emit Galar particles and allow\nPokémon to Dynamax![VAR 0114(0006)]
I don’t like hearing that Professor Magnolia is so\nworried, though. If only there were something\r\nI could do...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Sonia, it may be good for you to visit the vault\nin Hammerlocke.\c\nI believe the key to unlocking the secrets of\nthe Dynamax phenomenon lies in the history\r\npreserved there.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Understood, Chairman. I will arrange a meeting\nwith Ms. Sonia.[VAR 0114(0007)]

You again...[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’d feel sorry for my Pokémon if I made them\ntake part in a battle against low-level opponents.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m not in the mood to deal with weaklings\nright now.\c\nThen again, I suppose it’s a form of mercy to\ncrush weak opponents early on.[VAR 0114(000C)]
If you’re under the misguided impression that\nyou’re stronger than me, then surely you would\r\nbe up for a Pokémon battle.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Naturally!
Hold on a minute...
It’s utterly inconceivable that I, the challenger\nchosen by the chairman, will lose![VAR 0114(000C)]
Hmph!\nI’ve no time to deal with pathetic Trainers![VAR 0114(000C)]
Ah, pardon me. It seems I must take back\nmy words.\c\nYou’re not weak—you just lack talent.\nYour chances of completing the Gym Challenge\r\nare pretty slim, I must say. Here, I’ll give you this.\r\nSomething to show you at least tried.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Now, where shall I go next to collect\nWishing Stars?[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m just gonna keep my mouth shut...\c\nOtherwise, his Pokémon will just knock me down\nagain... Nah, not doin’ that...[VAR 0114(0043)]
I’m havin’ me a lovely little dream...\nA dream where I actually won the battle...[VAR 0114(0044)]

’Scuse me, mate, sorry to bother you...\c\nYou’re one of them takin’ part in the\nGym Challenge, right?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Crikey, but that’s really somethin’!\nI’d love a battle against a great Trainer like you.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Well, look at you, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Surrounded by adoring fans, eh?\nYou’ll even be showing up Lee pretty soon![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oi, jog on, mate!\nCan’t you see we’re in the middle of a\r\nconversation here?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Yeah?\nAnd can’t you see that I’m Hop, the Trainer\r\nwho’ll be your next Champion?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oooh, so we’ve got a joker here, eh?\nYou’re so funny, I forgot to laugh.[VAR 0114(0044)]
You think I’m joking? I’ll prove it, then!\c\nAnd I think a battle with you lot would definitely\nend with some laughs![VAR 0114(0005)]
Let’s take ’em on together, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nYou ready, mate?[VAR 0114(0005)]
The two of us were endorsed by the\nChampion himself!\c\nWe’ll show you just what that means![VAR 0114(0005)]
Got it!\nThen get yourself all ready for a good battle![VAR 0114(0005)]
Well, if you insist... Team Yell’s gonna teach you\nkids that the Gym Challenge’s no joke!\r\nYou better not be yell-ow![VAR 0114(0043)]
What’d this other kid have to come waltzin’ up\nfor, eh? I just wanted to knock off challengers\r\none at a time...[VAR 0114(0044)]
Nice one, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nThat’s my rival for you![VAR 0114(0005)]
Now then...\nWhere could Kabu have gone off to?\r\nLet’s keep going. Maybe he’s farther in![VAR 0114(0005)]
That little mug’s the Champion’s little brother...\c\nGuess that’s what you get when your older\nbrother’s not useless...[VAR 0114(0043)]
I know we’re Team Yell, but we’ll leave quietly\nonce we’re beaten...[VAR 0114(0044)]

Look at you, little chap! Who’s a rugged, rocky\nlittle love?\c\nYou are, Carkol. You’re my little rubble-wubble![VAR 0114(0043)]
Gor?
Oi, can’t you see me spendin’ some quality time\nhere with my beloved Carkol?\c\nYou’re not tryin’ to disturb us, are you? If you are,\nI’ll just have to make it clear you’re not welcome![VAR 0114(0043)]
I was the strongest one in Galar Mine No. 2, but\nnow my spot’s been taken...[VAR 0114(0043)]
What’s your problem, eh?\c\nHere we had the brilliant idea to block the path\nwhile passin’ the time showin’ Carkol a\r\nbit of love, and then you come along![VAR 0114(0044)]
Retreat! That’s it, lads!\nLeave the Pokémon behind and leg it![VAR 0114(005E)]
Cleared them right off, eh, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Wait, have I got this straight?\c\nThose fanatics were only in our way...so they\ncould spend a bit of time playing with Carkol?![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hmph.\c\nIt seems I made the right decision, letting the\nrabble deal with the rabble.\c\nThe only thing weak Trainers like yourselves are\ngood for is clearing my path.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m sorry you had to deal with that, Carkol.\nWere you in the middle of a Poké Job, then?\c\nGo on! Break those rocks, and hurry back safe to\nyour Trainer![VAR 0114(000C)]
Goooooor!
Actually...\c\nYou two aren’t even all that useful in clearing\nmy path, compared to that Pokémon.\c\nStill, I suppose you did take care of Team Yell.\nHere’s something for your trouble.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Rrrgh! That little—![VAR 0114(0005)]
Do you suppose that Carkol found its way\nback to its Trainer all right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Still, I wonder...\nWhere has Kabu wandered off to?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Thank you for helping out with my training,\nTeam Yell! But I must say...\c\nit’s unforgivable for you to get in the way of a\nCarkol hard at work![VAR 0114(0010)]
We weren’t gettin’ in its way!\nWe were tryin’ to cheer it on![VAR 0114(0043)]
Still, you did a number on us in that Pokémon\nbattle, so...it’s time for Team Yell to scarper\r\nand give a morale boost elsewhere![VAR 0114(0044)]
Goooooor!
Cheering is one thing, but one shouldn’t get in\nthe way of honest work![VAR 0114(0010)]
That’s Kabu... Man, he’s wicked!\nNo wonder he’s the Fire-type Gym Leader![VAR 0114(0005)]
Ah, you are the Trainers endorsed by Leon!\nHop and [VAR 0100(0000)], am I right?\c\nI’m just training right up until the last moment so\nthat I can guarantee the perfect match when I\r\nface you Gym Challengers![VAR 0114(0010)]
I specialize in Fire-type Pokémon, and the\nWater-type Pokémon in Galar Mine No. 2 are\r\nthe perfect opponents to train against![VAR 0114(0010)]
Regardless, it’s getting late.\c\nJust go straight once you get out of this mine,\nand you’ll reach Motostoke.\c\nGet a good rest at the hotel, and make sure\nyou’re both in your top condition![VAR 0114(0010)]
Come on, Carkol. Time for you to head on home,\ntoo. I’ll make sure you get there safely.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Gooor!
We’re going to be on fire tomorrow![VAR 0114(0010)]
I remember Lee talking about Kabu.\c\nHe said that a lot of Gym Challengers give up\nbecause they just can’t beat Kabu.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Man, now I’m getting all fired up, too![VAR 0114(0005)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_0740

That Carkol from before...\c\nI guess it must’ve been here on a job.\nYou do know about Poké Jobs by now, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I do
Poké what?
Course you do![VAR 0114(0005)]
Looks like there’s no helping it, in that case...\c\nSettle down and let Professor Hop teach you a\nthing or two!\c\nLet’s see if I can remember what Lee had written\ndown in his old notebooks...\c\nBasically, you can have your Pokémon go about\nand help companies or other folks who are in\r\nneed of something.\c\nYou can take Poké Jobs from the Rotomi at any\nPokémon Center, so give it a look sometime.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Now, I’m cream-crackered!\nI’m for the Budew Drop Inn and some sleep.\c\nCome tomorrow, that Fire Gym Leader Kabu\nbetter be ready, because I’ll be coming for him![VAR 0114(0005)]
Burning the midnight oil, are we?\c\nIf you’re here for the Gym Challenge, you won’t\nbe able to challenge Kabu till the morning.
For now, it’d be best to simply get yourself a\ngood night’s rest at the Budew Drop Inn!

I’m doin’ some visualization trainin’.\c\nMy battle with Kabu’s tomorrow. So, I\nthought if I came here and had a look at\r\nthe stadium, I’d get some ideas for a strategy.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Just ’cause you were chosen by the Champion,\ndoesn’t mean I’m gonna lose to you!\c\nIn fact, I’ll keep winnin’, and I’ll have a proper\ngo at the Champion, got it?[VAR 0114(000D)]

That friend of yours already went off to\nchallenge the next Gym.\c\nKabu’s League Card is supposed to help\nagainst him, but I ended up with a few copies,\r\nso I’ll give you one.\c\nDon’t look so chuffed. It’s no big deal.[VAR 0114(000D)]

Take this, too... A little somethin’ for our\nbattle yesterday.[VAR 0114(000D)]

A Gym Challenger!\c\nAh, but if you want to battle our Leader Kabu,\nyou’ll need to have earned a Grass Badge in\r\nTurffield and a Water Badge in Hulbury first!
A Gym Challenger!\nAnd you’ve even earned your first two Badges!\c\nBut I’m afraid our Leader Kabu has gone off to\nGalar Mine No. 2 to undergo some special\r\ntraining with his team.\c\nYou might want to head to Hulbury and try to\ncatch him in the mines on the way back here.
Hey, a Gym Challenger!\nThat’s a welcome sight!\c\nWe don’t have too many challengers, since our\nLeader Kabu has made his Gym mission so hard...\r\nBut I’ll be happy to get you registered at once!
I’m ready!
Not yet
Roger that! I’ll be here, so come back when\nyou’re ready to challenge our Gym!
If you’re here to challenge our Gym, we’ll ask\nyou to change into your uniform first...
Congratulations on clearing the Gym mission!\nYou had that one in the bag, eh?\c\nNext up will be your match against Leader Kabu.\nI wonder which one of you will burn brighter?
You may find the Fire Gym’s mission a bit\ndifferent than others you’ve faced. In you go!
Please take this TM to commemorate what\nyou accomplished here today!
And take one of our uniforms.\nIt’s the same design as Kabu himself wears.
Few enough people challenge Leader Kabu,\nand even fewer manage to defeat him...\c\nIt’ll be a treat to see how such a promising\nTrainer does in the Gym Challenge!
Back for our Gym mission, are you?\nGood luck racking up those points!
[~ 13]
Heya, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nI was on fire in my battle against that Kabu![VAR 0114(0005)]

The Gym mission for the Fire Gym is this!\c\nCatching Pokémon to earn the most points!
Earn five points to clear the Gym mission!\c\nIn case you were wondering, you’ll earn one\npoint for defeating a Pokémon in the tall grass\r\nor two points for catching a Pokémon.\c\nBut you won’t be alone in this competition.\nOther Trainers will be joining you in your battles!
Think about what your opponents might do,\nand try to take the best action to rack up points!
Now, let the Gym mission begin!
Did you need something?
What was the mission?
I want to withdraw
I’m good
Get five points to clear the mission!\c\nDefeating a Pokémon in the tall grass gets you\none point, but catching a Pokémon gets you two!
If you withdraw, you’ll have to start over the next\ntime you give the mission a try. So, are you sure?
Then I look forward to your next attempt!
Well done!\nThat’s the way to clear a Gym mission!
Next you’ll be facing Kabu, the leader of the\nFire Gym! On you go, Challenger!
Right you are!\nThen on you go, Challenger!
A cautious one, are you?\nGet yourself all sorted first, in that case.
Then on with you! And good luck!
Gym mission start!
Gym mission completed!
Clearing Leader Kabu’s Gym mission like that...\nYou’re positively on fire!
Congratulations on another mission cleared!
[~ 20]
Now [VAR 0200(0001)] more point[VAR 1101(0001,0100)]s needed to clear the\nFire Gym mission!\nKeep that fire burning! (Gym Leader Kabu)

[~ 32]
Oh my word, is Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]\nreally going to end this thing with naught?![VAR 0114(0018)]
Your target is the wild Pokémon!\nDon’t concern yourself with the other Trainers!
The other Gym Trainers are all stronger than me!\nBe careful out there!
Status conditions are the greatest!\nGetting burned will land you in real hot water!
A Full Heal can cure any sort of status condition!
Study the situation, and choose your opponent\nwisely based on it!
We won’t let you get through the Fire Gym’s\nmission that easily!

Welcome! I am Kabu, the Fire-type Gym Leader.\c\nThe fact that you are here means you’ve bested\nboth Milo’s Grass-type Pokémon and Nessa’s\r\nWater types, too.\c\nThat’s quite an accomplishment![VAR 0114(0010)]
Every Trainer and Pokémon trains hard in pursuit\nof victory.\c\nBut that means your opponent is also working\nhard to win.\c\nIn the end, the match is decided by which side is\nable to unleash their true potential.[VAR 0114(0010)]
I’m often regarded as the first real roadblock\nof the Gym Challenge, and yet you defeated me!\c\nClearly, your talent surpassed my many years\nof experience.\c\nI still have much to learn![VAR 0114(0010)]
I know now that you and your Pokémon will\nbecome a fantastic team.\r\nI’m glad I could battle you today![VAR 0114(0010)]
Let me give you a Fire Badge as proof that\nyou’ve defeated me![VAR 0114(0010)]
You can now catch Pokémon of up to Lv. 35!
Thanks to the Dynamax phenomenon, our\nPokémon battles have become part of the\r\nGalar region’s culture.[VAR 0114(0010)]
And it’s the young Trainers who are responsible\nfor keeping our culture alive.\c\nOf course, I hope that instead of just keeping it\nalive, you also help it become something better.\r\nWe adults will be the pillars for you to build on.[VAR 0114(0010)]

Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nI see you’ve done a fine job collecting the Gym\nBadges from the Grass, Water, and Fire Gyms.
I think you’ve proven your skill well enough to\ntry your hand against the Gyms that await you,\r\nstarting in the city of Hammerlocke.
Head back down into the Wild Area surrounding\nthis city, then make your way to Hammerlocke!
With all the Badges we’ve earned ourselves,\nI reckon we should be all right even against the\r\nfierce Pokémon you find deep in the Wild Area.\c\nLet’s go find out for ourselves![VAR 0114(0005)]

You’re the Gym Leader, but you still came all the\nway to see us off?\c\nOh, I bet you can already tell that I’m the one\nwho’ll become the next Champion, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
There are many Trainers who never manage\nto gather three Gym Badges, and they just\r\ngive up on the Gym Challenge altogether...\c\nSo I make a point to see off any Trainers who\nare able to defeat me.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Whew, we made it...\nThank goodness for Flying Taxis![VAR 0114(000F)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], Hop, congratulations!\nIt’s pretty amazing you two defeated Kabu![VAR 0114(000F)]
Not a lot of Gym Challengers are able to get a\nGym Badge from Kabu.\c\nWe like to get together to see them off, as a way\nof showing our support.[VAR 0114(000E)]
So, allow me to send you off with a\nproper, sporty chant![VAR 0114(0010)]
Hustle, hustle, hustle, Hop!\nYou can do it, you can do it, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0010)]
The Gym Leaders you will face ahead are all\ntough opponents.\c\nBut I believe that you will prevail!\nBelieve in your Pokémon and keep pushing on![VAR 0114(0010)]
Thanks, you all!\c\nWe’re gonna keep winning! We’ve got to if we\nwant a face-off in the Champion Cup, after all![VAR 0114(0005)]
Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nLet’s head for Hammerlocke![VAR 0114(0005)]
Look into yourself for things you lack.\c\nThose who understand their own weaknesses\nlearn and grow the most![VAR 0114(0010)]
You run into a lot of unexpected things\nwhen you work as a farmer.\c\nSame thing with Pokémon battles. Just don’t\ngive up and things will work out.[VAR 0114(000E)]
There’s nothing wrong with stoically facing\nchallenges, but push yourselves too hard, and\r\nyou’ll pop.\c\nIf you ever feel maxed out, come up for a\nbreather at the seafood restaurant.[VAR 0114(000F)]

Mr. Chairman!\c\nI’ve been collecting both Wishing Stars and\nGym Badges as fast as I can![VAR 0114(000C)]
Good work, Bede.\c\nI’m glad you haven’t forgotten that it was the\nchairman who endorsed you.[VAR 0114(0007)]
If I gather enough Wishing Stars, that’ll help\nsolve the problem that’s been bothering you,\r\nright, Mr. Chairman?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Oh, it’s not just about me.\nIt’s for the future of the whole Galar region.[VAR 0114(0006)]
And we’ll need more than just Wishing Stars.\nWe need a powerful Pokémon Trainer, too—\r\nsomeone like the Champion.[VAR 0114(0006)]
With all due respect, sir, I was able to show\nHop, one of the Champion-endorsed Trainers,\r\njust how outclassed he was.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m sure I’ll be able to defeat the Champion.\nNo, I WILL defeat the Champion![VAR 0114(000C)]
That’s the spirit! It takes healthy competition\nto really keep the Gym Challenge energized![VAR 0114(0006)]
Challenger Bede, there is something I wish\nto discuss with you.\r\nDo you have a moment?[VAR 0114(0007)]
I hope you were listening, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0006)]
As you know, Wishing Stars are those mysterious\nstones that are even attached to your\r\nDynamax Bands.[VAR 0114(0006)]
There’s more to Wishing Stars than just making\nyour Pokémon into giants, though!\c\nThey hold far more energy than that![VAR 0114(0006)]
If you’re curious, you should head to the stadium.\nIn fact, we should head inside right away!\r\nI’ll even give you a little lesson on how the Galar\r\nregion gets its energy![VAR 0114(0006)]

Hammerlocke’s stadium doubles as an\nEnergy Plant.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Now, have a look at my tablet.\nI’ve got all the information you need on it.[VAR 0114(0006)]
See? An easy-to-understand description of\nthe Energy Plant!
First, energy is absorbed from Hammerlocke\nStadium’s tower...
Then, it’s changed into electricity in the\nunderground power plant and delivered to\r\npeople throughout the region!
Our lives and society require various types of\nenergy sources, such as electricity, natural gas,\r\nand water.[VAR 0114(0006)]
My associate groups aim to improve everyone’s\nlives by harnessing the power stored in\r\nWishing Stars![VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh! It’s time for me to get to work.\nI should get a move on before Oleana decides to\r\ngive me another earful.[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], I suggest you head over to the\nvault next.\c\nJust head toward Route 6 from the stadium, and\nyou should find the vault without any issues![VAR 0114(0006)]

[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]!\nSeems you’re doing well collecting Gym Badges.[VAR 0114(0004)]
But Hop...\c\nDid something happen with him?\nHe was acting really odd when I ran into him.\c\nHe took one look at me and immediately was\nlike, “I’m so sorry, Lee!”\c\nIt might be the first time I’ve heard him apologize\nfor anything, and I’ve no idea what it was for![VAR 0114(0004)]
Maybe he’s feeling down because he’s had some\nhard losses in battle?[VAR 0114(0004)]
He lost to that Challenger Bede
I think so
When you lose, you feel down in the dumps.\c\nBut then there’s nowhere left to go but back up!\nYou’ve got to think on why it was you lost, though.\c\nYou know, that little brother of mine...I think he\nmight yet become a surprisingly great Trainer![VAR 0114(0004)]
At least I’ve got you to keep an eye on him.\nYou will look out for Hop, won’t you? As his rival.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Blast, and look at the time!\c\nNearly forgot my meeting with the chairman.\nThat Oleana really lets me hear it when I’m late!\c\nNow if only I could remember which way to go...[VAR 0114(0004)]
Anyway, I’d say that you should go and say hello\nto Raihan while you’re here, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nHe’s the greatest rival I’ve got and the final\nhurdle you’ll have to face in the Gym Challenge.\c\nHe should still be around the vault, if you hurry.\nIt’s down that way—on the way to Route 6.[VAR 0114(0004)]

Oh!\nIf it isn’t the Trainer endorsed by the Champion!\c\nLet’s see... What was your name again?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Ah, right! [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0017)]
And if Leon himself recognized your potential...\nthen I guess you’ll grow into quite the Trainer.\c\nAll the same, though, anyone wanting to\nchallenge the mighty Raihan has to prove they’re\r\nup to it by earning seven Gym Badges first.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I already knew that
I’m here to visit the vault
Ah, so you’re here to see our treasures,\nare you?\c\nGaining a better understanding of Pokémon by\nstudying history certainly isn’t a bad idea.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I like your spirit, kid!\nFollow me, why don’t you.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I’ll even spare you one of my League Cards.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Now on you go!\nIf it’s the vault you want, it’s up those stairs there.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Weren’t you here to see the vault?\nThat girl’s up there, too. You know.\r\nMiss Clever Clogs.[VAR 0114(0017)]
If you want your chance to battle the great\nRaihan for yourself, collect those Gym Badges!\c\nYou’ll need seven of them—and the next is\nwaiting for you in Stow-on-Side, down Route 6.[VAR 0114(0017)]

Oh, you’re here.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Brilliant, aren’t they? It’s great that there are still\ntreasured tapestries that can tell us of\r\nGalar’s history.[VAR 0114(000B)]
The two youths watching a Wishing Star.[VAR 0114(000B)]
A disaster occurs...\nThe two bewildered youths.[VAR 0114(000B)]
The youths looking on at the sword and shield\nthat stop the disaster.[VAR 0114(000B)]
The youths being crowned.[VAR 0114(000B)]
These tapestries tell the story of the\ncreation of a kingdom in Galar.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Say, young Gym Challenger, what sticks out to\nyou most about them?[VAR 0114(000B)]
There’s two heroes?
The Darkest Day?
Bang on! The statue at that hotel in\nMotostoke only had one hero, no matter how\r\nyou slice it. But here, we clearly have two youths.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Right? That’s got to be it.\c\nThe story of the black storm that blotted out the\nskies was passed on through the years as a tale\r\nof disaster... That’s what the Darkest Day is![VAR 0114(000B)]
Was there really only one hero, or were there\ntwo? And what even caused the Darkest Day?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Thanks for letting me bounce some ideas off you.\nI think I’ve got some theories now.\c\nI’m going to research the tapestries a tad more,\nbut you have your Gym Challenge, right?\c\nI’m cheering for you, so take a couple of these.\nI hope to see more of your wins![VAR 0114(000B)]
Whatever happened to the sword and shield that\ndrove off the disaster?[VAR 0114(000B)]

The tapestries in the vault depict the heroes of\nthe Galar region’s past.\c\nI suppose if we’ve got any modern hero, it’d have\nto be our Champion, Leon.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Listen up, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nYour goal is to defeat that superstar Leon.\nSo go conquer Route 6 and train yourself up\r\nalong the way to Stow-on-Side![VAR 0114(0017)]

What a cute Silicobra.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Just look at those adorable eyes.[VAR 0114(0044)]
It’s our duty as Team Yell to make sure Silicobra\ngets a nice, peaceful sleep![VAR 0114(0043)]
Hello there. If I promise not to wake the\nPokémon, will you let me through?
Of course! It’d be our pleasure.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Oh, hey, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nYou’re heading to Stow-on-Side, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oi, Team Yell. Don’t suppose\nyou’ll let us through?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Nah, you kids are way too loud.\nCan’t be lettin’ you through.\c\nAn’ we’re particularly not fond of kids wearin’\nthe Challenge Band![VAR 0114(0043)]
With all your stompin’ around, Silicobra is sure to\nwake up![VAR 0114(0044)]
Right...[VAR 0114(0005)]
What do you say, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nIf we don’t get past them, we won’t be able to\ncontinue our Gym Challenge at Stow-on-Side...[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll battle them!
Let me think...
You...\nYeah, that’s the spirit![VAR 0114(0005)]
I don’t figure thinking at them is going to change\nmuch about the situation. What else you got?[VAR 0114(0005)]
You two are way too noisy. You don’t wanna\nwake up Silicobra, now do you?[VAR 0114(0044)]
I swear, kids these days... Well, we’ve got no\nchoice. We have to send you packin’.\r\nIt’s all for the sake of Silicobra![VAR 0114(0043)]
Think I’ll leave this to you, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nKeep up the pace.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Silicobra might wake up after all that ruckus![VAR 0114(0044)]
Then there’s no point in us stickin’ around!\nLet’s get out of here! We’ll make these bothersome\r\nkids holler some other day![VAR 0114(0043)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]...\nYou and [VAR 0101(0001)] were brilliant together![VAR 0114(0005)]
See, Bede really wiped the floor with me the\nlast time we battled...\c\nAnd don’t get me wrong—I can take a loss!\nBattling means you’ve got to lose sometimes.[VAR 0114(0005)]
But he said that I was dragging Lee’s good name\nthrough the mud, being so rubbish like I was...\c\nAnd I just can’t get those words out of my head![VAR 0114(0005)]
If I’m weak, then people’ll think Lee’s weak, too...\c\nBut I don’t want that! I can’t let Lee get dragged\ndown! He’s the unbeatable Champion!\c\nI’m gonna have to take some time figuring this\nout. See you around, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0005)]

But the only thing I can do is get stronger, right?\c\nSo I’m gonna try out all kinds of different things\nagainst you and see what works![VAR 0114(0005)]
You’re on!
Wait a second...
Then let’s do this! I bet an all-out battle with my\ntrue rival will help me get my head on straight![VAR 0114(0005)]
What? Your rival is depressed over here, and you\nwon’t lift a finger to help?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hrmmm...\c\nI tried switching my team members in and out to\nmax out their potential in every matchup, but...\c\nWe just couldn’t get it together somehow...\nMaybe that’s why I’m still so weak...[VAR 0114(0005)]
But Lee really is the greatest Trainer!\c\nAnd I don’t want people to be laughing at him\nall because his little brother is rubbish![VAR 0114(0005)]
It’s not enough! I’ve got to try harder!\nAnd harder and harder till no one’s laughing!\c\nI’m off, mate! Off to find the kind of Pokémon\nthat I can really draw the strength out of![VAR 0114(0005)]

But not good, either.\c\nAnd I think I know why.\nYou need more pink.\c\nHere, have a look at this League Card.\nMaybe it’ll inspire you to add a little more pink.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I plan on putting you both to the test soon, so\nyou better not slack off on your training![VAR 0114(0013)]
That child...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Gym Challengers should battle for the sake of\ntheir own Pokémon.\c\nWhy worry about saving the Champion’s name?\nWe all know he’s unbeatable.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Anyway, here’s something for letting me watch\nyour battle.[VAR 0114(0013)]

I’m good
Use the control stick to spin your cup, and\nmake your way to the goal!
If you withdraw, you’ll have to start over the next\ntime you give the mission a try. So, are you sure?

I was the one chosen by the chairman...\nI was the one who was to defeat the Champion...\c\nI’m one of the elite—someone who can shoulder\nthe future of the Galar region![VAR 0114(000C)]
Challenger Bede![VAR 0114(0007)]
I wondered what you were up to when you asked\nto borrow Chairman Rose’s Copperajah...\c\nI can’t believe you’d try to use the chairman’s\nPokémon to destroy a historical site![VAR 0114(0007)]
Who cares for some ancient ruin when the next\nthousand years are at stake?!\c\nDid you stand in the path of a Pokémon’s\nSimple Beam or something? How do you expect\r\nto support the chairman with that sort\r\nof thinking?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Young Bede...[VAR 0114(0006)]
It pains me to have to say this, but...\nI am truly disappointed.\c\nIt’s true that I am the one who found you,\nback when you were all alone...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I saw talent in you. You reminded me a little bit\nof myself, back when I was young.\c\nThat’s why I sent you to a Trainers’ school, to\ngive you a chance at success.[VAR 0114(0006)]
But trying to destroy the mural—part of Galar’s\nhistory! You show no love toward Galar!\c\nYou are clearly not a worthy challenger for the\nGym Challenge.[VAR 0114(0006)]
We will decide what to do with you later.\nFor now, you will return to Hammerlocke.[VAR 0114(0006)]
You...you must be joking, right?\c\nYou’re disqualifying me from the Gym Challenge?\nBut you’re the one who endorsed me!\c\nThere are a hundred different ways we could\nsort this out... Why are you choosing the worst\r\npossible option?![VAR 0114(000C)]
Challenger Bede. I will be taking those\nWishing Stars that you have gathered.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Ah, Sonia! And [VAR 0100(0000)], too.\nTerrible shame, all this. An absolute disaster.\c\nI never wish to see us lose challengers for this\nsort of reason.\c\nYet we do what we must do to keep things\nfair and sportsmanlike.[VAR 0114(0006)]
You know, during one of Bede’s matches, I heard\nthe announcer say that Bede has no family.\c\nApparently it was Rose who took Bede under\nhis wing, and so Bede was battling for the\r\nchairman’s sake.[VAR 0114(000B)]

Not a brilliant turn of events, but the ruins were\nbrought into the light for us to see...[VAR 0114(000B)]
What does this tell us about Galar’s legends?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Pokémon?
A sword and shield?
Right! More than any hero, there’s those things\nthat appear to be Pokémon that stand out!\c\nNot just that, but those Pokémon appear to be\nholding a sword and shield as if they were\r\nusing them![VAR 0114(000B)]
Anything else look interesting to you?[VAR 0114(000B)]
The hero...was actually two people?
The same as the tapestries?
Oh, good observation!\c\nThere really were two heroes. But if that’s the\ncase, then why only the one statue at the\r\nBudew Drop Inn?[VAR 0114(000B)]
More than any statue of a hero or old tapestry,\nthese ruins made in truly ancient times must show\r\nus the real truth.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Which means...[VAR 0114(000B)]
The sword is a Pokémon!
The shield is a Pokémon!
Yup! I was thinking the same thing!\c\nSeems like at some point in history the sword and\nshield were combined with the two actual\r\nPokémon and treated as the same thing...\c\nBut then what? They just faded from history?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Two young heroes... The sword and shield were\nactually Pokémon... But why would the truth of\r\nthese ruins be hidden when their stories were\r\ndepicted in artwork?[VAR 0114(000B)]
With your help, I really feel like we made a big\ndiscovery here. Thanks! I’ll give you a couple of\r\nthese, so you keep giving it your best in the\r\nGym Challenge, too, OK?\c\nGuess you’ll be headed to Ballonlea next, right?[VAR 0114(000B)]
So... There was history being covered up by all\nthat over-stylized artwork... I’m gonna have to\r\nlook into this some more.[VAR 0114(000B)]

Gym Challenger.\nWould you like to challenge our Gym?
Of course!
Hold on...
Then please change into your uniform in the\nlocker room.\c\nThis will not be a mission so much as a test of\nyour quality.\c\nIt is a very serious examination.
That uniform looks good on you.\nNow relax, clear your mind, and go break a leg.
Goodness... That is a shame.\nHow quick you were to give up.
I hope you enjoy the little examination we call\nour Gym’s mission.
You received a TM from Leader Opal, yes?\c\nThe next Gym waits for you in Circhester.
The Fairy Badge suits you.\nKeep up the fine work, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)].

Ah, there you are, my dear Gym Challenger.\nThough you are really lacking in the color pink.[VAR 0114(0013)]
See, I’m looking for a successor to take on\nthe role of Gym Leader here.\r\nSo my Gym mission serves as an audition of\r\nsorts, too.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Oh, don’t worry. It’s simple enough.\c\nAll you need to do is battle my Trainers and\nanswer the questions they ask along the way.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Think carefully before answering, though, child.\nIf you get the wrong answer, the stats of your\r\nPokémon will get lowered.\c\nOh, but if you answer correctly, your Pokémon\nwill get a stat boost.\c\nJust think of it as a little Fairy-type Pokémon\nmagic to make things interesting.[VAR 0114(0013)]

I want to withdraw
I’m good
Try to achieve victory while answering the\nquestions given by the Gym Trainers!
If you withdraw, you’ll have to start over the next\ntime you give the mission a try. So, are you sure?
Then I look forward to your next attempt!
In that case, good luck!
Enjoying the Gym mission?
Congratulations! You have successfully\ncompleted the Gym mission!\c\nNow, I wonder if you’ve met the standards of the\nGym Leader.\c\nWould you like to immediately challenge the\nGym Leader, Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]?
I’m good to go!
I need some time
Right! Then head on in!\nGive my regards to the Gym Leader!
Of course. You probably need to save a record\nof your progress and whatnot.
All right, OK. It’s time to start your audition to\nsee if you’re worthy of becoming the Fairy-type\r\nGym Leader.
I see...\c\nI can’t say what Ms. Opal will think, but you’ve\nat least piqued my interest.
I’m the second Trainer. Don’t worry about the last\nquestion. Let’s keep moving forward.
Don’t worry about right or wrong. Just keep\nmoving forward.
I’m next. I think you might have what it takes to\nbecome the Fairy-type Gym Leader.
We should be focusing on the Gym Challenge,\nbut Ms. Opal insisted on making this an audition.

Well, good try.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Not bad, not bad at all.\nStill, not what I’m looking for...\c\nOh, don’t worry yourself about it, child.\nIt’s just a matter of my preference.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I’ll find the next Gym Leader elsewhere.\c\nIn fact, I’ve already got an idea about where\nto look.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Too bad about the audition, but here’s a Fairy\nBadge for your efforts.[VAR 0114(0013)]
You can now catch Pokémon of up to Lv. 45!
Take this TM with you, too.\nA little bonus from this old lady.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Lastly, here’s a little something for humoring me.\nThis might help add a little more pink to you![VAR 0114(0013)]
Of course it’s not good to neglect your elders,\nbut old folk like me should also know when it’s\r\ntime to step out of the spotlight.[VAR 0114(0013)]
There were a total of six questions!\c\nChallenger [VAR 0100(0000)], you got...\n[VAR 0200(0001)] of them correct.

Of course!
Not really...
Well, I suppose so.\nYou no longer have to worry about catching up\r\nwith me, after all.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I commend your humility. It is appropriate for a\nTrainer of your...limited talents.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’ll have you know, though, that I haven’t given up!\c\nI must become the Champion in order to help\nout the chairman! I will go and ask him to let me\r\nrejoin the Gym Challenge![VAR 0114(000C)]
So sincere and straightforward and yet so\ntwisted and misguided...\c\nI like it! That’s the kind of thing that gives people\nsome depth![VAR 0114(0013)]

There may be some things you can’t overcome\nwithout pushing yourself at least a little.

The reason you’ll need it is simple.\nThere are invisible pitfalls everywhere in here!
If you fall into one, you’ll have to start again\nfrom the last platform you reached.\c\nThe detector will vibrate when there’s a pitfall\nin front of you. The closer the hole, the stronger\r\nthe vibration!
Then on with you! And good luck!

Hmm... Perhaps when their duty was completed,\nthey went into some kind of sleep?[VAR 0114(000B)]

The Hero’s Bath...\c\nThey say this is where the two heroes came\nto soothe their wounds after the battle to bring\r\ndown that evil presence, long ago.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Nowadays only Pokémon really use the\nHero’s Bath, though...\c\nHmm... Who exactly were the heroes that\nbathed here?\c\nI think I’ll have to look into that.[VAR 0114(000B)]
You two met a mysterious Pokémon back in\nthe Slumbering Weald...\c\nPerhaps...you two can become new heroes.[VAR 0114(000B)]
What, like some hero waving around a sword and\nshield? Pull the other one.\c\nThough...I guess I’d fancy a shield, if I had to\ntake my pick.[VAR 0114(0005)]
What, like some hero waving around a sword and\nshield? Pull the other one.\c\nThough...I guess I’d fancy a sword, if I had to\ntake my pick.[VAR 0114(0005)]
What kind of battle do you think the heroes had\nback then?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Why don’t we show her, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nThink we can pull off a real heroic battle?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Absolutely!
Give me a minute...
I’ve been getting stronger and stronger lately!\nI won’t lose to Lee, some hero, or even you,\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)]! Come and have a go![VAR 0114(0005)]
All right, I get it. Prepare as much as you like![VAR 0114(0005)]
Sonia treated us to a great meal. After that\ncurry, I feel like I’ve got the energy to wrestle\r\na Bewear![VAR 0114(0005)]
I don’t entirely understand your reasoning, but I\nmight just as well see what you can do.\r\nI’ll heal up your Pokémon for you, [VAR 0100(0000)],\r\nso give it your best![VAR 0114(000B)]
Time for a little exhibition match, starring the\nfuture Champion![VAR 0114(0005)]
Thanks! You two gave a right proper battle...\nAt the rate you both are going, even the\r\nunbeatable Leon may be in trouble![VAR 0114(000B)]
So what’s next, you two? I plan to look into\nthings in the Slumbering Weald.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m going to keep challenging that Gym!\c\nThen, once I get that Gym Badge, I’ll be heading\nfor Route 9 to take on Spikemuth next.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Seems like he finally shook off that gloom.\nLeon’d worry if Hop wasn’t feeling all right.\c\nAs his rival, you wouldn’t like it either, right?\nSee ya.[VAR 0114(000B)]

There’s no way we’re lettin’ you anywhere\nnear Spikemuth! And that means we can’t let you\r\ngo on to Route 9![VAR 0114(0043)]
It’s Team Yell’s duty to cheer on these\nlovely Drednaw!\c\nAnd we also get to stop people from headin’ out\nover the water![VAR 0114(0044)]
Ba bite!
Yes, I understand...\nAll I’m saying is that I can make it so that\r\nRotom Bikes can ride on water...
Why, we meet again, my young Gym\nChallenger friend!\c\nRemember me? I gave you that bike!\nSo, do you think you could do me another favor\r\nand teach these ruffians a lesson or two?
It’s our duty to protect Drednaw!\c\nAnd that means yer gonna need to give up on\nthe Gym Challenge!\c\nYou look like you need convincin’, so how\nabout a Pokémon battle?![VAR 0114(0043)]
Then clear off, would ya?\nWe’re busy cheerin’ on Drednaw![VAR 0114(0043)]
I’ll send you packin’!\nFor the sake of Drednaw, of course.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Even if you reach Spikemuth, it’s not like you’re\ngonna be able to do the Gym Challenge.\c\nWhy not just give up now?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Gah! [VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe’s gonna ride the Drednaw![VAR 0114(0043)]
Oi! I’ve got an idea! We can get on Drednaw\nfirst and ride it away![VAR 0114(0044)]
All right! Get a move on, Drednaw!\nSee ya later, Gym Challenger![VAR 0114(0043)]
Ba bite!
Seems you’ve come to my aid yet again.\c\nHow’s the cycling life been treating you?\nAre you having fun?
Wouldn’t it be great if you could ride your\nRotom Bike on the water, too?
That’s why I’m going to add these special parts,\nallowing it to travel along the water’s\r\nsurface...just for you!
All right, all right! With the Rotom Bike\n“Water Mode,” you’ll cruise across the water\r\nlike a Pokémon with Swift Swim!\c\nBy the by, when you’re riding on land, we’ll call it\n“Land Mode.”

No one can challenge the Dark-type Leader\nlike this...
What’s with the gate being shut? How am I\nsupposed to get the Gym Badge now?!

Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000D)]
I was born ’ere so I know another way in.[VAR 0114(000D)]
If you wanna get into the town, how ’bout I\nshow you the way?\c\nBut...you’re my rival. So you’ll have to beat\nme in a battle first, got it?[VAR 0114(000D)]
With pleasure!
Let me think about it
Oh, did I misjudge you...?\c\nAhhh, I get it. You need to get ready!\nGo on, then! I’ll wait here until you’re ready.[VAR 0114(000D)]
You’ve had a pretty good win streak in the Gym\nChallenge, just like me! I respect you as my rival\r\nand all that, but I got too much at stake to go\r\naround losin’ now![VAR 0114(000D)]
My partner Morpeko has been interested in\nyou and your strength, and I think I get it now.\c\nBut I’ve got everyone in Spikemuth\nsupportin’ me![VAR 0114(000D)]
I’m definitely gonna get all eight Gym Badges\njust so I can have a rematch with you.\r\nDon’cha forget it!\c\nI’ll get my revenge in the Champion Cup![VAR 0114(000D)]
Anyway, I promised I’d show you a way in, so\nfollow me![VAR 0114(000D)]

With the shutter closed, nobody’s gonna be\nable to challenge the Gym...\r\nI gotta look into this.[VAR 0114(000D)]
I just happened to have too many of these, so I’ll\ngive you one, got it?\c\nYou can handle yourself, right?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Oi! Welcome to Spikemuth, kid!\nHope yer ready for the Gym mission![VAR 0114(0045)]
’Old on, mate. If you’re gonna take on the Gym\nmission, you’d better change into yer uniform![VAR 0114(0045)]
If you’re lookin’ for the Gym Leader, he’s straight\nahead from here![VAR 0114(0045)]
If you head back, you’ll be retirin’. Do you\nwanna retire?[VAR 0114(0045)]
Step past there, and you’ll be givin’ up![VAR 0114(0045)]
Only one healthy Pokémon? You thinkin’ about\nturnin’ tail and yelleavin’?[VAR 0114(0045)]
You seriously beat Piers? Here—a\nTM to remember this moment![VAR 0114(0045)]
Hey! There’s some trouble over on Route 9!\nIt’s so bad, even the Champion’s come to sort\r\nthings out!\c\nOh, hey! You gave Piers a thrashing, didn’t you?\nYou should head over there to help. C’mon, then!\r\nI’ll show you the way.
Me? I’m just here as a part-time job. I’m fi-yellin’\nin for the proper League staff.[VAR 0114(0045)]
The Gym Leader’s waitin’ for you!\nGo right on ahead if you want to get trounced![VAR 0114(0045)]

Gym Challenger.\c\nYou wanna get past me, but I don’t want that.\nBasically, it’s a battle between our desires.[VAR 0114(0045)]
I don’t wanna let you through! That’s why I was\nwaitin’ all squeezed in this crack.\c\nBut since I lost, it was really all for nothin’!\nWhatever. You won, so I guess I’ll step aside.[VAR 0114(0045)]
D’you know the Pokémon move Light Screen?[VAR 0114(0045)]
What’s this? A Gym Challenger made it through?\nAll us Team Yell members have blocked the way.\r\nDon’t think we’ll just let you waltz through![VAR 0114(0045)]
That was...totally unbelievable. Even my\nPokémon are in awe of you and your team.\c\nHere, go on through. Check out our neon signs\nwhile you’re at it.[VAR 0114(0045)]
Mr. Mime is a dancin’ Pokémon... It makes for a\ncheery member of our team.[VAR 0114(0045)]
I’m yellin’ for no reason![VAR 0114(0045)]
Did I surprise you? I’m a little surprised how\nmuch my legs hurt from that landin’!\c\nIf I stand still like this for too long, it’ll hurt\nso bad I might cry...\c\nSo I’ll shake it off with a battle![VAR 0114(0045)]
Well, it’s true that I lost, but I pushed through\nthe pain, so you should praise me for that!\c\nAll right! Now that the pain’s gone, I guess I’d\nbetter get outta here.[VAR 0114(0045)]
The HP of your Pokémon not lookin’ so good?[VAR 0114(0045)]
I practiced that back handspring so much, even a\npop star would be jealous of those moves.\r\nWere you surprised? Oi, be surprised, you!\c\nWhile you’re in utter shock, I’m gonna sneakily\nwin this battle![VAR 0114(0045)]
I shoulda been practicin’ my battle skills, not\nmy backflip skills...\c\nThanks for showin’ me that. Guess I’ll cheer for\nyou from now on.[VAR 0114(0045)]
Team Yell takes the field! This might be the\nGym Challenge, but I won’t let you ruin our\r\ncool secret hangout![VAR 0114(0045)]
What?! You only got one healthy Pokémon?\c\nOi, don’t come back unless you got a Revive\nor somethin’—got it?[VAR 0114(0045)]
All right, time for a pincer attack! We’ll do\nwhatever it takes to win![VAR 0114(0045)]
Ah! I didn’t have enough time to get my\ndisguise ready!\c\nThat’s right! Team Yell is actually made up\nof Spikemuth Gym Trainers!
Ugh, whatever! Our Gym Leader’s up next, but\nhe’s really strong. Got that?[VAR 0114(0045)]
I mean, everybody already knew the true identity\nof Team Yell, right?\c\nThat means I won’t get in trouble for not gettin’\nmy disguise on, right? I sure hope so...
Bari bari!
There’s some kind of invisible wall!\nYou can’t get through, no matter how you try!

Uh... I’m really sorry!\c\nThe lot from Spikemuth’s tellin’ me they\nlocked down the city for my sake...[VAR 0114(000D)]
Spikemuth just keeps gettin’ worse and worse.\nAnd all Piers says is “Don’t worry”...[VAR 0114(0043)]
So... So we decided to disguise ourselves as\nTeam Yell and sabotage the other challengers.[VAR 0114(0044)]
We thought, if we could stop the other\nGym Challengers from reachin’ the Gym, then\r\nMs. Marnie would be the only one to win and\r\nmake it to the Champion Cup![VAR 0114(0043)]
And we figured that’d increase the chances of\nour wonderful Ms. Marnie becomin’ the\r\nnew Champion![VAR 0114(0044)]
*sigh*\nThat’s no way to help someone at all![VAR 0114(000D)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], no need to bother with all the\npreparations, or whatever.\c\nGo on in and face the Gym Leader![VAR 0114(000D)]
Oh man, Ms. Marnie’s scoldings go on forever...\c\nI remember once she scolded her Morpeko\nfor so long, it practically fell asleep...[VAR 0114(0043)]
I can hear Piers just rockin’ away. His Pokémon\nchorus sounds pretty great, too.[VAR 0114(0044)]
I’m gonna be givin’ Piers my best yells durin’ his\nbattle with you![VAR 0114(005E)]

*sigh*...\nSo you’re finally here, huh?[VAR 0114(0042)]
See, I’m...I’m really not a great Gym Leader.\c\nFigured that’s why nobody was comin’ to\nchallenge me.[VAR 0114(0042)]
I have good ears, so I overheard the whole thing\nabout the city bein’ shut up.\c\nWhen I was alone, it was like my soul\nwas weepin’.[VAR 0114(0042)]
This is a simple Gym Stadium. We can’t even\nDynamax our Pokémon, but well...\c\nI still hope you enjoy the battle.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Now then...[VAR 0114(0042)]
I’m the Gym Leader of Spikemuth,\nPiers, the Dark-type user![VAR 0114(0016)]
You wanna challenge me, even though you\nknow you’ll lose?\c\nThen this song’s for you, foolish Trainer![VAR 0114(0016)]
Get ready for a mosh pit with me and my party!\nSpikemuth, it’s time to rock![VAR 0114(0016)]
I’m glad we were able to battle. Seems like my\nPokémon feel the same way.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Here’s your Dark Badge.[VAR 0114(0016)]
You can now catch Pokémon of up to Lv. 55!
Here’s a uniform, too...\c\nI’ve actually been thinkin’ about just sellin’\nthem at my concerts.[VAR 0114(0016)]

I was watchin’ YOUR battle, Bro. It’s how I\nlearned to battle an’ all that.[VAR 0114(000D)]
That right?\c\nThat reminds me. Marnie, there’s somethin’ I\nwanted to tell you.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I want you to take over the Gym here in\nSpikemuth as its Gym Leader.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Yeah, I know.\c\nYou’d planned to retire after the\nChampion Cup, right?[VAR 0114(000D)]
I think you’ve really become a great Gym Leader,\neven if you don’t Dynamax your Pokémon.[VAR 0114(000D)]
I love you, but my answer is a big, fat “NO”![VAR 0114(000D)]
I mean, when I end up becomin’ Champion, I\nwon’t be able to be a Gym Leader![VAR 0114(000D)]
Good point.\c\nIn that case, let your big bro see if you have\nthe skill to be a Champion![VAR 0114(0016)]

I already told you, didn’t I?\nKeep your eye on the goal!\r\nAnd for you, that’s winning the Gym Challenge![VAR 0114(0004)]
The only Gym Badge left is the one you’ll get\nfrom the Dragon Gym’s Leader, Raihan. Right?\c\nRaihan is the only Trainer out there I consider a\nreal rival. He’s that good, you know![VAR 0114(0004)]

Take a look at the news![VAR 0114(0005)]

Well, I am the unbeatable Champion, after all!\nBut what all is going on here?[VAR 0114(0004)]
An overflowing red light...\nPokémon Dynamaxing without a Power Spot?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Yeah, but why?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m not sure... What’s going on?\nThat red light could suddenly appear again at\r\nany time and we’d have no way of knowing.[VAR 0114(000B)]
But being able to predict such things is part of\na scientist’s work.[VAR 0114(0042)]

The chairman called for me.\c\nHe wanted to know all about the red light’s\nrelationship to the Dynamax phenomenon.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Did the chairman know anything?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Nothing worth my time. The chairman’s all\nwrapped up in fretting over the future of\r\nour energy, apparently.\c\nHe’s left everything to that executive lady.\nWe just don’t have enough data.[VAR 0114(000A)]
That’s why I wanted to ask you to start looking\ninto things, too, Sonia.\c\nYou know more than anyone about the\nDarkest Day, after all.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Are you saying that red light and the\nDarkest Day are connected?![VAR 0114(000B)]
Hey, do you reckon there’s anything we could do\nto help out?[VAR 0114(0005)]
There must be!
Yeah, we’ll help!
Thanks! I appreciate the thought.\c\nBut all I could ever ask of you would be that you\njoin me in the greatest final match ever.\c\nI’ll do my part to make that happen by keeping\neverybody’s future safe.\c\nSo you just keep on doing your part by winning\nyour way through the Gym Challenge![VAR 0114(0004)]
Right. Course!\nYou’re the unbeatable Champion, after all, eh?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Gran, there’s something I want to look into.\nYou’ll help me, right?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Naturally.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Looks like we all know what we need to do.\nSo, you two—clear the Gym Challenge so we can\r\nmeet again at the Champion Cup![VAR 0114(0004)]
I know what I need to do, all right—\ndefeat that Piers once and for all!\c\nYou’re off to Hammerlocke Stadium, yeah,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]? Raihan’s a tough nut to crack![VAR 0114(0005)]

You bet I am!
Maybe another time...
You must remember that [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she who dares, wins.
In that case, please use the changing room to\nchange into your uniform.
That uniform you wear is a symbol of all of your\nvictories. I feel your determination.\c\nNow, head to where all the Gym Trainers await...\nNo, not the stadium, but the vault!
Ah, one moment!\c\nYou need at least two battle-ready Pokémon\nto face Raihan!
The Gym mission, right?\nTogether with your partner, you can’t lose!
That uniform fits you to a tee!\nHead on in, number [VAR 01C4(0001)]!
Hold on there! If you want to face Raihan, you\nfirst need to gather seven Gym Badges.\c\nOnly then will Raihan even think about letting\nyou face him!

Let’s see, how many Gym Challengers are left?\nHuh... Not even ten, eh?[VAR 0114(0017)]
All right then.\c\n[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]!\nTime to explain the great Raihan’s Gym mission![VAR 0114(0017)]
The rules are simple!\c\nAll you’ve got to do is defeat three Gym Trainers\nthat I personally trained—in Double Battles![VAR 0114(0017)]
The Gym Challenge is meant to be, well...\nchallenging, wouldn’t you say?\c\nNaturally there aren’t too many Gym Challengers\nwho can make it this far.[VAR 0114(0017)]
And that’s why I provide a format where you can\nreally show off the brilliant combinations you\r\nand your Pokémon should be capable of![VAR 0114(0017)]
That’s probably more than enough out of me.\nTime for someone else to take the spotlight!\c\nCome on, Sebastian! You’ll be first![VAR 0114(0017)]
Yeah, that’s me. Sebastian.\c\nLeader Raihan has taught me two things!\nFirst, that Dragon types are ferociously powerful!\r\nSecond, I need to create an advantage on the\r\nbattlefield to fully utilize that power!
I can see why you’ve managed to make\nit this far!
In Double Battles, it’s important to figure out\nwhat role each of your opponent’s Pokémon play.
It looks like you don’t have two Pokémon\nthat can battle.
Fantastic! I can see those seven Badges you\nhave were well-earned!
A Double Battle...\c\nDo you combine the strength of two Pokémon to\npush through, or do you have one of them\r\nsupport the other?\c\nLet me see what your strategy is!
The Gym mission here requires you to participate\nin Double Battles.\c\nYou need to have at least two Pokémon ready\nfor battle...
Well done!\c\nI am honored to have battled against such a\ntalented Trainer.
If you manage to beat the Trainer who was\nbeside me, you’ll face me next.
Something the matter, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nYou’re not done with my Gym mission yet.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Never mind
I want to withdraw

Hah! Then hurry up and get it over with!\nI want to battle you already![VAR 0114(0017)]
Are you sure you want to withdraw?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Fair enough.\c\nBut you’re not the type to simply give up, right?\nI’ll be waiting for you to come back soon.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Nice one, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nYou’ve completed my Gym mission!\c\nCome on. Time to head to the Gym Stadium.\nYou’ve earned the right to face me yourself![VAR 0114(0017)]
Time to face the second Trainer!\nCome on, Camilla![VAR 0114(0017)]
You’ve made it to the third and last Trainer!\nYour moment to shine, Aria![VAR 0114(0017)]

But I guess I should’ve expected no less from a\nPokémon Trainer that Leon saw promise in.[VAR 0114(0017)]
And you aim to defeat Leon...\c\nDo you have any idea just how high a hurdle\nthat is?\c\nAs his greatest rival, I guess that I—Raihan—will\nhave to show you![VAR 0114(0017)]
Gym Leader Raihan doesn’t simply control the\nweather. He also seeks two-on-two battles!\c\nYou must be prepared for any situation against\na foe like him![VAR 0114(0017)]
In the aftermath of the furious battle...\c\nI feel as pure and refreshed as when the sky\nclears after a storm.[VAR 0114(0017)]
What can I possibly say?\c\nCalling myself Leon’s rival?\nSeems I’d grown quite conceited for someone\r\nwho can’t even claim the title of Champion!\c\nOverconfident in both myself and my team![VAR 0114(0017)]
I’ll give you what you want, then.\nThe proof of your victory—the Dragon Badge![VAR 0114(0017)]
You can now catch Pokémon of any level!
You’ve collected all of the Gym Badges from\nthe Galar region![VAR 0114(0017)]
Now, win your way through the Semifinals and\nFinals for your chance to challenge Leon!\r\nYou must!\c\nYou owe us that much at least, for beating us in\nbattle here today![VAR 0114(0017)]
You’ve collected all of the Gym Badges...\nAt last it’s time for the Champion Cup!\r\nI look forward to seeing how you all do in battle!
Please accept my congratulations on making\nit through the Gym Challenge!
Do you want to go back to the reception area?

Hey! [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0017)]
Sorry to hold you up, but there\nwas something I forgot.[VAR 0114(0017)]
First off, as a sign of my respect...\nHere. TM99. It contains the move Breaking Swipe.[VAR 0114(0017)]
And secondly...here’s the Dragon-type Gym\nuniform, the mark of true strength![VAR 0114(0017)]
Number [VAR 01C4(0001)], Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nYou’ve completed the Gym Challenge!\c\nGood on you, kid. Now, prove your strength to\nthe whole region at the Champion Cup![VAR 0114(0017)]
Raihan! I’m here to see just how good you are![VAR 0114(0005)]
There you are, Leon’s little brother!\c\nDon’t worry—I’ll give you a battle that’ll make\nyou want to quit the Gym Challenge altogether![VAR 0114(0017)]
I’ve tried out lots of different strategies, and I’ve\nmade up my mind about how I want to battle.\r\nI’m not gonna lose!\c\nI’m gonna beat you, and [VAR 0100(0000)], and\neven Lee![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll be seeing you, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nLet’s have another epic battle someday!\c\nIf you’re feeling up to it, you might want to go\ntrain hard in the Wild Area![VAR 0114(0017)]

Text File : main_event_1440
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hey there, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nYou gave Raihan a good thrashing, and that\nmeans you’ve completed the Gym Challenge!\c\nCongratulations, from the bottom of my heart![VAR 0114(000B)]
I really wish we could go celebrate, but I think\nthere’re some things we should talk over.[VAR 0114(000B)]
That light that covered Hammerlocke...\c\nIt was just like the Darkest Day, where it’s said\nthat giant Pokémon went on a rampage and\r\nalmost destroyed the entire Galar region.[VAR 0114(000B)]
It certainly seems to be that way, my dear.\c\nAs you know, we Dynamax our Pokémon today\nusing the energy from Wishing Stars that have\r\nfallen to us.[VAR 0114(000A)]
But we still don’t know how to fully control the\nenergy behind Dynamaxing or how the two\r\nheroes managed to do so.\c\nIn fact, we’re not even really sure who—or what—\nthe two heroes actually were.[VAR 0114(000A)]
The legendary sword and shield...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Sonia, my dearest...\nMy lab coat is yours now.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Are you sure, Gran? I still haven’t finished the\nwork you’ve assigned me.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Think of this as something to help you finish\nthat work.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Professor Sonia!
It looks great!
Y-yeah![VAR 0114(000B)]
The two heroes that protected the Galar region\nfrom the Darkest Day...\c\nAnd the legend of the sword and shield you just\nmentioned... It’s up to you to figure out the truth\r\nbehind it all.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I know, Gran![VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ll do what I can! You or Hop could be the one\nto take down Leon, and I don’t want to miss that!\c\nNot to worry—you can count on me to take care\nof everything!\c\nYou just focus on getting to Wyndon. Go on!\nHead to the station, or you’ll miss your train![VAR 0114(000B)]
The station’s near Route 7, remember?\nNow, off with you, Gym Challenger![VAR 0114(000B)]
There are things that only young people like\nyou can do, and there are other things that\r\nshould be left to the adults.\c\nEveryone has their own role.[VAR 0114(000A)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_1450
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Wait up, [VAR 0100(0000)]! I’m coming, too!\c\nI had Raihan beat in no time!\c\nOnce I got my head on straight and stopped\ndoubting every decision I made, that is... Heh![VAR 0114(0005)]
And you never stopped nattering on through\nthe entire battle...\c\nYou’re pretty different from the Champion in that![VAR 0114(0017)]
But your strength is genuine, as proven by the\nDragon Badge you won from me.\c\nYou came at me with all the force of a raging\nstorm, and even I was blown away![VAR 0114(0017)]
Listen up, you two!\c\nBattle your way through the Champion Cup\ntournament to face Leon! One of you ought to![VAR 0114(0017)]
I reckon I’m still the favorite to win, but I’m up\nagainst my true rival, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nSo I’ll wring out every last thing I learned during\nmy battle with you, Raihan, to beat h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer![VAR 0114(0005)]
So get a move on, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nThe train’s waiting![VAR 0114(0005)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_1460
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
So this is Route 10!\nIt’s like a wall made out of snow![VAR 0114(0005)]
Bet there’ll be Ice-type Pokémon crawling out\nof the woodwork in a place like this![VAR 0114(0005)]
Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nReckon we’ll be able to train ourselves up to new\nheights here, before the Champion Cup starts?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I believe in myself and the Pokémon on my team,\nand I know we’ll all get loads stronger![VAR 0114(0005)]
So I’m off!\nSee you in Wyndon, mate![VAR 0114(0005)]

That’s it!\nI’m headed straight for Wyndon Stadium![VAR 0114(0005)]

[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], correct?\c\nWe’ve been watching over your performance in\nthe Gym Challenge.\c\nThis is just a formality, of course, but I’ll need\nto check your Gym Badges, if you don’t mind.

I guess it is what it is...\c\nCome on, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nWe should head to the locker room![VAR 0114(0005)]
This is it. I really made it.\c\nI made it through the Gym Challenge. There\nmight be four remainin’ in the Semifinals...\c\nBut I’m the one who’s gonna win through\nand battle the Champion.[VAR 0114(000D)]

We’ve been expecting you,\nChallenger [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nAs the Champion Cup is about to begin, allow\nme to explain how it works...\c\nFirst, there are the Semifinals, where you will face\nthe other Trainers who completed the\r\nGym Challenge.\c\nIf you manage to win in the Semifinals, you will\nthen face the top seven Gym Leaders of the\r\nGalar region in the Finals.\c\nDefeat them, and you will finally be able to face\nthe Champion in the Championship Match.
The matches will begin shortly.\nPlease ready yourself and head to the pitch.

You again, eh?\nWell, best of luck to you, kid.\c\nNot that it’ll do you a lick of good.\nMarnie’s sure to win this thing.[VAR 0114(0043)]

Heh. I knew you’d get all the Badges and meet\nme here.[VAR 0114(000D)]
I know that there’s been a lot between us, what\nwith my big brother, Team Yell, helpin’\r\nSpikemuth and all that...[VAR 0114(000D)]
But the truth is, when all’s said and done...\nI really just wanna become Champion for myself![VAR 0114(000D)]
So don’t take it personal when I kick your butt![VAR 0114(000D)]
Everyone in the stadium was watchin’ us durin’\nall that...\c\nI heard them cheerin’ for me and my Pokémon.\nIt was nice...[VAR 0114(000D)]
I may have lost, but...\c\nAt least we drove the audience wild!\c\nGuess that’s not so bad![VAR 0114(000D)]
Think I’ll join my brother in the stands, and\nwe’ll watch from the sidelines to see who ends\r\nup challengin’ the Champion.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Just so y’know... I still haven’t decided if\nI’m gonna cheer for you... See ya![VAR 0114(000D)]

After seeing the way you battled, I can’t accept\nany outcome besides winning this match!\c\nMy team is on fire![VAR 0114(0005)]
Pardon me...
I know you didn’t get a long break, but the match\nbefore yours ended more quickly than expected...
Challenger Hop won quite handily, so as soon as\nyou’re ready, we’d like you back on the pitch.

I just had this sort of flashback, you know.\nRemember? Back when we were still in Postwick.[VAR 0114(0005)]
When we got our Pokémon from Lee that day,\nI never would’ve dreamed that I’d end up\r\nstanding here...facing you, of all people.[VAR 0114(0005)]
But it’s time I finish what was started that day...\nGot it? The one who’ll become Champion is me![VAR 0114(0005)]
And the victor of the Semifinals, the challenger\nwho has won their way through all of the many\r\nhopeful Trainers in the Gym Challenge is...\r\nChallenger [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0018)]
You know, even when Sonia was saying that you\nand me looked like we could become heroes,\r\nI really never felt like one...[VAR 0114(0005)]
But you, mate! I think maybe you really could do\nall sorts of great things![VAR 0114(0005)]
Good on you, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nAnd [VAR 0101(0001)]![VAR 0114(0005)]

[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nThat was incredible. Brilliant.\c\nHonestly...there were even tears rolling down my\nface before I knew it.[VAR 0114(0004)]
To think that the two of you set out together\nfrom the same town, built up the greatest teams,\r\nand arrived here at this point to throw everything\r\nyou had at one another...[VAR 0114(0004)]
That burning desire to win...\nThose moves filled with undefeatable passion!\c\nIt was battling at its very purest, in every\npossible way![VAR 0114(0004)]
Even though there were some Trainers who\nweren’t sure whether you were fit to be endorsed\r\nfor the Gym Challenge at first...[VAR 0114(0004)]
That was you, Lee![VAR 0114(0005)]
Well then, all the more reason!\c\nMy team members and I will give everything that\nwe’ve got in us to defeat our challenger.[VAR 0114(0004)]
And the challenger standing before us might well\nend up being you, [VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nIn fact, that’s precisely what I’m hoping for![VAR 0114(0004)]
That’s right, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nThe real challenge is what’s coming next.[VAR 0114(0005)]
And I’m completely exhausted!\nI just want to head back to the hotel and rest.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Best to refill your energy stores first!\nWhy don’t we go get some dinner together?[VAR 0114(0004)]
I wouldn’t say no, but...\c\nyou never care at all what food tastes like, Lee!\c\nA night like this deserves more than rubbish\ntakeaway, so at least pick something good![VAR 0114(0005)]

Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nHey, Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]!
Got some time for questions?!
First question!\c\nYou and Challenger Hop were both endorsed by\nthe Champion, making the two of you rivals in a\r\nsense, wouldn’t you say?\c\nHow does it feel to have defeated your rival?
I’m glad I could beat him
It doesn’t quite feel real yet
It was just luck that I won
Right...\nQuestion number two!\c\nIf you wanted to tell Challenger Hop something\nright now, what would it be?
I’d thank him for the great match!
I’d tell him how strong he was
That he was just the rival I knew he was
Question three!\c\nLevel with me, kiddo. Your honest thoughts here.\nThink you can win the Finals, too?
I absolutely do
I’m not sure...
I doubt it, really...
All right—that’s enough!\n[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]’s already tired from battle!\r\nAnd you’ve been asking rather rude questions![VAR 0114(0005)]
We’ve got ourselves dinner plans with my brother,\nso, sorry, but clear off already, would you?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Yes, yes, I understand!\nLooking forward to seeing the birth of a new star!
Phew...\nFamous people sure have it rough, eh?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I hope Lee gets here soon.\nI could eat my own arm about now.[VAR 0114(0005)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_1570

Several hours later...
This is absurd...\nEven Lee’s never this late. Something’s not right.[VAR 0114(0005)]
He always does what he says he’ll do.\c\nAs a kid, he promised me he’d become Champion\none day, and he went and did just that![VAR 0114(0005)]
He ought to be able to keep to his own\ndinner plans![VAR 0114(0005)]
Kid’s sure got a mouth on him, huh?\c\nIf you were that noisy durin’ battle, you’d\nunleash a whole new level of power, you know.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Oh, pack it in, Piers!\nI’m seriously worried here!\c\nSo I don’t need to see your smug mug looking\nlike you’re having a go at me, even though you\r\nact like you’re giving me good advice![VAR 0114(0005)]
Judgin’ by appearances?\nNo wonder you lost to your mate.[VAR 0114(0016)]
If you’re lookin’ for the Champion, I saw him\nheadin’ to Rose Tower.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Why would he go there?
Rose Tower?
Dunno what he’s up to, but I ran into him at the\nmonorail platform.\c\nHe said to tell you that he had somethin’ to do\nat Rose Tower, so he’d be late to your dinner.[VAR 0114(0016)]
But why Rose Tower?\nWhat could he have to do there at this hour?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Piers, do us a favor.\nTake us to Rose Tower, would you?\c\nNeither [VAR 0100(0000)] nor I know the way.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Sheesh... What rude siblings, always so\ndemandin’ of others.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Though I s’ppose...\c\nIt’s a real problem for me, too, if the Finals are\nheld up for any reason.\c\nAnd I don’t really hate the two of you little runts.\nYou were good enough to beat me, after all.[VAR 0114(0016)]
So I think I’ll invite Team Yell along, and we’ll all\nhave ourselves a bit of fun. Shall we?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Brilliant! You’re the best, Piers!\nLet’s go make a real ruckus![VAR 0114(0005)]

Man, why am I here for this? I’m totally\nexhausted from that battle with\r\nyou, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(000D)]
We decided that Team Yell will cheer you on,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]. Let’s help out together.[VAR 0114(0016)]
What a beautiful display of sibling love!\nHowever, it is entirely unnecessary.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Ms. Oleana?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Chairman Rose is with the Champion in a very,\nvery important meeting...[VAR 0114(0007)]
There is no way I will let anyone interfere![VAR 0114(0007)]
After all, only authorized personnel with the\nproper key can ride the monorail to Rose Tower.[VAR 0114(0007)]
That means as long as Chairman Rose is in the\ntower, no one can disturb him![VAR 0114(0007)]
I have hand selected a member of the\nLeague staff and given them a key.\c\nChairman Rose does enjoy these kind of menial\ngames after all.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Do you think you can tell the difference between\nnormal League staff and the one I chose?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Do you think you can find me?
What should we do?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Tch. This isn’t good! But I got this one![VAR 0114(0016)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! Team Yell’s yellin’ will\nhandle this![VAR 0114(0016)]
No. This is brilliant! I’ll search around the front of\nthe stadium![VAR 0114(0005)]
For now, we should try to head to the plaza\ntogether, right?[VAR 0114(0016)]
All right, let’s all work together and head for\nRose Tower.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Hmm. You should be able to get to the plaza\nyourself, right?[VAR 0114(0016)]

Let’s find Oleana’s League staff member.\c\nThat bad one was wearin’ those lame\nshades, right?[VAR 0114(0016)]
That bad League staff member was wearin’ some\nawful shades.\c\nAnd the key to findin’ anyone is to just ask\neveryone you meet![VAR 0114(0016)]
Seems like nobody’s seen that bad League staff\nmember anywhere else.\c\nI bet they’re hidin’ somewhere nearby.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Makes sense for a cornered person to seek out\nthe tightest hidin’ place, I guess.\r\nDon’t s’ppose you got a box lyin’ around?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Guess that wraps up Oleana’s little game.\c\nCourse, I’m not one to talk, I guess.\nTeam Yell did their fair share of lame tricks...\c\nAnyway, let’s head to the station.[VAR 0114(0016)]
... ... ...
Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]! This bloke’s awfully shifty,\nbut I can’t get him to turn around!\c\nSay somethin’ surprisin’ so that he’ll have no\nchoice but to look this way!
Ms. Oleana’s here!
We already have the key, you know
What?!
Blast, I turned around!\c\nAnd I can’t escape?!\nIn that case, time for a Pokémon battle!
All I need to do is hide, and I won’t have to\ngive you the key!
It’s a wonder how fast that guy could run...\nI’ve got no idea where he went, guv.
How’d you find me...?\nOr did you just talk to everyone you met?!\r\nBah, whatever! I’ll defeat you this time!
They say hide a tree in a forest, so...\nI thought I could hide myself in the crowd!
You’re way too observant!\nBut I’ll win this time and make my getaway!
Seems like you’ve got me cornered...\c\nBut I’m not going to give up!\nAn earful from Ms. Oleana is way worse than\r\nanything you lot can do!\c\nGood luck catching me on the monorail!
Team Yell, go find Hop!\nWe’ll corner that League staff member at the\r\nstation together![VAR 0114(0016)]
You did a crackin’ job of cornerin’ that bad\nLeague staff member, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nLet me sing you a song fittin’ of your\nrockin’ deeds![VAR 0114(0016)]
The only thing a humble singer can do is sing a\nhumble song. ♪[VAR 0114(0016)]
Maybe I can’t cheer someone on just with the\ntunes I play. ♪[VAR 0114(0016)]
Maybe my songs don’t make anyone happy.\nMaybe I can’t help. ♪[VAR 0114(0016)]
But still the only thing I can do is sing—sing my\nhumble song. ♪[VAR 0114(0016)]
Piers!
Go Pieeerrrs!
Hey, isn’t that Piers?\nWhy’s he doing a street performance?
I think you mean a station performance.\nCome on—let’s see if we can get closer!
We got the key, Piers!\nWe can take the monorail to Rose Tower now!

Good thinking!\nLet’s go collect Lee and get out of here!\c\nWithout him, there’s no Champion for you to\nchallenge in the Champion Cup![VAR 0114(0005)]
’Fraid I can’t agree to that, mate.\c\nTeam Yell’s giving it their all to help us out so\nwe can go ahead and help Lee.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], you cleared the way to\nRose Tower.\c\nNow all you gotta do is charge on ahead.[VAR 0114(000D)]
An employee’s an employee I guess...\nSeems that exec lady hid the monorail key\r\nto try and impress the chairman.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Chairman Rose’s been keepin’ the Champion\nholed up inside. Wonder what he’s plottin’.[VAR 0114(000D)]
[~ 10]
Times like this—when tension and passion run\nhigh—remind me of Spikemuth in the old days.\c\nSome right wild concerts we had back then.\nBut no encores![VAR 0114(0016)]
Wait, you’re still here?[VAR 0114(0016)]
You better get goin’! I’ll send some support your\nway with a yell![VAR 0114(0016)]
Let’s go, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Gotta stick around to make sure my bro doesn’t\ndo anythin’ too crazy, right? Come back if you\r\nneed anythin’.[VAR 0114(000D)]

Whoa, it’s huge in here!\nWhat in the world is this place meant to be?![VAR 0114(0005)]
Listen, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nDon’t know if you knew this already, but I’ve\nheard Rose Tower was built on a Power Spot.\c\nYeah, you know what I’m saying...\nWhen we get up to the roof and have a bit of\r\nspace, we can Dynamax our Pokémon![VAR 0114(0005)]
Which is all well and good. But less certain is\nwhether this lift can get us to the top...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Rose Tower has, like, a hundred floors, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
You’ll be leaving right now, so there’s no need to\nworry about the lift!
Intruder alert.\nIntruder alert.\c\nAll staff are ordered to help remove the\nintruders from the premises at once.[VAR 0114(0007)]
See? If Ms. Oleana says so, then it looks like this\nis the end of the line for you kids.
If I get rid of the intruders, I’ll probably get a\nbig bonus!
M-my bonus...\nMy dream of finally affording a house of my own...
We need to speak with Chairman Rose!\nTell us where he is![VAR 0114(0005)]
Get on the lift.\nThe chairman’s at the top of the building.
All right! We’re nearly to Chairman Rose![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hold on, Lee! We’re coming![VAR 0114(0005)]
Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nLet’s crack on![VAR 0114(0005)]

This is taking ages...[VAR 0114(0005)]
What? I don’t think we’re at the roof yet...\nWhy have we stopped?[VAR 0114(0005)]
You two are Gym Challengers, aren’t you?\c\nThank you for taking part in the Galar League’s\nGym Challenge!\c\nYet I’m afraid that doesn’t give you the right to\ninterfere in our work.\c\nWe will drive you out to protect the many\nsubsidiary companies housed here in Rose Tower!
Behold the gloriously high-tech elevators of\nRose Tower, able to withstand Pokémon battles!\c\nThey are constructed by the subsidiary\nMacro Cosmos Construction!
If I’ve been defeated, I have little choice but to\nrespectfully retreat.\c\nYet I must ask once more that you please do not\ninterfere with Chairman Rose’s work.
The elevators in Rose Tower are constructed so\nthat only the floor ascends.\c\nBut that presents some danger, thus the presence\nof these walls constructed of light.\c\nYou can thank Macro Cosmos Construction for\nproviding this wonderful technology as well.
Wait... So the folks working in the tower can stop\nthe elevator from the outside at any time?\c\nWe’re just trying to get to the top already![VAR 0114(0005)]
Our teams have been working themselves ragged\nfor us. Let me heal them all up.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Rose Tower is almost a thousand feet tall!\nYou are now about five hundred feet above\r\nthe ground!
I’m from MC Insurance!\nDo you have a life insurance policy?
I’m quite terrified of heights, actually...
Unfortunately, our insurance doesn’t pay out\nfor being defeated in Pokémon battles...
You’re nearly to the top!\nBut you’ll not be meeting the chairman!
I’ve got no fear of heights!\c\nI work high in the skies doing my job for the\nlofty Macro Cosmos Air!
Don’t you presume to meet the chairman!\nYou’re not on the same level as such a great man!
You must know that in high-rises such as this one,\nthe higher up you go, the more important the\r\npeople you find working there.\c\nChairman Rose is at the top of the top!\nNot just of this tower, but of all Galar!
Looks as though we’re nearly there, mate...\nLook sharp! Let’s do this![VAR 0114(0005)]

Welcome to Chairman Rose’s exclusive space.\nHere, nearly a thousand feet above the earth![VAR 0114(0007)]
So, you got through all of the special staff that\nI had ordered to stop you.\c\nI would expect nothing less of the Trainers\nhandpicked by Champion Leon himself.[VAR 0114(0007)]
But I am afraid it is now time for you to\ngo home.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Because...[VAR 0114(0007)]
I will not allow anyone to disturb the great\nChairman Rose![VAR 0114(0007)]
You shall be the first, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nIf I beat you to pieces, then the Champion will\nhave no one to battle and will thus lose heart.\c\nIn that state, he will listen to anything the\nchairman says![VAR 0114(0007)]
Arghhh!\nThis is inexcusable...\c\nWhat was I thinking... Any Gym Challenger who’s\nmade it this far would be no pushover...[VAR 0114(0007)]
Under normal circumstances, I would have tried\nto delay you further.\c\nHowever, all the necessary Wishing Stars have\nbeen collected. Do as you wish. There is nothing\r\nto be done now.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Typical [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nYou and [VAR 0101(0001)] are unstoppable![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]... Stay on guard...[VAR 0114(0005)]

ROSE: Leon.\nWe’ve discussed this a hundred times already.\c\nAnd still you fail to understand what’s at stake?\nYou, who is supposed to be our Champion...[VAR 0114(0006)]
LEON: I think I understand well enough.[VAR 0114(0004)]
What I don’t understand is why we ought to\ncancel tomorrow’s tournament in order to solve\r\na problem that’s a thousand years away from\r\naffecting any of us!\c\nWhat difference is one day going to make?[VAR 0114(0004)]
My duty as Champion isn’t this...this madness.\nIt’s to carry out that Championship Match!\c\nThat’s what Galar wants—and what I want!\nIt’s what we’ve all been looking forward to\r\nfor so long![VAR 0114(0004)]
ROSE: No, you don’t understand...\nYou still don’t understand a thing![VAR 0114(0006)]
Look around us, Leon!\nLook at the Galar region stretched out before us.\c\nAnd know that the energy required to keep this\nbrilliant, glittering world alive will be exhausted\r\na millennium from now!\c\nThe people of Galar today will no longer even\nexist. What Galar wants today hardly matters![VAR 0114(0006)]
The future is more important than just one day!\nWe must act as quickly as we possibly can!\c\nWe must take action in order to avert tragedy!\nSo that all can look forward to a better future![VAR 0114(0006)]
LEON: In a thousand years!\c\nFine. Look.\nI think I understand your concerns, Chairman.\c\nAnd I give my word I’ll help you with your plans...\njust as soon as tomorrow’s match is over.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Lee...\c\nYou never showed when you were supposed to,\nso I got worried that something had happened...\c\nPiers and Marnie and all those Team Yell oddballs,\nthey all helped us out to get here...[VAR 0114(0005)]
I must apologize to you, Hop, if we’ve made you\nworry at all.\c\nThere are times when adults just can’t seem to\nhave an honest discussion with one another.\c\nSometimes our pride just gets in the way.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Never mind any of this, Hop, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nLet’s head back to the hotel, and we’ll all grab\ndinner together, yeah?\c\nIt’s on me, so you can order whatever you fancy.[VAR 0114(0004)]
If you’ll excuse us, Chairman Rose...\c\nAnd I do hope you’ll watch tomorrow’s match.\nIt’s sure to be one for the history books.[VAR 0114(0004)]

Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nThe Finals will be starting shortly.\nI’m here to escort you to the stadium.
What’s all this! Didn’t learn your lesson yesterday?!\c\nIf you need another helping of Hop and his trusty\n[VAR 0101(0001)], I’ll be happy to give you one![VAR 0114(0005)]
No! Wait, please!\c\nI’m not like those other League staff!\nI’m a good one! If I may say so myself...
I heard about what happened yesterday.\c\nMs. Oleana can be a little extreme in her desire\nto assist the chairman with his goals, I’m afraid.
It seems she was cultivating her own group of\nLeague staff in secret to be deployed for...\r\nwell...things like that debacle last night.
But you’ve no need to worry about today’s staff!\nAll of us are here for the right reasons.
Well, that’s what she says...\c\nI guess we trust her, then, yeah, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nLet’s go! I can’t wait another minute![VAR 0114(0005)]
Would you like me to show you the way to\nWyndon Stadium?

And they won’t be holding back.\c\nWhoever makes it through this final bracket will\nwin the right to challenge the Champion...\r\nSo, are you ready to go to the locker room now?
Yes, straightaway
Not yet
Then I’ll show you the way.
Then let me know when you’re ready.

Will you be heading onto the pitch?\nThe opening ceremony should be starting soon.
I’m ready!
Not yet
Then in you go!
Would you like to speak with the others for one\nlast spot of advice?
I’ll always press on and challenge myself so that\nI can go on as a Pokémon Trainer for as long\r\nas possible.\c\nAs long as you continue to push yourself, your\nbrilliance will never fade.[VAR 0114(0010)]
My first match is against Raihan of all people?\nWhat rotten luck...\c\nBut even if he changes the weather around,\nI don’t plan on throwing in the towel so easy.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Long time no see! This’ll be a different sort of\nbattle than you faced in the Gym Challenge.\c\nThose were basically test matches, but this...\nThis is serious battle.[VAR 0114(000F)]
It’s a curious feeling...\nMy heart is racing a bit, but I still can’t wait for\r\nthe match to begin![VAR 0114(0011)]
I’ll be bringing my matches to an end in\na heartbeat—you’ll see.\c\nNo one who sees them will ever forget me.[VAR 0114(0014)]
I’m going to win my way through every round,\nthen I’ll be the one taking on Leon!\c\nIf I don’t, then I’ll have failed to repay Duraludon\nand the rest of my team for all their hard work![VAR 0114(0017)]
I’d say I aim to win this thing...\c\nAnd I’ll do it without usin’ Dynamax, to help\neveryone in Spikemuth reclaim their pride...\r\nand to see ’em smile once again.[VAR 0114(0016)]
The opening ceremony will begin momentarily.\nPlease head to the pitch at once.

Wait, you![VAR 0114(0042)]
Who’s that?[VAR 0114(006B)]
A moment, if I may.\nDoes anyone here even remember me?\c\nI am Bede, the challenger who was forced to\nwithdraw from the Gym Challenge![VAR 0114(000C)]
Bede! He’s the challenger endorsed by Chairman\nRose himself![VAR 0114(006B)]
I have a score to settle with\nChallenger [VAR 0100(0000)] here.\c\nI’m aware that this is against the rules, but I must\nask nonetheless...\c\nLet me battle h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer! I’ll stake my career as a\nchallenger on this battle. If I lose, I’ll retire from\r\nbeing a Trainer.[VAR 0114(000C)]
What an unexpected turn of events!\c\nFormer Challenger Bede has come for one\nlast battle![VAR 0114(0018)]
We are currently debating what to do with\nChallenger Bede.\c\nTo all our viewers, both here in the stadium and\nat home in front of the telly, we ask that you\r\nplease be patient![VAR 0114(0018)]
I know this is ridiculous of me.\nBut I had to say something...do something![VAR 0114(000C)]
Ever since you showed up, everything I’ve done\nhas gone wrong!\c\nIt was Oleana who asked me to gather Wishing\nStars for the chairman, but then the chairman\r\nhimself disowned me...[VAR 0114(000C)]
And then that strange old lady comes out of\nnowhere and drags me into a boot camp on\r\nFairy-type Pokémon!\c\nDo you have any idea what I’ve been through?!\nCovered in pink, dealing with quizzes and battles\r\nwith Fairy-type Pokémon every day![VAR 0114(000C)]
And here I am, pouring my heart out to you...\nwhen I’ve never lost my cool before![VAR 0114(000C)]
We’ve reached a decision, ladies and gentlemen!\nThe Champion himself has accepted Bede’s\r\nsudden interruption!\c\nIs the Champion showing his love...by giving\nevery Trainer a chance to grow stronger?\r\nOr is it a trial for Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0018)]
My will hasn’t been broken yet![VAR 0114(000C)]
Well, I lost...[VAR 0114(000C)]
It looks like Challenger Bede was no match for\nChallenger [VAR 0100(0000)] and h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser trusted team![VAR 0114(0018)]
Hey, Bede! That was some match![VAR 0114(006B)]
Don’t retire! Just restart your career![VAR 0114(006B)]
B-but this isn’t what I planned!\c\nIf I was able to defeat you, then everything\nwould be fine.\c\nEven if I lost, I was going to use retiring as an\nexcuse to get away from that old lady![VAR 0114(000C)]
You just keep messing up my plans!\c\nWith everyone cheering me on like this, I have\nno choice but to continue my training as the\r\nFairy-type Gym Leader![VAR 0114(000C)]
Though I suppose with my talents, I’ll be able\nto overtake Ms. Opal in no time.[VAR 0114(000C)]
The stadium is filled with voices cheering on\nthese two young Trainers!\c\nNow, Challenger [VAR 0100(0000)], please head\nback to the locker room so that you can rest up\r\nfrom that unexpected match...[VAR 0114(0018)]
Rather surprising for Challenger Bede to barge\nin like that...\c\nIn any case, once you’re ready, please head onto\nthe pitch. The Finals are about to begin.

H[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser opponent is...\c\nthe raging wave!\nThe master of Water types, Nessa![VAR 0114(0018)]
I can tell you’ve grown far stronger since you\nfaced me in Hulbury Stadium.\c\nI’ve got to hand it to our undefeated Champion.\nHe’s got a proper eye for talent, too.[VAR 0114(000F)]
But you’re not the Champion, and you’ll never\nbecome the Champion, either.\c\nDo you know why? It’s because I, Nessa, am\ngoing to defeat both you and Leon![VAR 0114(000F)]
I’m not going to underestimate you again.\c\nI’ll use Dynamax to wash you out to sea and\nbeyond the horizon![VAR 0114(000F)]
Aaaaaand the winner is...[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe defeated Nessa during the Gym Challenge\nand now has pulled it off again![VAR 0114(0018)]
You and your Pokémon are just too much...\c\nEven with my Dynamaxed partner, you weathered\nour waves and stood firm.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Now that I think about it, Sonia was saying\nsomething about how amazing you were.\c\nI wish I’d paid more attention to what she\nwas talking about.[VAR 0114(000F)]
I bet everyone in Galar’s got their eyes on\nyou now.\c\nYou defeated my team, so now you’ve got to\nride that current all the way to the end![VAR 0114(000F)]

I really enjoyed battling you and your team...\c\nI’m upset that I lost, but I also feel so satisfied\nand so refreshed...[VAR 0114(0011)]
In a way, I guess you could say it was the best\nsort of match anyone could ever hope for.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I hope that you’ll meet many more Trainers\nand have many more matches in the future.\c\nAnd I hope that every one of those encounters\nwill nourish your spirit.[VAR 0114(0011)]

You’re really something else, kid.\nYou’ve made it all the way here!\c\nI guess that’s why the Champion himself\nendorsed you, yeah?[VAR 0114(0017)]

All right?\nThe big moment’s finally here, eh?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I came just to cheer you on, you know![VAR 0114(0005)]
Still, it’s not easy picking sides...[VAR 0114(0005)]
After all, it’s the showdown between my big\nbrother and my rival...\r\nWho should I really want to win more?[VAR 0114(0005)]

Right... You reckon I should cheer for\n[VAR 0100(0000)], too, don’t you?\c\nCouldn’t agree more. After all, we did start this\nthing out together, way back in Postwick.[VAR 0114(0005)]
So you better beat Lee, you hear?\c\nIf anyone can beat the unbeatable Champion,\nit’ll be you, mate.[VAR 0114(0005)]

The tense, still air on the pitch...\c\nAnd the exact opposite from the audience,\ncheering and yelling...\c\nThey’re both fantastic, wouldn’t you say?[VAR 0114(0004)]
But remember, the audience is also a bit cruel...\nThey want nothing more than to see one of us\r\nlose, after all![VAR 0114(0004)]
It can fill you with fear knowing that,\nbut I absolutely love pushing past the fear.\c\nI love giving it everything I’ve got as a Trainer\nand seeing my team give everything they’ve got\r\nto seize another victory!\c\nIt’s the greatest feeling in the world, and I can’t\nget enough of it![VAR 0114(0004)]
I can feel my partners itching with anticipation\ninside their Poké Balls...\c\nWe’re going to have a real champion time![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’m the Galar region’s Champion, Leon!\c\nMe and Charizard, and all the rest of our team,\nwill use all our knowledge and experience to\r\ncrush you completely![VAR 0114(0004)]

Lee! [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
That video stream...\nThat was from Hammerlocke Stadium, right?\r\nWhat in the world did the chairman do...?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I don’t know!\c\nBut everything he was saying yesterday...\nDid he really pull this crazy stunt to solve some\r\nproblem a thousand years in the future?!\c\nI’ve got to go see what’s going on...\nI’m the Champion! I have to go![VAR 0114(0004)]
I should’ve realized what the chairman intended\nto do before it came to this...\c\nI’ll take responsibility now for fixing this mess![VAR 0114(0004)]
This is the real Champion time![VAR 0114(0004)]
But, Lee! You’re terrible at directions...\nWhat if you get lost along the way?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I want to help my brother, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nI’ve got to!\c\nBut I can’t even manage to beat you, so what\nsort of help could I ever be...?[VAR 0114(0005)]
You can help!
Just try!
Easy for you to say...[VAR 0114(0005)]
But what? What can I even do?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hold the phone...\c\nThe chairman was talking about the Darkest Day.\nThat’s that thing where the sky went all dark\r\nonce, ages and ages ago, right?\c\nWhat does he mean, he’s bringing that about?\nAnd where did we even hear that name...?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Back in Motostoke
That statue of the hero...
That statue of the hero in Motostoke!\nSonia said something back then, didn’t she...\c\nThough it turned out to be wrong, since there\nwere actually two heroes and all that.\c\nStill! Those two managed to bring an end to the\nDarkest Day with the sword and shield Pokémon![VAR 0114(0005)]
Sonia thought the Pokémon might still be\nsleeping somewhere though, right?\c\nWe should try to find them, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nBut where to start looking...?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Back in the Slumbering Weald?
Back home in Postwick?
Maybe in Circhester?
You sure about that?\nI dunno... Doesn’t feel right to me.[VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s it, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nI’m sure it’s got to be the Slumbering Weald!\c\nThat illusion you tried to fight off that day—\nit must’ve been one of the Pokémon that are\r\nsupposed to be sleeping there![VAR 0114(0005)]
Let’s go back to the Slumbering Weald!\nIf we’re lucky, we’ll find something that can help![VAR 0114(0005)]

Huh? [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)] and Hop?\c\nAh! I completely forgot about the\nChampionship Match!\r\nWhat’re you two doing here?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Haven’t you been watching the news at all?\nThe tournament is off, Sonia!\c\nThe chairman saw to that—and to sending the\nentire region into a state of havoc![VAR 0114(0008)]
Huh?\c\nWhat?!\c\nWhat happened while I was researching things in\nthe Slumbering Weald?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Well, for starters, there’s a great black storm or\nsomething raging over Hammerlocke Stadium.\c\nWhat’re they calling it? “The Darkest Day”?\nIt’s thrown everything into disarray![VAR 0114(0008)]
Still, I’m sure we don’t need to worry too much...\c\nThe unbeatable Champion will be able to take\ncare of everything, won’t he?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Hold on a tick, ma’am. Did you say “the\nDarkest Day”?[VAR 0114(000B)]
“The Darkest Day” is the name for the\nblack storm that nearly brought the\r\nGalar region to ruin in ancient times...[VAR 0114(000B)]
So, what’re you here for, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m here to stop the Darkest Day!
To search for the sword Pokémon
To search for the shield Pokémon
To stop the Darkest Day...\c\nYou mean you’re going to search for the sword\nand shield Pokémon?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I suppose if the legends are true, then the sword\nand shield Pokémon should be able to prevent\r\nthe Darkest Day from coming to pass...\c\nThey may be just what we need to beat back\nthe black storm![VAR 0114(000B)]
OK! Here, take this.\nYou should head to the Slumbering Weald.\c\nI’ll catch up with you once I’m done looking\ninto something that’s been bothering me.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ve got to keep looking into the origin of the\nsword and shield Pokémon![VAR 0114(000B)]
All that matters is that you do what you can.\nYou’ve become a fine Pokémon Trainer,\r\nafter all![VAR 0114(0008)]

Going into the forest after Wooloo that day...\c\nThat was the start of everything, wasn’t it?\nA legendary beginning, really...[VAR 0114(0005)]

Hey! Where’re you going?!\nWe need your help over here![VAR 0114(0005)]
You two...\nWhat in the world are you doing?[VAR 0114(000B)]
What?! Come off it, Sonia!\nYou must’ve seen that, right?!\c\nThose...those...sword and shield Pokémon!\nThey were right in front of us!\c\nBut then they disappeared into the forest...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hop, you sure you haven’t lost the plot?\nThere was no one here but the two of you...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Wha...\nThen were those just...illusions or something?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Listen! I dug into some literature from other\nregions, and I finally found something!\c\nMentions of the sword Pokémon, Zacian,\nand the shield Pokémon, called Zamazenta.\c\nThe writings said that those two Pokémon were\nborn somewhere beyond the Slumbering Weald\r\nsometime long, long ago.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Did they really?\nTa, Sonia. Thanks for digging into it.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Even if it is just an illusion or whatever, we did\nmanage to find that Pokémon again...\c\nMaybe the sword and the shield that those two\nused to carry are still here, too![VAR 0114(0005)]
Zacian and Zamazenta...\c\nThey may have been sleeping in the Slumbering\nWeald right next to your hometown all this time.\c\nPerhaps that’s why no one has entered the\ndeepest parts of these woods for so long...[VAR 0114(000B)]

Would you take a look at that, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nNow that’s something you don’t see every day...\r\nThis place definitely feels like the stuff of legend.[VAR 0114(0005)]

That settles it!\nI’m taking the shield![VAR 0114(0005)]
That settles it!\nI’m taking the sword![VAR 0114(0005)]
Though...wow, would you look at the state\nof this thing?\c\nIt seems like it might fall to pieces if you so much\nas look at it funny.\c\nI don’t know if these rusty old things will really\nbe able to stop the Darkest Day, but...\c\nWell, I guess it can’t hurt to have them along!\nLet’s hope they bring us some good luck![VAR 0114(0005)]

Maybe the Pokémon themselves really are still\nasleep somewhere.\c\nSo it seems we’re on our own if we want to go\nhelp Lee. This is all the help we’ve got![VAR 0114(0005)]
If anybody’s gonna help Lee now, I guess it’s just\nyou and me, mate!\c\nHe’s probably still at Hammerlocke Stadium,\ntrying to keep the Darkest Day at bay.\c\nSo what d’you say, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nWanna grab a Flying Taxi to head right there?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Let’s go!
Not yet
Then let’s get out of this gloomy forest and fly\nback to Hammerlocke![VAR 0114(0005)]
Can’t say I blame you... Even I’m a bit gutted\nto have come all this way chasing legends\r\nonly to find a rusty old sword and shield...[VAR 0114(0005)]

Well, if it isn’t [VAR 0100(0000)] and Hop!\c\nIt’s a real shame, the way things have turned out.\c\nYou make it all the way to the Championship\nMatch, then something like this has to happen![VAR 0114(0017)]
And Chairman Rose thinking that the energy\npouring from the Darkest Day would somehow be\r\nthe key to saving Galar’s future?\c\nIt all seems a bit mad, if you ask me...\nI can’t follow at all how that’s supposed to work.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Well, I don’t care if I’m up against the Darkest\nDay or the chairman or whatever!\c\nI’m going ahead! I’m off to help my brother![VAR 0114(0005)]
And he’s gone... That Hop never changes.\nAlways in a rush about something, isn’t he?[VAR 0114(0017)]
The key thing is that no one’s been harmed.\c\nWe Gym Leaders worked together with the city’s\nPokémon, and we’ve got everyone evacuated.[VAR 0114(0017)]

G-Gym Challenger!\nYou must help me!\r\nI-I mean, please, help me![VAR 0114(0007)]
My Pokémon suddenly Dynamaxed for some\nreason and started running amok in\r\nthe stadium...[VAR 0114(0007)]
Raihan...I mean, Mr. Raihan was able to subdue\nthe Dynamax Pokémon in the stadium, but...[VAR 0114(0007)]

I know this is selfish of me, but I must beg\nyour assistance!\c\nI want you to head into the underground power\nplant and stop Mr. Rose![VAR 0114(0007)]
Mr. Rose has awakened a Pokémon known\nas Eternatus...\r\nApparently, the energy emitted from its body is\r\nwhat causes Dynamaxing.[VAR 0114(0007)]
At this rate, all the Pokémon in the Galar region\nwill Dynamax and go berserk!\c\nIf that were to happen—[VAR 0114(0007)]
Please, you must save Mr. Rose! You can take the\nlift over there to reach him.\c\nI’ve enlisted the help of the Champion’s younger\nbrother, too, but who knows what is going on...[VAR 0114(0007)]

Stopping the Darkest Day!
Helping the Champion
Uh, pardon?\nWhat are you talking about?\c\nThere’s nothing to stop now. We’ve already\nbrought about the Darkest Day...or should I say,\r\nthe ultimate Pokémon—Eternatus![VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m afraid I can’t allow that.\c\nThe Champion is the one who needs to\ncontrol Eternatus.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Must I explain myself?\c\nFrom your perspective, I suppose it must\nseem that I am doing something terrible.\r\nI don’t expect you to understand.\c\nBut I must provide the Galar region with limitless\nenergy to ensure everlasting prosperity.\c\nIt is my purpose, my duty, my destiny![VAR 0114(0006)]
That’s why we’ve been giving the Wishing Stars\nto Eternatus!\c\nSurely you remember the red light that caused a\nruckus around Hammerlocke. That was all part of\r\nour experiments to awaken Eternatus!\c\nYou must understand. I can’t let you interfere\nwith my plan to protect the future of Galar![VAR 0114(0006)]

I really do wish I could have seen the\nChampionship Match between you two.\c\nAnd I’m terribly sorry to have ruined the whole\nGym Challenge and everything![VAR 0114(0006)]
It’s too bad, but it can’t be helped...\c\nIn order to solve the energy issue as soon as\npossible, we awakened Eternatus. But we\r\ncouldn’t control it.\c\nThe Champion came to aid me, even at the cost\nof abandoning the match.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Indeed, just like a knight in shining armor coming\nto rescue a princess from a dragon![VAR 0114(0006)]
I do tend to ramble on, I know.\nI love to make speeches.\r\nBut I think I can stop talking now.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I think the Champion should have captured\nEternatus by now.\c\nIf you’re curious, you can take the lift up.[VAR 0114(0006)]
And I trust you’ll be going too, right, Hop?\nI certainly hope losing to me didn’t discourage\r\nyou too much.\c\nGo on now, both of you! Go see how our\nChampion is doing![VAR 0114(0006)]
Discouraged...?\nYou don’t get it, do you, Chairman?\c\nNeither me nor my Pokémon are anywhere near\ngiving up!\c\nWe’ve learned how to be strong, thanks to the\nGym Challenge you organized![VAR 0114(0005)]

Charizard and the rest of my champion team\nmembers have really worn Eternatus down.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Now if I can simply catch it in a Poké Ball,\nwe should be able to get this madness\r\nunder control.\r\nThen everything will be back to normal.\c\nSo watch this!\nIt’s going to be a real champion catch![VAR 0114(0004)]

Huh? [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]?!\nWhat’re you doing here in the woods?[VAR 0114(0005)]
What about you?
The truth is...
Nobody ever comes in here, since this is the\nforest where Zacian and Zamazenta rested.\c\nIt’s the best place to do a bit of thinking, since\nit’s so quiet and all.[VAR 0114(0005)]
You say you felt like something was calling you\nhere, [VAR 0100(0000)]? That’s...\r\nMate, that’s pretty uncanny.[VAR 0114(0005)]
You say you felt like something was calling you\nhere? That’s...\r\nMate, that’s pretty uncanny.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ve been thinking, you know...\nMaybe the reason Zacian and Zamazenta chose\r\na place like this to sleep was because no one\r\never comes here and it’s so quiet all the time.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, but I hadn’t had the chance to tell you!\nCongrats on your victory, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Honestly, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nI never thought you’d manage to beat my brother.\c\nThe greatest Champion Galar ever had!\nHe was undefeatable till you came around![VAR 0114(0005)]
It’s actually still pretty hard to believe...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Really... You’re amazing, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0005)]
So amazing, maybe, that I don’t even realize just\nhow amazing you really are![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 12]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], do you think...\c\nWould you be up for one more battle?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Sure!
Why?
Thanks, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nThen show me the strength that defeated Lee,\nthe greatest Champion we ever had![VAR 0114(0005)]
Because I want to feel for myself the strength\nthat defeated my brother, the greatest Champion\r\nwe’d ever had... Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m ready when you are, so just say the word![VAR 0114(0005)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_event_3010
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[~ 0]
This’ll be a serious battle!\nYou’re ready for that, aren’t you?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Of course!
Wait a minute...
So, the Champion thinks [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she can make me wait,\nis that it? Come on! Let’s have a battle![VAR 0114(0005)]
This is it![VAR 0114(0005)]
So, there really is no way I could ever beat you...\nI mean, you even beat my “unbeatable” brother![VAR 0114(0005)]
And if it isn’t the two of you again.\nI was wondering what all the noise was about.[VAR 0114(000B)]
And if it isn’t Sonia.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 9]
[~ 10]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]!\nCongratulations on beating Leon![VAR 0114(000B)]
Thank you
It was nothing...
Taking it all in stride like it’s your due, eh?\nYou cheeky thing![VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh, trying to act modest, are you?\nGo on—you’ve earned the right to be proud![VAR 0114(000B)]
What are you doing here?\nShouldn’t you be off assisting the professor?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hop, I’m actually not working as my gran’s\nassistant any longer...[VAR 0114(000B)]
In fact...\nI’m the professor now![VAR 0114(000B)]
Y-you are?![VAR 0114(0005)]
And really, I’ve got the two of you to thank\nfor that.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I was just along for the ride on your adventure,\nbut I ended up taking a real interest in the\r\nhistory of the Galar region.[VAR 0114(000B)]
And I came to care for Pokémon even more\nthan I ever had before![VAR 0114(000B)]
Ah, here! It’s a book I wrote!\nI even signed it—that makes it a collector’s item.[VAR 0114(000B)]
You received a copy of Sonia’s Book!
[~ 25]
[~ 26]
I’ve already got my own copy.\nLined up to buy it on the day it came out![VAR 0114(0005)]
Aww, thanks, Hop! That’s so sweet.\nI’ll sign your copy for you later.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Anyway, I’ve got my gran’s blessing and put out\nmy first book under my own name...\c\nI think you can expect great things of the lovely\nProfessor Sonia in the future, wouldn’t you say?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Yeah, I expect so...\nSonia and [VAR 0100(0000)], you both amaze me!\r\nI’ve got a lot to live up to here![VAR 0114(0005)]
So? What are you young’ns doing here?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Er, oh, right...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Ohhh... That’s it, isn’t it?\c\nYou were putting the Rusted Sword and the\nRusted Shield back in their place?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Can’t just keep holding on to them forever, right?[VAR 0114(000B)]
We...were! Yeah, that’s what we were doing!\nWe were just about to do that.[VAR 0114(0005)]
You forgot entirely, didn’t you?\c\nWhat, you think the two of you are besties now\nwith Zacian and Zamazenta or something?![VAR 0114(000B)]
That must be it, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nWhy you felt like you were called here![VAR 0114(0005)]
Let’s put the sword and the shield back and say\na proper thanks for all the help.\c\nMaybe if we do, we’ll get to see Zacian and\nZamazenta again someday.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I don’t have the best memories of the Slumbering\nWeald, but I came to do a quick investigation.\c\nHurry it up, and put the Rusted Sword and the\nRusted Shield back where they belong!\r\nI’d like to get a photo of them on location.[VAR 0114(000B)]

Return the [VAR 0109(0001)]?
Zacian! Zamazenta!\nThanks loads for helping us out![VAR 0114(0005)]
Took us a little while, but we’ve brought back\nyour precious relics and all![VAR 0114(0005)]
You and Hop returned the Rusted Sword and\nRusted Shield!
All right! That about settles that.\n[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], why don’t you and I head back?[VAR 0114(0005)]
What’re you gonna do, Sonia?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I think I’ll stay here a bit longer. I want to do a\nlittle more research here in the forest.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Hm? My Power Spot Detector is going off...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Well, well, well... I thought I heard someone making\nsome noise over this way![VAR 0114(0042)]
Well, well, well... You wouldn’t be the Professor\nSonia who wrote the book “Galar: A History”?[VAR 0114(0042)]
Eh, ah, hello... You bought my book?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Why yes, of course! Read it from cover to cover![VAR 0114(0042)]
Why yes, of course! I even wrote an internet\nreview for it![VAR 0114(0042)]
That awful book was filled with lies...\nSo we gave it one star![VAR 0114(006A)]
What?! There are no lies printed in that book![VAR 0114(000B)]
That’s just plain rude![VAR 0114(0005)]
I am Sordward![VAR 0114(0068)]
I am Shielbert![VAR 0114(0069)]
We are the new kings of Galar!\nWe’re descendants of the first kings![VAR 0114(0068)]
More than that, we’re celebrities![VAR 0114(0069)]
New kings? Descendants?\nSeriously, what are you on about?[VAR 0114(0005)]
What exactly are you two supposed to be?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Well, well, well! Could these things here be the\nfabled sword and shield?[VAR 0114(0068)]
Well, well, well! They certainly are dirty! They must\nbe fake! I fear to touch them with my bare hands.[VAR 0114(0069)]
Sordward took the Rusted Sword!
Shielbert took the Rusted Shield!
Hey! Don’t go nicking those!\nWe just returned them![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, do shut up! We only happened to pick up\nsome things that were dropped on the ground![VAR 0114(0068)]
If you’ve got a problem with it, how about you\nprove to whom they belong, hmm?[VAR 0114(0069)]
But...there’s no way anyone can prove who those\nancient things belong to!\c\nEven if we can’t prove it, they’re really important\nto Zacian and Zamazenta![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh goodness. Such a plebeian, and yet so pushy.\nIf it’s really so important to you, perhaps we\r\nshould settle this with a battle?[VAR 0114(0068)]
We’re celebrities who buy battles for twice what\nthey’re worth![VAR 0114(0069)]
What does that even mean...?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I, the magnificent Sordward, am your opponent![VAR 0114(0068)]
I, the magnificent Shielbert, am your opponent![VAR 0114(0069)]
You took back the [VAR 0109(0001)]!
Tch! To somehow have defeated the adorable\nPokémon I go strolling with...\c\nYou’re certainly strong...[VAR 0114(0068)]
Tch! To somehow have defeated the adorable\nPokémon I go strolling with...\c\nYou’re certainly strong...[VAR 0114(0069)]
However, it appears that my younger brother\nwas victorious.[VAR 0114(0068)]
However, it appears that my older brother\nwas victorious.[VAR 0114(0069)]
Sorry, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nI lost to him...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Wahahahah! Something on your mind, boy?\nYou weren’t concentrating at all during\r\nour battle![VAR 0114(0069)]
Wahahahah! Something on your mind, boy?\nYou weren’t concentrating at all during\r\nour battle![VAR 0114(0068)]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Older Brother! Isn’t that the one who\nstopped Eternatus?[VAR 0114(0069)]
Younger Brother! Isn’t that the one who\nstopped Eternatus?[VAR 0114(0068)]
Oho! Now that I look closely, I believe it is!\c\nWhat a rude child, snatching up our chance at\nglory like that.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Oho! Now that I look closely, I believe it is!\c\nWhat a rude child, snatching up our chance at\nglory like that.[VAR 0114(0069)]
According to our sources...\c\nI believe [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she was also present during the\ndestruction of the magnificent mural our\r\nancestor so artfully created many years ago.[VAR 0114(0069)]
According to our sources...\c\nI believe [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she was also present during the\ndestruction of the magnificent mural our\r\nancestor so artfully created many years ago.[VAR 0114(0068)]
What a garish brute! Destroying the mural our\nfamily has held in such high esteem for so long?![VAR 0114(0068)]
What a garish brute! Destroying the mural our\nfamily has held in such high esteem for so long?![VAR 0114(0069)]
Mural? You mean the one that hid the historical\nruins of [VAR 0101(0001)] and the others?\c\nAnd hold on a moment—[VAR 0100(0000)] wasn’t\nthe one who destroyed it.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Let us withdraw for now... Next time we shall\nbring Pokémon that will utterly defeat you![VAR 0114(0069)]
Let us withdraw for now... Next time we shall\nbring Pokémon that will utterly defeat you![VAR 0114(0068)]
That’s right![VAR 0114(0068)]
Yes, let’s do that![VAR 0114(0069)]
And with that, farewell![VAR 0114(006A)]
W-wait! Stop!\nGive back that [VAR 0109(0001)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hold on, Hop![VAR 0114(000B)]
Ugh, that kid. He’s gone and recklessly run off...[VAR 0114(000B)]
At least you’re calm, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nI expected as much.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m surprised that Hop lost to someone like that.\c\nHe looked upset about something during the\nbattle. Maybe that had something to do with it?[VAR 0114(000B)]
His own rival became the new Champion, and his\ngoal vanished before his eyes...\c\nYou can’t help but wonder how he feels about\nit all.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Anyway! Sordward and Shielbert, was it? I think I\nmight know something about where those two\r\nweirdos went...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Shall we go over it at the lab in Wedgehurst?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Of course!
I’m worried about Hop
I bet I didn’t even need to ask! Thanks![VAR 0114(000B)]
I get it... You feel responsible for him and want\nto help him as soon as you can, right?[VAR 0114(000B)]
OK, we’ll meet up later, then! I’ll head back to\nthe lab.[VAR 0114(000B)]

Text File : main_event_3040

Hm?
Professor Sonia, you have a visitor.
Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Glad you’re here.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Who’s this?
You got an assistant?
She’s my assistant! I’ve been so busy with\nresearch lately that I’ve had to bring on some\r\nextra help.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Spot on! I’ve been busy with my research, so I\ndecided to bring on some extra help.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ve been keeping all the Wishing Stars that\nChairman Rose had been gathering here in\r\nthe lab.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Things have been a little hectic around here, but\nmy assistant has been handling things in a proper\r\nfashion. She’s really been helping me keep\r\nthings afloat.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I really haven’t been doing all that much...
You’re [VAR 0100(0000)], the Champion, right?\c\nI’m really glad I get to meet you. It’s an\nhonor, truly.
Come here for a moment, would you? There’s\nsomething I want you to have a look at.[VAR 0114(000B)]
You remember my Power Spot Detector, right?\nIt detects places where Dynamaxing is possible...\c\nBasically when there’s a high concentration of\nGalar particles, the readings spike...[VAR 0114(000B)]
And that’s how I figured it out![VAR 0114(000B)]
The Power Spot Detector reacted when those\ntwo got close.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Could it be...?
So what does that mean?
Exactly![VAR 0114(000B)]
Basically...[VAR 0114(000B)]
follow the readings from the Power Spot\nDetector, and you might be able to find those\r\nsword and shield weirdos.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Sordward and Shielbert might claim to be royalty,\nwith their weird, fancy names. But it’s easier to\r\njust call them weirdos, don’t you think?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Let’s get back on topic, though![VAR 0114(000B)]
I placed Power Spot Detectors all around Galar,\nand now it’s their time to shine.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Power Spot Detectors—access![VAR 0114(000B)]
Whoa, whoa! That’s a way bigger reaction than I\nwould’ve thought! Looks like it’s coming from...\c\nTurffield Stadium?[VAR 0114(000B)]
You could always Dynamax Pokémon at the\nstadium, so that’s not exactly unusual.\r\nBut these readings are way higher than normal![VAR 0114(000B)]
It can’t be Eternatus... You already caught it.\nMaybe it’s something related to those sword and\r\nshield weirdos?[VAR 0114(000B)]
You should go check it out, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nSince you’re our snazzy new Champion and all![VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ve set up your Town Map to show where the\nstrong particle reactions are coming from, so\r\nhave a look at it.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ll leave looking into Turffield to you. I’ll stay\nhere and try to look into those rude weirdos.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m so glad to be working for Professor Sonia.\nTo have a doctorate at such a young age...\r\nShe’s really an amazing person.

Hm? You’re...[VAR 0114(0016)]
Hello there, Champion!\nSo, you came![VAR 0114(000E)]
What’s going on here?
It’s been a while
Hah! How carefree can you be?\c\nYou’re the new Champion. You’re bigger than a\nDynamax Pokémon right now.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I was actually in the middle of an exhibition\nmatch with Piers.\c\nThen this Dynamax Pokémon came charging in.[VAR 0114(000E)]
The audience and staff already took shelter.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Gyaaan!
I got everyone who was seated on the north side\nof the stadium evacuated!\c\nYou must’ve heard, right?\nMore Dynamax Pokémon are running amok![VAR 0114(0005)]
Much obliged, Hop!\c\nI’d expect nothing less from a Gym Challenger.\nI knew we could count on you.[VAR 0114(000E)]
I lost in the Semifinals, though...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Ah, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
I chased those red and blue guys and saw them\nhead into Turffield Stadium.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Then I heard that uproar, and there was no way\nI could leave it alone. I had to help out.[VAR 0114(0005)]
So, er... Sorry!\nI actually lost sight of them in all the rush.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hm. Those suspicious characters you saw\nare concerning...[VAR 0114(000E)]
But for now, I think we should get this Dynamax\nPokémon to settle down first![VAR 0114(000E)]
I’d be glad for your help against such a tough-\nlooking opponent, Champion [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000E)]
Of course!
Hold on a sec
All right. Then let’s head to the pitch.[VAR 0114(000E)]
I’ll lend a hand, too.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I don’t blame the Pokémon, of course, but I’m\nstill just a bit miffed they upstaged me.[VAR 0114(0016)]
You come too, bro of the old Champion.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I don’t know how much I can really help...[VAR 0114(0005)]
If I come along, I might just end up slowing the\nrest of you down...[VAR 0114(0005)]
I don’t really know the guy, but I don’t think\nLeon’d be all lost about this.\r\nThough he does get actually lost a lot...[VAR 0114(0016)]
You comin’?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Uh... OK![VAR 0114(0005)]
Piers might look scary, but he’s great at looking\nafter others. He’s a big brother, after all.[VAR 0114(000E)]
All right, we should get going, too.[VAR 0114(000E)]
OK! Preparation is as important as laying\nseeds for the next harvest.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Are you ready to battle the Dynamax Pokémon?[VAR 0114(000E)]
Usin’ Pokémon to ruin this stage...\nThe Trainers that did this ain’t gettin’ off\r\neasy if I find ’em.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I wonder if there’s anything more I can do?[VAR 0114(0005)]

Mugyuuu.
Milo used a Revive!
Shaaanari.
Phew... Looks like things’ve finally calmed down\na bit.[VAR 0114(000E)]
This Dynamax stuff... No matter how many times\nI see it, I still don’t like it.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I can see your dislike of Dynamaxing still hasn’t\nchanged, Piers.[VAR 0114(000E)]
But there was definitely something off about\nthat Dynamax transformation...[VAR 0114(000E)]
There wasn’t any Trainer anywhere!\c\nAnd the Pokémon seemed like it couldn’t even\ncontrol the power itself...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Quite right...\c\nNormally, a Pokémon needs to respond to a\nDynamax Band in order to Dynamax, but...[VAR 0114(000E)]
Seems there was some discord in the harmony\nbetween Trainer and Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Did you feel anything unusual, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000E)]
I did
I’m not sure
So you noticed something was off, too.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Hmm, well, I suppose it is a bit early to start\ndrawing any conclusions.[VAR 0114(000E)]
There’s no Trainer to be found. This really is a\nmystery wrapped in an enigma.[VAR 0114(000E)]
I’ll make sure Turffield Gym takes good care of\nthis Pokémon for the time being.[VAR 0114(000E)]
[~ 24]
You lot really helped me out here. Thanks\nfor that.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Oh, and [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nIf you should ever need my help, feel free to\ncall me anytime.[VAR 0114(000E)]
All right then. Follow me, little Tsareena.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Shaaanari.
Well, well, well! Looks like that Dynamax\nnonsense has calmed down.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Well, well, well. The Champion, as expected.[VAR 0114(0069)]
Ah! It’s you two! I knew you’d be here!\nGive the [VAR 0109(0001)] back![VAR 0114(0005)]
Well, I never. It’s not like it’s something that\nbelongs to you, either.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Even if it were yours, we wouldn’t give it back.[VAR 0114(0069)]
What’s with these two! Arrrghhh!\nGet over here so I can battle you![VAR 0114(0005)]
Who are these guys?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Spectators and staff should’ve been evacuated.[VAR 0114(0016)]
The normal rules simply just don’t apply to us![VAR 0114(0068)]
Yes! That’s what it means to be celebrities![VAR 0114(0069)]
What?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Who is this ruffian to question us? You’re just\nsomeone with strange taste in hairstyles![VAR 0114(0068)]
His entire style is complete black and white\nnonsense. Isn’t it, Older Brother?[VAR 0114(0069)]
You think I’d put any faith in words from rude\nlittle punks like you?[VAR 0114(0016)]
But it seems our experiment was a success,\nYounger Brother.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Quite, quite. Next time let us try to Dynamax\nan even stronger Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0069)]
Yes, yes! At last we shall reveal the true nature of\nZacian and Zamazenta![VAR 0114(0068)]
What was that about Zacian and Zamazenta?![VAR 0114(0005)]
You, despicable Champion! We’re going to keep\nletting Dynamax Pokémon run wild![VAR 0114(0069)]
If you want to stop us, do your best to chase\nafter our splendid-looking bottoms![VAR 0114(0068)]
More like...celebrity bottoms![VAR 0114(0069)]
And with that, farewell![VAR 0114(006A)]
So you were the ones who caused all this? Stop![VAR 0114(0005)]
Calm down, Hop. You don’t gotta act so hard.[VAR 0114(0016)]
B-but they’re getting away![VAR 0114(0005)]
Yeah, and they could be leadin’ us to a trap.\nIt’s a bad idea to run in unprepared.[VAR 0114(0016)]
But still![VAR 0114(0005)]
Ughhh... Fine.\nYou’re right. I get it.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Good. Let’s all calm down for a sec.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Thanks to them runnin’ their mouths, we know\ntheir goal is to force Pokémon to Dynamax.[VAR 0114(0016)]
And that they plan to continue doing it![VAR 0114(0005)]
I won’t allow it!
We have to stop them!
Yeah![VAR 0114(0005)]
This is no time to be hung up on getting back\nthe [VAR 0109(0001)]...\c\n[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! Piers!\nWe’ve got to stop those two![VAR 0114(0005)]
How’re those two makin’ Pokémon Dynamax\nwithout any Dynamax Bands?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Where would those red and blue buffoons have\ngone off to next?\c\nLet’s head out and look, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]

Ah, there you are, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Things are a\nright proper mess![VAR 0114(000B)]
Just when I thought the Galar particle count\naround Turffield had calmed down...[VAR 0114(000B)]
I started getting huge Galar particle readings\nfrom Hulbury Stadium and Motostoke Stadium![VAR 0114(000B)]
So, what exactly happened at Turffield Stadium?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Explain exactly what happened
Exaggerate what happened
What?! A Dynamax Pokémon went on\na rampage?[VAR 0114(000B)]
What?! A Dynamax Pokémon completely\ndestroyed the stadium?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Wait... Turffield Stadium is still there.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Huh? Those sword and shield weirdos did it?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh! Sonia![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hm? Hop and...Piers?![VAR 0114(000B)]
Piers, what are you doing here? Shouldn’t you be\nback in Spikemuth?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m an ex-Gym Leader. I can be wherever I want.\nIt’s not that weird![VAR 0114(0016)]
More importantly, you said there were Dynamax\nPokémon at other stadiums?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Yes. I’m getting the same readings in other towns\nas I was from Turffield Stadium.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m worried about Marnie![VAR 0114(0016)]
Ah, but Spikemuth Gym should be OK, right?\nI’m only seeing readings from Hulbury Stadium\r\nand Motostoke Stadium.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Ah... I see.[VAR 0114(0016)]
If Pokémon are being forced to Dynamax and\nrunning wild, there’s no way I can simply sit\r\nby and watch![VAR 0114(0005)]
What do you say, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Let’s head to one of the stadiums!
I want to chase after those two weirdos!
Heh. That’s the spirit, Champion.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Even if we wanna go after them, we don’t know\nwhere they went...[VAR 0114(0016)]
Leave those sword and shield weirdos to me.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I can poke around the net for sightings of them![VAR 0114(000B)]
We’ll leave the researchin’ to this, er... Sonia,\nwas it? We should get to the other stadiums\r\nand help out.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I’ll catch up to you in a bit, so head out first. I’ll\nleave it up to you to decide which stadium we\r\nhandle first.[VAR 0114(0016)]
If someone’s in trouble, then I want to help!\c\nSo, let’s get out there and do our best.\nAll right, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Those sword and shield weirdos stick out like a\nsore thumb. It shouldn’t be too hard to find them.\r\nTime for a little searching on social media![VAR 0114(000B)]

Don’t get too close, you lot! Things are pretty\ndangerous here![VAR 0114(000F)]
We know the situation. Are the staff and\nspectators all right?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Yes. They took shelter just a short while ago...[VAR 0114(000F)]
Y’know, the more I look at you three, the more I\nsee how odd a little group you are.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Tch. Leave us alone.[VAR 0114(0016)]
We came here to help you out.[VAR 0114(0005)]
And I’m grateful for it. That Dynamax Pokémon’s\npower is so intense I’m sure it’d give me trouble.[VAR 0114(000F)]
I’d feel a lot more confident about it if you all\njoined the battle.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Let’s do it![VAR 0114(000F)]
[~ 9]
[~ 10]
[~ 11]
Because of everyone’s help, no one was hurt and\nwe were able to turn the tide of the situation.[VAR 0114(000F)]
I’ll keep that Pokémon at Hulbury Stadium until\nit can fully recover.[VAR 0114(000F)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]... If you ever need my help, just\nlet me know.[VAR 0114(000F)]
I suppose I’ll see you later, then? Thank you so\nmuch for your help, truly.[VAR 0114(000F)]

Champion [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nAnd Piers and Hop, too![VAR 0114(0010)]
Mr. Kabu! I’m glad you remember me.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Of course I do!\c\nYou two were red-hot, after all! I’ll never\nforget seeing you off after you’d completed\r\nyour first leg of the Gym Challenge.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Oi, can we save the nostalgia for later?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Don’t think we really got the time for a\nfriendly chin-wag.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Right! Actually...the situation’s getting pretty\nbad over at the stadium.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Yeah. That’d be why we’re here.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Ah, brilliant! The opponent’s a bit much to\ntake on single-handedly, so I was wondering\r\nwhat to do.[VAR 0114(0010)]
But with you all at my side, my confidence in this\nbattle is burning brighter by the minute![VAR 0114(0010)]
Let’s begin![VAR 0114(0010)]
[~ 10]
[~ 11]
[~ 12]
Looks like we were able to extinguish things\nthis time.[VAR 0114(0010)]
I’ll let this Pokémon rest here at Motostoke\nStadium until it gets its energy back.[VAR 0114(0010)]
And, [VAR 0100(0000)], should you have need of\nmy help, please do not hesitate to ask.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Don’t worry—I know... You all have more work\nthat needs to be done, yes?[VAR 0114(0010)]
Go forward, youths! I wish you well![VAR 0114(0010)]

What?! Sonia, you all right?![VAR 0114(0005)]
They keep rudely demanding I hand over\nWishing Stars. I’m all right for now, but get over\r\nhere quick, OK? These guys are right creepy![VAR 0114(000B)]

What’re those two doin’ goin’ after\nWishing Stars?[VAR 0114(0016)]
We’ve got to help Sonia and get back\nthe [VAR 0109(0001)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Let’s hurry to the Pokémon Lab![VAR 0114(0005)]
He really doesn’t think anythin’ through...\nSure does make him seem a proper fool.\r\nNah, guess the word would be “reckless.”[VAR 0114(0016)]

We know all the Wishing Stars that Chairman\nRose had gathered are here. We celebrities have\r\nan enhanced level of insight into such things![VAR 0114(0068)]
You noncelebrities are not suited to having\nsuch valuable things. Hand them over to us.[VAR 0114(0069)]
Wishing Stars and being a celebrity have nothing\nto do with each other![VAR 0114(000B)]
I don’t know how you knew about this, but\nthere’s no way we’re giving them to you![VAR 0114(000B)]
That’s right! You could never understand how\nimportant these Wishing Stars are. You have\r\nno need for them![VAR 0114(000A)]
Goodness. Whatever should we do,\nYounger Brother?[VAR 0114(0068)]
It would certainly seem we have been\ninconvenienced, Older Brother.[VAR 0114(0069)]
Wahahahah!
Sonia and the professor are the ones who’ve\nbeen inconvenienced here![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hop![VAR 0114(000B)]
Forcing Pokémon to Dynamax against their will...\nYou’ve gone way out of bounds here![VAR 0114(0005)]
And I haven’t forgot about getting back the\n[VAR 0109(0001)], either![VAR 0114(0005)]
Well, well, well! I certainly thought the Champion\nwould come, but I didn’t think a loser\r\nwould follow.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Must I have you once again taste the flavor of a\nhumiliating defeat?[VAR 0114(0069)]
Rrrghhh![VAR 0114(0005)]
Don’t let these goons put you down![VAR 0114(000B)]
That’s right![VAR 0114(0016)]
You lost a battle, but don’t lose that rockin’ spirit![VAR 0114(0016)]
R-right...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Steady on
We’ll fight them together
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]...\nThanks, mate![VAR 0114(0005)]
First thing’s first!\nLet’s get these weirdos out of here![VAR 0114(0005)]
W— W-w-w...\nW-w-w...WEIRDOS?[VAR 0114(0068)]
Oh, how they wound me, Older Brother!\nTo be called so terrible a thing as “weirdos” by\r\nthese ruffians![VAR 0114(0069)]
Indeed! To address royals such as ourselves in\nsuch a manner cannot—will not—be forgiven![VAR 0114(0068)]
This time I’ve brought much stronger Pokémon to\nthoroughly trounce you with![VAR 0114(0069)]
I did it...\nWe won! We really won![VAR 0114(0005)]
The exquisite Pokémon we trained actually lost?![VAR 0114(0068)]
Harumph! You only won because you two teamed\nup. Still, we offer you ruffians our praise.[VAR 0114(0069)]
Oi. The two of you teamed up, too.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Give back the [VAR 0109(0001)], and\nstop forcing Pokémon to go all crazy![VAR 0114(0005)]
Ah, sorry... Is this a bad time?
My apologies for the intrusion.
Those men are dangerous! Be careful![VAR 0114(000B)]
... ... ...
Well done. Your infiltration mission was a\nresounding success, it seems.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Have you gathered the Wishing Stars?[VAR 0114(0069)]
Yes, thanks to Masters Sordward and Shielbert\nbuying me so much time.
The assistant handed the Wishing Stars over to\nSordward and Shielbert!
What? Stop! Give back those Wishing Stars![VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh dear... It would seem we’ve been\ncompletely had.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Fwaheeheehoho! Why, this moment is so sweet,\nI don’t think I’ll need any sugar in my tea later![VAR 0114(0068)]
Our battle with you was just a little trick! We’d\nwon before you’d grabbed a single Poké Ball![VAR 0114(0069)]
And with that, farewell!
Stop![VAR 0114(0005)]
Why?![VAR 0114(000B)]
Professor Sonia...I’m sorry.
Was everything... Was it all a lie, right from\nthe start?[VAR 0114(000B)]
There was no helping it. It was necessary for\nthe plan.
Our plan to put Galar under the control of the\nroyal lineage once again...
... ... ...[VAR 0114(000B)]
I think she’s gonna need some cheerin’ from her\nreal friends.[VAR 0114(0016)]
So those two weren’t working alone?\c\nOne of their followers even betrayed Sonia...\nThat’s real rough...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Seems that lot did have something to back up all\ntheir big talk...[VAR 0114(000A)]

Wait! Don’t just leave without saying anything![VAR 0114(000B)]
But...you were upset.\nWe didn’t want to say anything to make it worse.[VAR 0114(0005)]
We were tryin’ to be considerate, but...[VAR 0114(0016)]
Of course I’d be down on myself! It was my fault\nI got tricked by a Nickit in Wooloo’s clothing.[VAR 0114(000B)]
But that’s it! No more feeling sorry for myself![VAR 0114(000B)]
That lot made off like bandits with all the\nWishing Stars![VAR 0114(000B)]
It’d be awful if they were used for some evil\npurpose, so there’s no time to be feeling down![VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh![VAR 0114(0005)]
Heh. Hehehe... You’ve got some guts.[VAR 0114(0016)]
You’ve certainly grown strong in the face of\nadversity, dearie.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Gran...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Dynamaxing draws out the true strength from the\ntrust between a Pokémon and their Trainer.[VAR 0114(000A)]
But that group is likely pouring the Galar\nparticles emitted by the Wishing Stars into\r\nPokémon, forcing them to Dynamax.[VAR 0114(000A)]
That’s awful!
That would explain the theft...
Indeed. What an awful thing to do to Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0016)]
As expected of the Champion. Your intuition is\nquite sharp, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000A)]
The theft of the Wishing Stars was just the start.\nThings could get a lot worse from here on.[VAR 0114(000A)]
But why? What reason could they have for\nforcing Pokémon to Dynamax?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Those weirdos said that they wanted to reveal\nthe true natures of Zacian and Zamazenta.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m curious about what my former assistant said\nabout a royal lineage.\c\nDid she mean it literally?[VAR 0114(000B)]
...Ah! [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! Look at your Town Map![VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m detecting huge reactions at four\nstadiums now![VAR 0114(000B)]
They certainly get around, don’t they?[VAR 0114(000A)]
If there’s trouble at the stadiums, then Marnie\ncould be in a real bad way![VAR 0114(0016)]
Ah, Spikemuth seems to be OK. There’s no\nPower Spot stadium there...[VAR 0114(000B)]
*ahem*\nRighto...[VAR 0114(0016)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]!\nThis is no time to be lying about![VAR 0114(0005)]
If Pokémon are in trouble, why’re we still here?!\nLet’s get right out there to lend a hand![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m sorry to leave it all to you, but you’ll have to\ntake care of the Dynamax Pokémon.\c\nI’ll search for those sword and shield weirdos in\nthe meantime![VAR 0114(000B)]
Wishing Stars were one component of the\nDarkest Day...\c\nIf they have that many, they could cause\nPokémon to Dynamax like Eternatus did.[VAR 0114(000A)]

Nice timing, you lot![VAR 0114(0017)]
The stadium’s just about reached its limit!\c\nThere’re simply too many Dynamax Pokémon\nrunning wild in there![VAR 0114(0017)]
Seems Wishing Star power is bein’ used for\nsome evil purpose.[VAR 0114(0016)]
So that’s what’s caused all this?\nThat’s a problem, all right...\c\nBut before we get that sorted, we’ve got to do\nsomething about these Dynamax Pokémon![VAR 0114(0017)]
Glad we’ve got you all here now.\nThough we’ve already done the bulk of the work![VAR 0114(0017)]
We’re here to help, too!\nRight, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Leave it to us!
We’ll take care of this!
Especially you, Piers!\nThe way you battled me in the Champion Cup...\c\nYou really had my Dynamax Pokémon up against\nthe wall![VAR 0114(0017)]
Things might actually go better this time if we\nsplit up our little band.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Fantastic! Looks like we’ve got ourselves together\nan unbeatable team![VAR 0114(0017)]
Right! Everyone, split up so we can each take\ndown one of the Dynamax Pokémon! Let’s do it![VAR 0114(0017)]

You guys are the greatest!\nYou really got me out of a tough spot here!\c\nI think I’d better snap a quick one to remember\nthis victory by.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I’ll take care of the Pokémon that went wild.\nNo need for you all to worry about that.[VAR 0114(0017)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]!\nGive me a ring if things should go to pot again.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I’m always happy to lend a hand if I can.\nThe great Raihan is here for you anytime![VAR 0114(0017)]
And Piers! You and I have got to battle again.\nThis time, no Dynamaxing for either of us![VAR 0114(0017)]
Wishing Stars being used for evil...\c\nI assume you all are already looking into who’s\nbehind it, right?\c\nCarry on, then. I’ll take care of things here at\nHammerlocke Stadium![VAR 0114(0017)]

...Oh. You.\nYou came to help me?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Eh, somethin’ like that. How’re things lookin’?[VAR 0114(0016)]
We just finished getting everyone to safety, so\nI was about to challenge the Dynamax Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0011)]
The people all got out...\c\nBut I’m the Gym Leader...\nI’ll...battle the Dynamax Pokémon![VAR 0114(0012)]

Nice one! Then let’s all work together![VAR 0114(0005)]
I give you my most heartfelt thanks![VAR 0114(0011)]
That’d...\nThat’d be brilliant, thanks![VAR 0114(0012)]
We’ve got several opponents, so we may as well\ntake one each.\c\nI’ll be counting on you all![VAR 0114(0011)]
There are loads of ’em...\nI hope everyone...can take one each. Please![VAR 0114(0012)]

I can’t thank you all enough.\c\nWith your help, the Dynamax Pokémon have all\nbeen returned to normal.[VAR 0114(0011)]
...Th-thanks. A lot.\c\nThe Pokémon have all calmed down...[VAR 0114(0012)]
I’ll keep them safe here in the stadium, so no\nneed to worry.[VAR 0114(0011)]
They can rest here...\nThey...should be fine in time...[VAR 0114(0012)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nNext time I’ll be the one who saves you in your\nhour of need. Give me a call if you’re ever in a\r\nrough spot.[VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]...\nHere... My League Card.[VAR 0114(0012)]
If there are other places that need a Champion’s\nhelp, please go look after them![VAR 0114(0011)]
...Y-you can leave things here to me.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I’ll protect the peace of Stow-on-Side Stadium\nwith all my might![VAR 0114(0011)]

Hmph. You lot.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Bede?! What about the Dynamax Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0005)]
You think I, the elite Fairy-type Gym Leader,\nwould have any kind of trouble?[VAR 0114(000C)]
That’s right—you’re a Gym Leader now!\nThough I don’t know about “elite” or whatever.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Please...please don’t tell me you came\nhere to help?\c\nFirst of all, you’re a bit late to be of any use,\nand second, I didn’t need any help.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Why’d I know you’d say something like that...?\nWe came all the way out here just to lend a hand![VAR 0114(0005)]
What an obnoxious Gym Leader. The next Gym\nChallenge is shapin’ up to really be somethin’.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Oleana tricked and used me...\nFrom now on, only I decide how I live![VAR 0114(000C)]
And I think what I should do now is have a battle\nwith you, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000C)]
Look, I’m sorry, mate, but...\nthis is hardly the time![VAR 0114(0005)]
Don’t always be in such a hurry, boy.\nYou aced my quiz, so show a little composure.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Bede has already quieted three Dynamax Pokémon.\nHe’s given you the luxury of some extra time.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Bede’s life won’t be bound by what other people\nsay any longer.\c\nAlthough I certainly influenced a few of his\ndecisions not too long ago.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Now that you mention it...I suppose you did.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Yeah, yeah. As expected of a wise 88-year-old\ngranny, I guess.[VAR 0114(0016)]
But this has nothing to do with Ms. Opal.\nThis battle’s for me!\c\nNow, don’t dillydally!\nYour only option is to accept![VAR 0114(000C)]
I’ll battle you
I understand!
My Pokémon and I have risen from the ashes...\nI’ll grant you a brief glimpse at how amazing\r\nwe’ve become.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Thank you for the battle.\c\nI can now accept you as the Champion.[VAR 0114(000C)]
It’s painful to admit, but I’ve come to realize a\nfew of my weaknesses.[VAR 0114(000C)]
But I’ll keep getting stronger. I’ll reach the\npinnacle of what Fairy types can do.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Now then, as the Gym Leader, I will do my duty\nand clean the stadium.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Now, that’s what I would call a perfectly pink\nPokémon battle![VAR 0114(0013)]
Even after losing his right to participate in the\nGym Challenge, Bede still found his own way to\r\ncrash the Champion Cup...\c\nYeah, I’d say he’s a force to be reckoned with.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I think I get why he was chosen to be the next\nGym Leader.[VAR 0114(0005)]
He might be unbearable at times—or really, most\nall the time—but he’s a fierce Trainer.[VAR 0114(0005)]
He takes things seriously
He’s really strong
Yeah. Watching him battle you, it was plain to\nsee how much work he puts into it.[VAR 0114(0005)]
He’s strong enough that even a Champion like\nyou recognizes it, eh?[VAR 0114(0005)]
If you both are gonna keep talkin’, how ’bout I\nfetch you a nice cuppa?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Right, right, I hear you!\nAnd I won’t be outdone by that Bede or anyone!\r\nOn to the next one![VAR 0114(0005)]

Oh, actually...\nI didn’t realize who I was talking to.[VAR 0114(0014)]

I was just thinking over how to handle all the\nDynamax Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0014)]
There appear to be no less than four Dynamax\nPokémon. I was just going over a plan on how\r\nto handle things.[VAR 0114(0015)]
With all of you here, we can each take one of\nthem on![VAR 0114(0014)]
With all these strong Trainers together, I’m sure\nwe can work something out here![VAR 0114(0015)]

Phew! Is everyone feeling all right?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Hah...hah... Just barely![VAR 0114(0005)]
Battling a Dynamax Pokémon all on your own is\npretty hard work![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hehe. I expected nothing less from you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]. You seem like quite the\r\nreliable Trainer, too, Hop.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Ohoho! Of course you had no problem,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]! You really seem like a reliable\r\nTrainer, too, Hop![VAR 0114(0015)]

Looks like he ain’t used to compliments. Look,\nhe’s got a grin wider than a Meowth.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I do not!\nShut your gob, Piers![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll take care of the Pokémon we battled, so\nthere’s no need for any of you to worry, all right?[VAR 0114(0014)]
I’ll take care of the Pokémon we battled.\nNo need for anyone to worry.[VAR 0114(0015)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]. It’s hardly a reward for what\nyou’ve done for me, but please take a copy of\r\nmy League Card.[VAR 0114(0014)]

So the reason those red and blue buffoons\ncould make so many Pokémon Dynamax was\r\nbecause they hoarded up so many Wishing Stars...[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nWe’ve got to go help all the other places where\nthese Dynamax Pokémon are running wild![VAR 0114(0005)]
Looks like most of the stadiums have got this\nDynamax problem sorted now.\c\nLet’s keep up the pace, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]

Things’ll probably get even tougher from here.\nWe still got three more stadiums where there’s\r\nsome Dynamax Pokémon runnin’ wild.\c\nLet’s up the tempo.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Looks like there’s two Pokémon Stadiums left\nto check.[VAR 0114(0016)]
There’s only one Pokémon Stadium with\nDynamax trouble left. Let’s finish this already.[VAR 0114(0016)]
All that’s left is to catch those sword and\nshield weirdos.[VAR 0114(0016)]
If we don’t find them quick, they could just start\nall this up again![VAR 0114(0005)]
Wasn’t Professor Sonia s’pposed to be\nlookin’ into where those two might be?[VAR 0114(0016)]
And once we find them again, I’m going to take\nthem right down![VAR 0114(0005)]

Heh! Called it.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Those sword and shield weirdos got into\nHammerlocke Stadium and are headed\r\nfor the Energy Plant.[VAR 0114(000B)]
The door to the plant’s locked, but I think I can\nget it open. Give me a bit, and you’ll be able to\r\nget in there![VAR 0114(000B)]
You hear that? Hammerlocke Stadium. Get over\nthere as soon as you can![VAR 0114(000B)]
Even over the phone, Sonia sure sounds lively...[VAR 0114(0005)]
We should hurry to Hammerlocke Stadium.[VAR 0114(0016)]

But the door’s closed with an electric lock.\nOpening it might take some time...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Bow wark!
I’ll work on getting the door to the roof open.\nCan you take care of what’s going on in the\r\nstadiums, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Wha—? You’re back already? Hold on a moment!\nI think I’ve almost got it... Huh? That’s strange...[VAR 0114(000B)]

I still don’t quite see anything like that in\nmyself yet...[VAR 0114(0005)]
But thanks to your help, I’m starting to![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! I’ve got a favor to ask![VAR 0114(0005)]
Though I hate to look like I’m copying that posh\njerk, Bede...\c\nStill! I want another battle against you![VAR 0114(0005)]
Everything started right here...[VAR 0114(0005)]
in the Slumbering Weald![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hop sure must be tough if he’s been accepted\nby [VAR 0101(0001)].\c\nMake sure you’re in top form before\nchallenging him.[VAR 0114(000B)]
If you need some time to prepare, I can take you\nback to the entrance of the woods.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Want me to show you to the center of the\nwoods, where Hop is waiting?[VAR 0114(000B)]

That’s our greatest Champion for you...\nYou really are strong, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
But getting beat this time felt a bit different.\nI may’ve lost, but I feel great![VAR 0114(0005)]
You know what, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nI think I’ve found a dream of my own![VAR 0114(0005)]
I want to be someone who can help out Pokémon\nthat’re in trouble, wherever they are...\r\nI think I want to become a Pokémon Professor![VAR 0114(0005)]
I started thinking I might when we were going\naround to all the stadiums to help the Pokémon\r\nthat were running out of control.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I know I don’t know enough about Pokémon yet,\nand I’ve got no experience for this sort of thing,\r\nbut I’m gonna study and learn a whole lot![VAR 0114(0005)]
And someday I’ll become the sort of professor\nthat you, [VAR 0100(0000)], and you, Sonia...\r\nwell, the sort you would be proud to know![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m gonna take a different path than you and\nLee are taking, [VAR 0100(0000)]...but...\r\nI’ll still always think of you as my true rival![VAR 0114(0005)]
There’s nothing I’d like better!
I still don’t plan on losing to you!
Same here.\nWe’ll always be rivals, you and me![VAR 0114(0005)]
Not like I plan on losing to you, either!\nEven if our goals are different now...\r\nwe’ll always be proper rivals, you and me![VAR 0114(0005)]
Ahhh! No fair. You two are so young and cute.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m tearing up.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Sonia!\nGetting a bit weepy in your old age, eh?[VAR 0114(0005)]
What?! I’m still young and super energetic![VAR 0114(000B)]
Say, Hop. Fancy becoming my assistant at\nthe lab?[VAR 0114(000B)]
What?![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ve got all the books and data on Pokémon you\ncould ever want![VAR 0114(000B)]
Since you want to be a professor someday, I’ll\noversee your studies![VAR 0114(000B)]
Then I definitely want to!\nOnly...you sure I can really be any help to you?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Of course! Mind you, it’ll be a lot of work.\nWork’s really been piling up since I lost my\r\nfirst assistant![VAR 0114(000B)]
Wait! So what you really mean is you’re offering\nme the position to help yourself out?\r\nAh, fine! I’ll still do a bang-up job![VAR 0114(0005)]
You’ll have my back, too—right, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, and...here, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nYou should take this![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 0101(0001)] and I, well...\nWe’re gonna do our best together to work toward\r\nachieving that dream.\c\nSo until we do...you keep it, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
*clap clap clap*
Well, well, well now! That certainly was a\nsplendid battle and a refreshing back and forth,\r\neh wot?[VAR 0114(0068)]
Well, well, well now... That really touched my heart![VAR 0114(0069)]
Huh?! Sordward and Shielbert...with Piers?\nAnd even Lee?![VAR 0114(0005)]
What’re you lot doing here?[VAR 0114(000B)]
No need for the noisemakery, young lady.[VAR 0114(0068)]
We have come to meet with the young\nM[VAR 1100(00FF,0205)]asters. [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0069)]
They didn’t get the chance to properly\napologize yet.[VAR 0114(0016)]
And I’m here to keep an eye on them.\c\nThey did technically descend from the original\nkings of Galar, after all.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Seems you lot have been up to all sorts of things\nwhile I was stuck in Rose Tower trying to take\r\ncare of the mess the chairman left behind.[VAR 0114(0004)]
You’ve no idea! Those two were forcing Pokémon\nto Dynamax all over the place![VAR 0114(0005)]
And for that, we are really, truly sorry. Look\nat our sorriness.[VAR 0114(0068)]
We thought only of ourselves and brought harm\nto innocent Pokémon. We have truly caused\r\na large amount of trouble.[VAR 0114(0069)]
M[VAR 1100(00FF,0205)]asters. [VAR 0100(0000)], you helped us even\nthough we did those awful things...[VAR 0114(0068)]
You are so worthy of the throne, you could say\nit’s a Dynamax-sized amount of worthiness![VAR 0114(0069)]
I already told you two...\nZacian and Zamazenta are the real royalty.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Incorrect! We have abdicated the title to h[VAR 1100(0000,0202)]imer.\nThere are no other rulers but [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0068)]
Hmm. Now that I look closely, you absolutely do\nhave the air of a celebrity![VAR 0114(0069)]
Well, fancy that...\nI think you’ve grown on them, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh dear... Reluctantly, I’m afraid we two\nmust away.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Our tour to apologize to those we’ve\ntroubled awaits![VAR 0114(0069)]
Well then... Good-bye! Wahahahah!![VAR 0114(006A)]
Oi! Don’t go runnin’ off on your own.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Hop![VAR 0114(0004)]
Er, what?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Just so you know, I saw your Pokémon battle\nagainst Champion [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0004)]
You sure have gotten strong!\c\nYou were so good, I nearly sent out my Charizard\nwithout thinking, wanting to join in on the fun![VAR 0114(0004)]
It seems like you’ve found your own path to\nwalk in life, Hop.[VAR 0114(0004)]
As your older brother...\c\nNo, as your rival, you have my full support![VAR 0114(0004)]
I...I do?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh? Leon gave you some pretty high praise.\nYou look like the Meowth’s got your tongue, Hop.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Awww, zip it, Sonia! I do not!\nHehehe...[VAR 0114(0005)]
All right, I guess we should get going, too...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Right!\nThen it’s a race to see who gets back home first![VAR 0114(0005)]
I know you haven’t reached your full potential\nyet, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nTrain and prepare as much as you like. I’ll be\nwaiting here whenever you’re ready![VAR 0114(0005)]
Adventure across the Galar region to find many\nmore Pokémon to battle and catch!\c\nThe Battle Tower in Wyndon has opened, too!\nIt’s filled with Trainers stronger than those you’ve\r\nfaced up until now. Challenge them if you dare!
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! I’m giving it my best with my\nstudies! It’s not easy, but it’s still great fun![VAR 0114(0005)]
If it isn’t [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nHop’s been studying pretty hard, surprisingly.\nI’m sure he’d be glad to know you dropped by\r\nfor a visit.[VAR 0114(000B)]

The strongest Dragon-type move is called\nDraco Meteor.\c\nDo you want me to teach the move to\nyour Pokémon?
I understand... Moves that are too strong\ncan be difficult to use.
It looks like your Pokémon can learn my move,\nbut there’s one condition that needs to be met.\c\nThat is...the Pokémon has to be completely\nfriendly toward you.\c\nI can teach the move only after the Pokémon\nbecomes totally bonded with you.
None of the Pokémon you are with right now can\nlearn this move...\c\nCome back when you obtain a Pokémon that can\nlearn this move!
Then please select the Pokémon that will learn\nthis move.
Oh, this Pokémon can’t learn this move.
Oh, this is an Egg.\nIt can’t learn this move or any move.
Oh, this Pokémon already knows Draco Meteor.
Draco Meteor is indeed the strongest\nDragon-type move.\c\nHowever, using it harshly lowers the user’s\nSp. Atk stat.

Hm... You’re the traveler I’m supposed to guide,\nam I right?[VAR 0114(0042)]

You’re here to join the Master Dojo, are you not?\nI also train there.[VAR 0114(0072)]
What’s going on? Am I being mocked...by a kid?!\c\nBut I’m the colorful, caring, and\ncharismatic Klara![VAR 0114(0071)]
My goodness, this is a thick one.\nLike a poor, lost Wooloo...\c\nIt’s up to me—as an elegant adult—to make sure\nthey get the message.[VAR 0114(0072)]
Well then... How about we have a quick battle?\nJust so, y’know, we can see who’s better?[VAR 0114(0071)]

You would no doubt like to run around and\nexplore freely, but first, let’s make sure you can\r\nhandle yourself.[VAR 0114(0072)]
Since I’ve already been at the Master Dojo for\na little while now...[VAR 0114(0071)]
Naturally, as a member of the Master Dojo...[VAR 0114(0072)]
I’ll be the one testing you out!\nGo easy on me, OK?[VAR 0114(0071)]
I’ll be using my psychic powers to test your\nstrength! Come now... Don’t overexert yourself![VAR 0114(0072)]

Buuut...you see...our dojo is one that’s got a\nlong-standing reputation!\c\nEven the famous Champion Leon trained\nat our place![VAR 0114(0071)]

No offense, but maybe, just maybe,\nyou’re not quiiite good enough to make it?[VAR 0114(0071)]
What I’m trying to say is, I don’t think you’re\nquite up to snuff...[VAR 0114(0072)]
Sooo...how about this? Why not enjoy the sights,\nbut just stay away from the Master Dojo over\r\nthere, ’K?[VAR 0114(0071)]
Therefore! I suggest you ignore the Master Dojo\nstanding over there and head home as soon as\r\nyou’re done seeing the sights![VAR 0114(0072)]
Here, I’ll even give you this!\nY’know, as a souvenir![VAR 0114(0071)]
I suppose you can have this, too, as a\nparting gift.[VAR 0114(0072)]
Just show it when you visit a boutique or a\nhair salon, and they’ll let you buy stuff\r\nthat’s not available to most people![VAR 0114(0071)]
Show it when you next visit a boutique or\nhair salon, and I’m sure you’ll be able to find\r\nsome more-elegant garb, like mine.[VAR 0114(0072)]

Now here’s someone who’s not listed in my\ndatabase of students...[VAR 0114(0042)]
Hello, sweetie pie!\nIt’s not usual for you to bother greeting\r\na newcomer![VAR 0114(0074)]
This is Hyde—my darling only son.[VAR 0114(0074)]
Are you some kind of outlier?\nHere, you should give this a try.[VAR 0114(0075)]
But don’t open it, OK?\c\nIt’s got tech I developed inside, and I don’t want\nyou to go and ruin it.[VAR 0114(0075)]
He’s so good with his hands, always making\nsomething new. Such a clever boy.[VAR 0114(0074)]
And that handsome gent in the back is my darling\nhubby and the very master of the Master Dojo![VAR 0114(0074)]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0042)]
Why, hello there! My name is Mustard!\nI’m rather good at Pokémon battles, you know![VAR 0114(0073)]
I’m pleased as cheese that you could join us![VAR 0114(0073)]
Nice to...meet you?
Cheesed to meet you!
Heh heh, such a polite student!\nYou seem to be the hardworking type, too![VAR 0114(0073)]
Heh heh, I see you’ve got a sense of humor, too!\nGood, good![VAR 0114(0073)]
[~ 18]
[~ 19]
Don’t let him fool you into thinking he’s just a\nsilly old man.\c\nHe’s a real beast when he gets serious.[VAR 0114(0074)]
Well, darling, I’ll leave the rest up to you![VAR 0114(0074)]
Yaaay! This is my favorite part!\nI wanna see just how good you are![VAR 0114(0073)]
So, why not have a battle with little old me?[VAR 0114(0073)]
Just say the word when you’re ready![VAR 0114(0073)]
Aww! But I want to battle Master Mustard, too!
A quick recording of progress before a battle is\nthe first step to a safe adventure! Hi-yah!
A lot of people hear the word dojo and think of\na strict, serious place, but the Master Dojo is a\r\nlot of fun! Ms. Honey’s food is excellent, too!
I’d very much like to see what your battle\nstyle is!
The master’s a kind man. Don’t be afraid to\nshow him everything you’ve got!
I got an Exp. Charm from Hyde, too!\c\nJust keep it in your Bag, and it’ll boost the\nExp. Points your Pokémon earn!
I know I’m not wearing the dojo uniform, but\nI’m a student, too!\r\nThey didn’t have my size!
The Master Dojo’s a strange dojo, if you ask me.\c\nWe have all sorts of odd training routines, like\ncleaning up or even taking naps!
You...you have the scent of a powerful Trainer...
Nice to meet you!
If there’s anything you want to know about\nthe dojo, don’t hesitate to ask somebody else![VAR 0114(0071)]
You can always call if you run into any trouble.\nCall somebody else, that is.[VAR 0114(0072)]
You must be tired after that trek from the station.[VAR 0114(0074)]
If you and your Pokémon ever need to rest up,\nfeel free to use that room right there.[VAR 0114(0074)]

Yaaahooo! Are you ready for a battle?[VAR 0114(0073)]
Oh my, you like to take your time, don’t you?\nDon’t keep this old man waiting too long![VAR 0114(0073)]
All right! Let’s get this show started! This is\nthe best way to get to know new students![VAR 0114(0073)]
Bah ha ha! I lost!\nYou’re pretty strong, aren’t you?[VAR 0114(0073)]
Hey, the newbie won!\c\nMaster wasn’t going all out, but that’s still\npretty impressive!
Who is that kid, anyway?
The way you battle really shows me how much\nyou care about your Pokémon![VAR 0114(0073)]
Even if you’ve come because of a misunderstanding,\nas long as you have a will to learn...[VAR 0114(0073)]
then you’re welcome at the Master Dojo![VAR 0114(0073)]
I think we can all help each other become\nstronger! I’m happy you’ve come to join us![VAR 0114(0073)]
So on that note, here’s your Dojo Uniform![VAR 0114(0073)]
With that on, you’ll fit right in with the students\nof my Master Dojo.[VAR 0114(0073)]
You got a [VAR FF00(0008)]Dojo Uniform[VAR FF00(0000)]!
Hey, newbie!
If you want to change or just take a break,\nuse that room over there!
Now then![VAR 0114(0073)]
With [VAR 0100(0000)] here now, the dojo’s at\nmax capacity![VAR 0114(0073)]
It’s time to really start our training! You’ll all be\nfacing [VAR FF00(0006)]three trials[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0073)]
Three trials?!
Wait. Why is there a max capacity for this dojo?
And there’s more! The person who completes\nthe three trials will receive the [VAR FF00(0006)]secret armor[VAR FF00(0000)]\r\nof this dojo![VAR 0114(0073)]
Ooh! A secret set of armor! I want it!
Heh heh, that’s the spirit!\c\nNow, lemme explain the first trial...[VAR 0114(0073)]
Aww! But, Masterrr!\nYou haven’t given me my uniform yet![VAR 0114(0071)]
Pardon me, Master!\nI haven’t received my uniform yet![VAR 0114(0072)]
Why does that kid get a uniform but not me?!\nIt’s not fair![VAR 0114(0071)]
I daresay it’s unfair for only that child to get\na uniform. Unequal, even! I demand an\r\nitem swap![VAR 0114(0072)]
Oh dear. Do you really not have a uniform?\nMy bad, my bad![VAR 0114(0073)]
That’s easy to fix, though! I have another uniform\nright here for you, Klara![VAR 0114(0073)]
That’s easy to fix, though! I have another uniform\nright here for you, Avery![VAR 0114(0073)]
Hee hee! The squeaky wheel gets the grease![VAR 0114(0071)]
Ha! It does pay to complain sometimes![VAR 0114(0072)]
Klara got a Dojo Unif—
Avery got a Dojo Unif—
POKE![VAR 0114(0042)]
Huh?! What was that?[VAR 0114(0071)]
Eek! What in the world?[VAR 0114(0072)]
Wha—?! It’s gone! Where’d my Dojo Uniform go?[VAR 0114(0071)]
Hey! My Dojo Uniform! It’s gone missing![VAR 0114(0072)]
Po-po-po...[VAR 0114(0042)]
Huh?[VAR 0114(0071)]
Hmm?[VAR 0114(0072)]
Poke!
That speed...\nWas it really these Slowpoke?
I’ve never seen any Slowpoke move so fast!
Hey! Give it back!\nGive me my Dojo Uniform![VAR 0114(0071)]
How dare you? Are you using Trick?!\nReturn my Dojo Uniform immediately![VAR 0114(0072)]
Slooow? Slooow...
... ... ...
Poooke!
Hey! Get back here![VAR 0114(0071)]
Oh my! Where do you think you’re going?![VAR 0114(0072)]
Oops! Guess I let them out of their Poké Balls\na little too soon! Heh heh heh![VAR 0114(0073)]
Master...\nWhat’s up with those Slowpoke?
This is the first trial, my students...[VAR 0114(0073)]
You’ve all gotta chase after those fast\nSlowpoke, trained with care by little old me!\c\nBut that’s not all... You need to defeat them, too![VAR 0114(0073)]
And while you’re at it, could you get Klara’s\nDojo Uniform back?[VAR 0114(0073)]
And while you’re at it, could you get Avery’s\nDojo Uniform back?[VAR 0114(0073)]
Awww! Do we have to?!
Well, that’s that!\nDo your best, you lot![VAR 0114(0073)]
Do you want to change back into your\nusual clothes?
All set!\c\nTime to chase down those fast Slowpoke!
No need to change!\c\nTime to chase down those fast Slowpoke!
The first trial is to chase down the three\nfast Slowpoke!\c\nAnd while you’re at it, it would be cool if you\ncould get back the Dojo Uniform they stole![VAR 0114(0073)]
Slowpoke are usually super zoned out,\nbut that didn’t stop the master from raising\r\nthem to be super fast!
The way they moved...\nThose aren’t ordinary Slowpoke!\c\nMaybe they wanted to wear the Dojo Uniform?
I know you might be feeling nervous, being\nnew here and all.\c\nBut don’t you worry. All our students are good,\nthrough and through. They’ll take care of you.[VAR 0114(0074)]

Slooow?
You took back Klara’s [VAR FF00(0008)]Dojo Jacket[VAR FF00(0000)].
You took back Avery’s [VAR FF00(0008)]Dojo Jacket[VAR FF00(0000)].
Poh?
You took back Klara’s [VAR FF00(0008)]Dojo Tee[VAR FF00(0000)] and\n[VAR FF00(0008)]Dojo Shorts[VAR FF00(0000)]!
You took back Avery’s [VAR FF00(0008)]Dojo Tee[VAR FF00(0000)] and\n[VAR FF00(0008)]Dojo Shorts[VAR FF00(0000)]!
Kuhh!
You took back Klara’s [VAR FF00(0008)]Dojo Gloves[VAR FF00(0000)] and\n[VAR FF00(0008)]Dojo Legwear[VAR FF00(0000)].
You took back Avery’s [VAR FF00(0008)]Dojo Gloves[VAR FF00(0000)] and\n[VAR FF00(0008)]Dojo Legwear[VAR FF00(0000)].
You took back all of Klara’s [VAR FF00(0008)]Dojo Uniform[VAR FF00(0000)]!\nYou should go tell Master Mustard!
You took back all of Avery’s [VAR FF00(0008)]Dojo Uniform[VAR FF00(0000)]!\nYou should go tell Master Mustard!
Only two of those fast Slowpoke left!
Only one of those fast Slowpoke left!
These fast Slowpoke prefer wide open spaces.\nYou won’t see them going into forests!
The fast Slowpoke aren’t too great at swimming.\nThey couldn’t cross that river.\c\nLook around the wetlands—they probably didn’t\ngo farther than that!
I checked every nook and cranny of that cave,\nbut I didn’t find a single fast Slowpoke.
*huff huff*\nI’ve been running so long my legs feel like\r\nthey’re gonna fall off.\c\nIf I had a bike, it’d be so much easier to catch\nthese fast Slowpoke.

Oh, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Welcome back![VAR 0114(0074)]
You... Don’t tell me you got my uniform back\nall on your own![VAR 0114(0071)]
You... Were you able to reclaim my uniform all\nall by yourself?[VAR 0114(0072)]
Here you go!
You can have it back
You gave the [VAR FF00(0008)]Dojo Uniform[VAR FF00(0000)] to Klara.
You gave the [VAR FF00(0008)]Dojo Uniform[VAR FF00(0000)] to Avery.
Oh...\nWell, uh, thanks.[VAR 0114(0071)]
Hmph! You have my thanks.[VAR 0114(0072)]
Well mustered, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0073)]
You cleared the first trial like it was nothing![VAR 0114(0073)]
Why, I think this is the first time since Leon that\nsomeone was able to handle all three fast\r\nSlowpoke on their own![VAR 0114(0073)]
The rest of you tried very hard, too!\nYou were able to catch up to the Slowpoke,\r\nbut I guess you couldn’t defeat them.[VAR 0114(0073)]
Uuugh...[VAR 0114(0071)]
Tch...[VAR 0114(0072)]
Tell you what. Anyone who was able to catch up\nto a Slowpoke at least once gets a pass![VAR 0114(0073)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)] really outdid h[VAR 1100(0000,0202)]imerself, so it’s\nonly fair everyone else gets another chance.\r\nTry to make a comeback, everybody![VAR 0114(0073)]
Ooh! How generous!
*sigh*\nEither way, I’m still out.
Oh, that reminds me. Honey, where are those\nlittle ones?[VAR 0114(0073)]
Oh, that’s right, darling!\nI had nearly forgotten...[VAR 0114(0074)]
Squirtle! Bulbasaur!\nCome on in, sweeties![VAR 0114(0074)]
Driiip.
Viiine.
These are our sweet little Pokémon,\nBulbasaur and Squirtle.\r\nWe’ve all been taking care of them together.\c\nAnd I’d say they’re more than a little curious\nabout your strength as a Trainer.[VAR 0114(0074)]
Why don’t you pick one to keep for yourself?\nYou did succeed in the trial, after all![VAR 0114(0074)]
And just so you know, these two have been\nraised in a very special way.\c\nWhen they evolve, they’ll be able to Gigantamax![VAR 0114(0074)]
Both Bulbasaur and Squirtle will have the power\nto Gigantamax eventually. It’s a tough decision,\r\nisn’t it?\c\nGive it a good think before you choose one![VAR 0114(0074)]
You did great, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0073)]
Don’t get a big head just ’cause you did well![VAR 0114(0071)]
Don’t go getting all uppity from one\ntrifling success...[VAR 0114(0072)]
I tracked down a Slowpoke, but I was no match\nfor its speed...
You’re still new, but you’re doing great! I think\nI’ll call you “Ace Newbie”!
I just barely made it. I’m so relieved...
The purpose of that last trial was to learn to be\nable to read a Pokémon’s movements.
Squirtle and Bulbasaur are rare Pokémon that\nlive in the Kanto region.
The master’s training is always very strange.
Tsk! I couldn’t clear the trial. Looks like I’m not\ngetting that secret armor, but I can still do some\r\ntraining while I’m here to toughen up.
If only I’d had a bike... Those fast Slowpoke sure\nare, well...fast!
I had a feeling you were a strong one. I’d like to\ntest my skills against you sometime.
My legs are positively sore from running all over\nthe place.

Waaah!
Viiig!
So you’re going to go with our little Squirtle?\nIt’s great with Water-type moves![VAR 0114(0074)]
So you’re going to go with our sweet Bulbasaur?\nIt’s first-rate with Grass-type moves![VAR 0114(0074)]
Heehee! It’s so hard to choose just one, isn’t it?\nTake your time to think it over, love.[VAR 0114(0074)]
Squirt!
Bulba!
Squirtle became your Pokémon!
Bulbasaur became your Pokémon!
Squirtle looks pleased as punch that you\nchose it![VAR 0114(0074)]
Bulbasaur looks pleased as punch that you\nchose it![VAR 0114(0074)]
And don’t you worry, Bulbasaur.\nI’ll be sure to raise you with lots of love.[VAR 0114(0074)]
And don’t you worry, Squirtle.\nI’ll be sure to raise you with lots of love.[VAR 0114(0074)]
I’ll make you oh-so-strong, so you’ll never lose\nto [VAR 0101(0001)]. Teehee![VAR 0114(0074)]
Bulba?
Squirt?
Ms. Honey! If you want that Pokémon to learn\n[VAR FF00(0006)]new moves[VAR FF00(0000)], you can leave that to me!
[~ 17]
Well, aren’t you just the sweetest thing![VAR 0114(0074)]
That lovely lad is always so kind. Give him a bit of\nArmorite Ore, and he’ll teach your darling new\r\nPokémon a new move. You should give it a try.[VAR 0114(0074)]
Remember that your new Pokémon will be able\nto Gigantamax once it has fully evolved.\r\nSo be sure to raise it well![VAR 0114(0074)]
Dynamaxing... A mysterious phenomenon unique\nto Pokémon of Galar...[VAR 0114(0073)]
And then there’s Gigantamaxing, a very special\nway of Dynamaxing for very special Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0073)]
Their moves change, of course, but their\nappearances change, too.[VAR 0114(0073)]
Speaking of Gigantamax, there’s that secret\nrecipe of the Master Dojo!\c\nDrinking it makes you [VAR FF00(0006)]gigantic and strong[VAR FF00(0000)]!\nI call it [VAR FF00(0006)]Max Soup[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0073)]
I’d love to have a bowl of Max Soup full of\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Max Mushrooms[VAR FF00(0000)] right about now. It sure has\r\nbeen a while...[VAR 0114(0073)]
And that’s why your second trial shall be\nmushroom picking![VAR 0114(0073)]
Max Mushrooms are the key to Gigantamaxing,\nand I’m tasking you with finding three![VAR 0114(0073)]
Max Mushrooms are [VAR FF00(0006)]red with a spiral pattern[VAR FF00(0000)].\nI’m pretty sure they grow in dark, humid places![VAR 0114(0073)]
And with that, your next trial begins!\nI’m countin’ on ya![VAR 0114(0073)]
Oh... Whoooa!
Sorry, not sorry, but I haven’t accepted you as\nthe hotshot everyone else seems to think you are.[VAR 0114(0071)]
You’d better think again if you think I’m gonna\nlet you finish this trial before me, mate...[VAR 0114(0071)]
It would seem that I am fated not to accept your\ncapabilities as of yet...[VAR 0114(0072)]
I will obtain the Max Mushrooms first and claim\nvictory with my own two hands![VAR 0114(0072)]
Your second trial is picking three\nMax Mushrooms!\c\nMax Mushrooms are red with a spiral pattern.\nI’m pretty sure they grow in dark, humid places![VAR 0114(0073)]
We’re going to be doing some training\nby ourselves!
I wonder if Max Mushrooms grow in the\nForest of Focus. Or maybe in the cave just past\r\nthe forest?
Hm? I’ll stay back and watch things from here.\nI failed the Slowpoke trial, after all.
Good luck out there!\nThinking about Max Mushrooms gets\r\nme hungry...\c\nUh, I mean—I’ll be here cheering for you!
I’m going to take good care of that cute\nlittle Bulbasaur. Raise your Squirtle well![VAR 0114(0074)]
I’m going to take good care of that cute\nlittle Squirtle. Raise your Bulbasaur well![VAR 0114(0074)]

Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nMy bad, my bad![VAR 0114(0073)]
It just dawned on me that you’re brand-new\nto the Isle of Armor![VAR 0114(0073)]
I bet you have no idea where to even begin\nlooking for Max Mushrooms![VAR 0114(0073)]
C’mon—let’s go for a walk, and I’ll show you\nsome mushroom hot spots.[VAR 0114(0073)]
Dum dum dee dee...\nLa la de daaa...[VAR 0114(0073)]
Now, usually the Forest of Focus is chock-full of\nMax Mushrooms.[VAR 0114(0073)]
But the thing is, a swarm of Greedent came\nthrough and ate every last one here![VAR 0114(0073)]
So I’m thinking maybe you’ll have more luck\nfinding Max Mushrooms if you go check\r\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Warm-Up Tunnel[VAR FF00(0000)]. It’s out on the other side of\r\nthe forest![VAR 0114(0073)]
Just watch where you’re going in the forest, ’K?\nIt’s easy to get lost![VAR 0114(0073)]
Anyhoo... Good luck with the hunt for\nMax Mushrooms! Catch you back at the dojo![VAR 0114(0073)]
Hey, Max Mushrooms!\c\nOh, it’s only you, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nSheesh! Don’t confuse me like that!
I’ve searched the Forest of Focus high and low,\nbut there’s no sign of any Max Mushrooms...\r\nCould they be growing somewhere else?
Blast! I’ve gotten disoriented!\nWarm-Up Tunnel isn’t this way!
I don’t think there are any Max Mushrooms\nthis way. I need to hone my sense of direction!
I want to get to the Training Lowlands, but this\nisn’t the right way to go...
If I brought back Foongus instead of\nMax Mushrooms, d’you think they’d notice?

Some wild Max Mushrooms!\nDo you want to pick them?
Hold up a sec![VAR 0114(0042)]
Wait just one moment![VAR 0114(0042)]
*wheeze*... *wheeze*...[VAR 0114(0071)]
*pant*... *pant*...[VAR 0114(0072)]
Hellooo, what’s this?!\nThree Max Mushrooms in one spot?\c\nHere I thought I’d need to go find them one\nby one![VAR 0114(0071)]
Hah! Just as I expected!\nMultiple Max Mushrooms growing in a bunch![VAR 0114(0072)]
I saw those mushrooms first!\nI swear![VAR 0114(0071)]
My psychic powers picked up on these\nMax Mushrooms eons before you found them.[VAR 0114(0072)]
I’ve been at the dojo longer and all. Sooo...\nit’s only fair that you let me have ’em. Riiight?[VAR 0114(0071)]
I believe I should be the one to get those\nMax Mushrooms. First come, first served, and all![VAR 0114(0072)]
No way!
Sure, you can have them!
Tsk! Yeah, I figured that’s what you’d say...[VAR 0114(0071)]
Hmph! I knew you wouldn’t listen to reason.[VAR 0114(0072)]
Waaait... What’s this now? Are you givin’ me\nattitude? Pityin’ me, are you?![VAR 0114(0071)]
What’s this? Are you trying to show you’re\nstronger than me? How distasteful![VAR 0114(0072)]
Gosh, you’re a pain in the neck...\nYou just show up outta nowhere, and just\r\nhappen to be young and talented...[VAR 0114(0071)]
I find your presence most disturbing!\nYou show up at the dojo unannounced\r\nand go on to show such talent, even though\r\nyou’re still so young...[VAR 0114(0072)]
If you’re looking to get in my way, well,\nI think some vile poisons will take care of that![VAR 0114(0071)]
You dare get in my way?\c\nI warned you about my psychic powers, and now\nyou’ll experience them firsthand![VAR 0114(0072)]
Aaagh! Why can’t I win?!\nI’m trying as hard as I can!\r\nWhat am I missing?![VAR 0114(0071)]
Blast it. Victory still eludes me...\nWhat is it that I lack? What do I need?[VAR 0114(0072)]
Fine, you can have those silly mushrooms!\nI’m going to find better ones, anyway![VAR 0114(0071)]
Very well, you can have those ones.\nI’ll go and find myself some Max Mushrooms\r\nthat are far more elegant![VAR 0114(0072)]
So there! Nyah![VAR 0114(0071)]

Easy peasy!
I’m managing somehow!
You mean you’ve already managed to find three\nMax Mushrooms?![VAR 0114(0074)]
I’ve been checking in on everybody’s progress,\nbut it seems you’re in first place once again![VAR 0114(0074)]

Hey there, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nWelcome back! Looks like you nailed the trial![VAR 0114(0073)]
Congrats on finding the Max Mushrooms!\nTrial number two was no problem for you![VAR 0114(0073)]
All my other students ended up getting lost\nin the forest...[VAR 0114(0073)]
Turns out finding Max Mushrooms was the least\nof their problems![VAR 0114(0073)]
It’s a shame, but I guess everyone other than\n[VAR 0100(0000)] will fail the trial...[VAR 0114(0073)]
Well, first things first—a proper meal!\nLet’s have the Max Mushrooms made into\r\na delicious Max Soup, shall we?[VAR 0114(0073)]
Mmm, mmm, mmm!\nI’ve really outdone myself this time![VAR 0114(0074)]
Now all that’s left to add are those lovely\nMax Mushrooms you’ve brought us![VAR 0114(0074)]

M-Ms. Honey...I beg you!\nW-wait just one moment...[VAR 0114(0072)]
Why, Klara![VAR 0114(0074)]
Why, Avery![VAR 0114(0074)]
What in the world has gotten into you!\nI’ve never seen you in such a flutter...[VAR 0114(0074)]
*pant*... *pant*...[VAR 0114(0071)]
*pant*... *pant*...[VAR 0114(0072)]
I...I’ve got some Max Mushrooms, too![VAR 0114(0071)]
I...I’ve also obtained some Max Mushrooms![VAR 0114(0072)]
Oho! Nice work, Klara!\nYou must’ve searched hard for those![VAR 0114(0073)]
Oho! Nice work, Avery!\nYou must’ve searched hard for those![VAR 0114(0073)]
That makes you the second person to pass\nthe second trial![VAR 0114(0073)]
That makes you the second person to pass\nthe second trial![VAR 0114(0073)]
Waaaaaah! I did it! I did it!\n*sob* *sniff*...[VAR 0114(0071)]
*sniff*...\nI did it...\r\nY-yes, I did search rather hard...[VAR 0114(0072)]
Aww, chin up, darling Klara!\nYou did it! This is a cause for celebration![VAR 0114(0074)]
Aww, chin up, darling Avery!\nYou did it! This is a cause for celebration![VAR 0114(0074)]
Master, Ms. Honey...please, can I ask for\nsomething, just this once?[VAR 0114(0071)]
Master, Ms. Honey...if you could grant me one\nwish, just this once, I would be indebted.[VAR 0114(0072)]
I want you to use my Max Mushrooms in the\nMax Soup![VAR 0114(0071)]
Would you be so kind as to use my\nMax Mushrooms in the Max Soup?[VAR 0114(0072)]
I really want to share my hard work with\neverybody here![VAR 0114(0071)]
I feel that everyone here should enjoy the\ntaste of my efforts...[VAR 0114(0072)]
Oh, Klara...[VAR 0114(0074)]
Oh, Avery...[VAR 0114(0074)]
Well! If that’s all you’re after...\nthen I’m perfectly happy to oblige![VAR 0114(0074)]
Though this is hardly the first time you’ve asked\nfor something, and I rather doubt it’ll be the last.[VAR 0114(0074)]
Though this is hardly the first time you’ve asked\nfor something, and I rather doubt it’ll be the last.[VAR 0114(0074)]
Ms. Honey...[VAR 0114(0071)]
Ms. Honey.[VAR 0114(0072)]
I hope you don’t feel that your thunder’s being\nstolen, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0074)]
But we’re a family here, and families share! So...\nwe’ll go ahead and use Klara’s mushrooms today![VAR 0114(0074)]
But we’re a family here, and families share! So...\nwe’ll go ahead and use Avery’s mushrooms today![VAR 0114(0074)]
It’s just so rare for her to try hard at something.\nI really want to reward that.\r\nYou understand, don’t you?[VAR 0114(0074)]
It’s just so rare for him to try hard at something.\nI really want to reward that.\r\nYou understand, don’t you?[VAR 0114(0074)]
You can hold on to the Max Mushrooms you\nfound. I’m sure you’ll find a good use for them![VAR 0114(0074)]
Oh...and don’t worry! You still totally passed the\ntrial with flying colors![VAR 0114(0073)]
Think of those Max Mushrooms as an\nextra reward.[VAR 0114(0073)]
All right, everybody! Soup’s on![VAR 0114(0074)]
The famous Max Soup of the Master Dojo![VAR 0114(0074)]
Well...I’m famished!\nTime to dig in![VAR 0114(0073)]
Let’s eat!
You enjoyed the Max Soup...
Oh, I never did explain the big deal about this\nsoup, did I?[VAR 0114(0073)]
You see, when one drinks this dojo’s famous\nMax Soup...[VAR 0114(0073)]
You feel Dynamax energy welling up from\ninside you?!
No, you don’t... That kind of thing doesn’t\nhappen if a human has the soup.[VAR 0114(0073)]
But! Things are a bit different when certain\nPokémon drink the soup![VAR 0114(0073)]
You see, there are some Pokémon that have\ndistinct potential...[VAR 0114(0073)]
and when they drink the soup, their Dynamax\nform will change into a Gigantamax form![VAR 0114(0073)]
I’ll keep one of our lads in the kitchen on soup\nduty from now on, too.[VAR 0114(0074)]
So you can ask him to serve up a fresh bowl of\nMax Soup whenever you need![VAR 0114(0074)]
Now then, let’s wrap things up![VAR 0114(0073)]
You all did your best on the second trial, and\nI’m proud of everyone here![VAR 0114(0073)]
And last but not least...[VAR 0114(0073)]
Thanks for the soup, Honey![VAR 0114(0073)]
Thanks for the soup, Ms. Honey!
By the way, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nMeet me in my room when you have a moment.[VAR 0114(0073)]
Hmmm? Did the master call for you, too?[VAR 0114(0071)]
What’s this? Are you here because the master\nsummoned you, too?[VAR 0114(0072)]
I spent the whole time being chased around the\nForest of Focus by a Venipede...
You just joined the dojo, and yet you’ve already\ncompleted two of the trials!\c\nI’d expect nothing less from a talent that Klara\nbrought into the fold!
You just joined the dojo, and yet you’ve already\ncompleted two of the trials!\c\nI’d expect nothing less from a talent that Avery\nbrought into the fold!
I hear something amazing happens if you\nfeed a cluster of Max Mushrooms to a Pokémon\r\nduring a battle.
Having us compete and fight over the limited\nnumber of Max Mushrooms...\c\nThat trial’s pretty brutal when you stop and\nthink about it...
I’m glad I wasn’t selected for soup duty!
Master’s summoned you, right?\nYou should go see what he wants!
Chasing after Slowpoke...and then hunting down\nmushrooms... What could the final trial be?
Congratulations on completing the trial!
Only two completed the trial—Klara and you...\c\nI hear the footsteps of an approaching showdown!
Only two completed the trial—Avery and you...\c\nI hear the footsteps of an approaching showdown!
That Max Soup was something else!
Don’t worry—the kid on soup duty knows what\nhe’s doing. I made sure I taught him well![VAR 0114(0074)]

There you are, [VAR 0100(0000)], Klara.\nThanks for coming![VAR 0114(0073)]
There you are, [VAR 0100(0000)], Avery.\nThanks for coming![VAR 0114(0073)]
Sooo...what’s this all about, Master?\nWhat did you want to tell us?[VAR 0114(0071)]
When I heard you had something to tell me,\nI came as soon as I could, Master.[VAR 0114(0072)]
Right! Well, I’ve decided that you two...[VAR 0114(0073)]
will now take the Master Dojo’s...[VAR 0114(0073)]
final...last...ultimate...third trial![VAR 0114(0073)]
The final...last...ultimate...third trial?![VAR 0114(0071)]
A final...last...ultimate...third trial, you say?[VAR 0114(0072)]
Final?
Last?
Ultimate?
Third trial?
What’s that?
Uh...so basically this is the last trial?[VAR 0114(0071)]
So are you saying that this would be the\nlast trial?[VAR 0114(0072)]
Ah, well, yes.\nThat’s the gist of it.[VAR 0114(0073)]
You two are the only ones who successfully\nfinished the second trial![VAR 0114(0073)]
You two are the only ones who successfully\nfinished the second trial![VAR 0114(0073)]
You’ve pushed each other to greater\nheights and helped each other grow.[VAR 0114(0073)]
So I’d say it’s time to finally see who is stronger...\nin a Dynamax Pokémon battle![VAR 0114(0073)]
We’re going to battle? That’s the last trial?[VAR 0114(0071)]
We are to battle one another?\nThat is the last trial?[VAR 0114(0072)]
Yep! The rules are simple. Whoever wins will\ncomplete the trial![VAR 0114(0073)]
The winner will be granted the [VAR FF00(0006)]secret armor[VAR FF00(0000)] of\nthe Master Dojo![VAR 0114(0073)]
This is it... Finally...[VAR 0114(0071)]
This is it... At last...[VAR 0114(0072)]
But can I...?[VAR 0114(0071)]
Can I really...?[VAR 0114(0072)]
The battle will be held in the Battle Court\nbehind the Master Dojo![VAR 0114(0073)]
The court is a Power Spot, so you can Dynamax\nto your heart’s content.[VAR 0114(0073)]
I-I’ve gotta get going![VAR 0114(0071)]
I-I must make haste![VAR 0114(0072)]
I need to go there right away to prepare my pure\nheart for this![VAR 0114(0071)]
I must make for the Battle Court, posthaste!\nI must meditate on my upcoming victory![VAR 0114(0072)]
I’m going on ahead, ’K?[VAR 0114(0071)]
A good day to you, then. I’ll be on my way.[VAR 0114(0072)]
You can laze about like a Slowpoke and take as\nmuch time as you need![VAR 0114(0071)]
Feel free to take it easy like a Slowpoke, and\ntake all the time you need to get ready![VAR 0114(0072)]
...[VAR 0114(0073)]
Klara... She’s got talent—that’s for sure—but it’s\ncaused her to slack off.[VAR 0114(0073)]
Avery... He’s got talent—that’s for sure—but it’s\ncaused him to slack off.[VAR 0114(0073)]
She’s never felt the need to try hard at anything,\nI guess.[VAR 0114(0073)]
He’s never felt the need to try hard at anything,\nI guess.[VAR 0114(0073)]

Even with his training here at the dojo, I can tell\nhe’s been doing just the bare minimum.[VAR 0114(0073)]

But things have changed since you arrived,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0073)]

Maybe you’ve helped awaken some sort of\npassion and drive in him, eh?[VAR 0114(0073)]
Still...I only hope that motivation isn’t put\ntoward anything mischievous.[VAR 0114(0073)]
Still...I only hope that motivation isn’t put\ntoward anything mischievous.[VAR 0114(0073)]
Remember—head to the Battle Court behind the\ndojo when you’re ready![VAR 0114(0073)]
Only one more trial, and you’ll get the\nsecret armor!
Hee hee. Klara seems positively bursting with\nenergy, doesn’t she?
Hee hee. Avery seems positively bursting with\nenergy, doesn’t he?
The Battle Court is through the door in the dojo!
A battle with Klara...\c\nYou should stay on your guard.
A battle with Avery...\c\nYou should stay on your guard.
Fellow students settling their rivalry in a battle!\nWhich side should I cheer on?
Good luck on your last trial. Everyone will be\ncheering you on!
Klara ran toward the Battle Court like she had\nsomething really important to do.
Avery ran toward the Battle Court like he had\nsomething really important to do.
All right! This is my chance to see Dynamax\nPokémon up close!
Hehehe... Finally time for a proper battle...\nIf we’d been doing this kind of training from\r\nthe start, I would’ve made it to the final trial.
Wow! A one-on-one battle with Klara?\nHow exciting!
Wow! A one-on-one battle with Avery?\nHow exciting!
In battles, there’s always a winner, which means\nthere’s always got to be a loser, too...\c\nOh? Sorry. Don’t mind me!\nJust talking to myself![VAR 0114(0074)]

You’re here.[VAR 0114(0071)]
So, you’ve come at last.[VAR 0114(0072)]
When I beat you, I’ll get the secret armor...[VAR 0114(0071)]
Defeating you will grant me the secret armor...[VAR 0114(0072)]
and then I’ll become a Poison-type Gym Leader![VAR 0114(0071)]
then I will at last have what I need to become a\nPsychic-type Gym Leader![VAR 0114(0072)]
I’ve got to win, no matter what...[VAR 0114(0071)]
No matter what it takes, I refuse to accept\nanything but a complete and utter victory...[VAR 0114(0072)]
I’m gonna go all out and totally beat you.\nYou ready?[VAR 0114(0071)]
I’m coming at you with everything I have.\nAre you prepared?[VAR 0114(0072)]
Huh?! Aw, come on! You’re gonna leave me\nhanging after all that? Well, whatever...[VAR 0114(0071)]
You’re going to tell me you’re not ready?\nAfter all that’s been said?\r\nTruly, your Nature must be Bold.[VAR 0114(0072)]
Ugh! Don’t talk to me until you’re ready to\nbattle me![VAR 0114(0071)]
*sigh*...\nPlease speak with me once you’re\r\nactually ready for this.[VAR 0114(0072)]
Looks like the two of you are ready.[VAR 0114(0073)]
Good luck!
I’m cheering for both of you![VAR 0114(0074)]
All right, you two, take your places![VAR 0114(0073)]
The Master Dojo’s final trial...[VAR 0114(0073)]
Ready![VAR 0114(0073)]
Aaaaaand go![VAR 0114(0073)]
The victor has been decided![VAR 0114(0073)]
The one to complete the third trial is...\nyou, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0073)]
Hooray! Hooray!
That was amazing!
What a fierce battle!
Oh, well done! You both gave it your all![VAR 0114(0074)]
Aw man... I totally lost...[VAR 0114(0071)]
It appears...I have lost.[VAR 0114(0072)]
Hah, well, this stinks. I do everything—even\ncheat a little—and still lose.[VAR 0114(0071)]
Heh, how pathetic. I lost even though I resorted\nto such underhanded tactics.[VAR 0114(0072)]
I don’t expect a young, talented kid like you\nto really get it, but...[VAR 0114(0071)]
I don’t think young, capable children like you\ncan understand how I feel.[VAR 0114(0072)]
I...really was trying, you know?\nAs hard as I could...[VAR 0114(0071)]
I am just an average man who gave everything he\npossibly could...[VAR 0114(0072)]
Maybe it’s time for me to just give up on my\ndream of being a Gym Leader...[VAR 0114(0071)]
Perhaps it’s time I stopped playing around and\ngave up my dream of being a Gym Leader...[VAR 0114(0072)]
Once they find out what I did, I’ll be expelled\nfrom the dojo anyway.[VAR 0114(0071)]
After the less-than-reputable things I did,\nI’m likely to be expelled from the dojo.[VAR 0114(0072)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], you can tell the master\nthat I cheated.[VAR 0114(0071)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], you are free to tell the master\nabout the awful things I did.[VAR 0114(0072)]
OK
I won’t
I’m sorry...[VAR 0114(0071)]
Sorry for what I did...[VAR 0114(0072)]
Huh? B-but why?\c\nIt was supposed to be a fair battle, and I\ncheated just so I could win...[VAR 0114(0071)]
Wh-what are you saying? But I turned to the\nshadows like a Dark type to try to win![VAR 0114(0072)]
Oh, no need to tell me...\nYou can’t hide anything from little old me![VAR 0114(0073)]
That’s your strength, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nKindness toward both your Pokémon and\nyour rivals![VAR 0114(0073)]
M-Master?![VAR 0114(0071)]
M-Master?![VAR 0114(0072)]
I should apologize on Klara’s behalf, too, as\nher master.[VAR 0114(0073)]
I should apologize on Avery’s behalf, too, as\nhis master.[VAR 0114(0073)]
What she did was wrong, but...[VAR 0114(0073)]
What he did was wrong, but...[VAR 0114(0073)]
she just didn’t want to be beaten by her rival—\nthat’s all. She’s a good, hardworking student.[VAR 0114(0073)]
he just didn’t want to be beaten by his rival—\nthat’s all. He’s a good, hardworking student.[VAR 0114(0073)]

*sniff*\nMaster...I thank you...\r\nYou have my apologies, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0072)]
As for your punishment, Klara, you’re going to\nlook after the Pokémon in the dojo for\r\nsix months...by yourself![VAR 0114(0073)]
As for your punishment, Avery, you’re going to\nlook after the Pokémon in the dojo for\r\nsix months...by yourself![VAR 0114(0073)]
What?! I mean, yeah, that’s a lot of work, but...\nis that all?![VAR 0114(0071)]
What?! Is that all I have to do? And you’ll\nforgive me?[VAR 0114(0072)]
Of course! Let’s work on strengthening\nyour heart![VAR 0114(0073)]
O-OK![VAR 0114(0071)]
O-OK![VAR 0114(0072)]
All right, everyone!\nThings are settled here![VAR 0114(0073)]
I’m so proud of you both!\nYou mustered so much effort and tried so hard![VAR 0114(0074)]
I got so teared up that I couldn’t even see half\nthe battle, but what I saw was amazing![VAR 0114(0074)]
So moving!
I’m tearing up!
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0073)]
You gave it your best and triumphed, even\nwhen faced with an unfair challenge.[VAR 0114(0073)]
To you, who has completed all the trials...[VAR 0114(0073)]
I grant the secret armor of the Master Dojo![VAR 0114(0073)]
It’ll take some time to prepare, so I’ll go ahead\nand get things sorted.[VAR 0114(0073)]
And that’s all, gang! As you were![VAR 0114(0073)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0071)]
Pardon me. Um...[VAR 0114(0072)]
Um! I... Well...[VAR 0114(0071)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], I...[VAR 0114(0072)]
You’re...really strong![VAR 0114(0071)]
I will admit to acknowledging your strength\njust a little.[VAR 0114(0072)]
H-hey! Don’t just ignore me![VAR 0114(0071)]
Ignoring me and leaving first...\nIs your Nature Hasty?[VAR 0114(0072)]
Wow! You’re going to get the secret armor!\nWhat kind of armor do you think it is?
*sniff*\nKlara... She did her best...
*sniff*\nAvery... He did his best...
You were really, really great!
The last trial was just an ordinary\nPokémon battle...\c\nI guess the master wanted a pure show of skill\nand strength?
What did the master tell you after\nyour battle?
You’re really strong! I bet you’d really rake it in\nif you opened your own dojo, huh?
What an amazing battle! Klara did great, too!
What an amazing battle! Avery did great, too!
I thought I saw the Battle Court light up at the\nstart of the battle.\c\nMaybe it was just my imagination...
I’d be honored to meet you on the field\nof battle someday.
Congrats! You were so cool!
One day...I’d like to be strong like you.
One day I hope to be as strong as...\c\nNo, never mind. Use Amnesia and forget\nwhat I just said.
Everyone’s happy to win something, aren’t they?\nBut losing is also something to be valued.\c\nIt’s the fuel that propels you to growth.\nKnow what I mean, love?[VAR 0114(0074)]

Bear?
This Pokémon is in fact the secret armor of\nthe Master Dojo!\c\nSay hello to...Kubfu![VAR 0114(0073)]
I know... I know... It’s tiny...\c\nBut raise it with diligence, and it’ll become\nstrong enough to see you through any battle,\r\njust like a suit of armor.\c\nNo opponent will be able to get past it![VAR 0114(0073)]
This one in particular has amazing potential!\nProblem is—it’s a bit shy...[VAR 0114(0073)]
It just doesn’t seem to have much confidence\nin itself.[VAR 0114(0073)]
So I was thinking, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nMaybe if it joins you on your adventure, that’ll\nhelp it break out of its shell a little bit![VAR 0114(0073)]
[~ 6]
So take good care of Kubfu, ’K?\nIt’s in your hands now![VAR 0114(0073)]
B-bearma...
Kubfu became your Pokémon!
Now then...[VAR 0114(0073)]
The first thing for you to do is become best\nfriends with Kubfu! You need to build trust![VAR 0114(0073)]
Kubfu hasn’t really had a chance to explore\nthe world outside the dojo, so...[VAR 0114(0073)]
Maybe it’ll help you become better friends if you\nlet it have a look around! Maybe take it to a\r\nspot that has a [VAR FF00(0006)]great view[VAR FF00(0000)] of the Isle of Armor![VAR 0114(0073)]
I’ll have my students standing at good spots,\nso just keep an eye out![VAR 0114(0073)]
And of course having battles or camping out\ntogether will also help you become more\r\nfriendly toward each other.[VAR 0114(0073)]
What else...? Oh, I know!\c\nI hereby grant you permission to keep a Pokémon\nout of its Poké Ball here on the Isle of Armor!\c\nYou can now let the Pokémon at the head of your\nteam out of its Poké Ball and [VAR FF00(0006)]take it for a stroll[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0073)]
You’ll be friends in no time if you walk together!\nGo and take a stroll with Kubfu, why don’t you?[VAR 0114(0073)]
Once you’re best buddies, we’ll start Kubfu’s\ntraining in earnest. Just stop by and let me\r\nknow once you think you’re ready![VAR 0114(0073)]
So, the secret armor was actually a Pokémon!\nWho’d have thought?\c\nAnd those moves... It was really something else!
Klara seems down in the dumps...\c\nI wonder if there’s anything I can do to cheer\nher up...
Avery seems down in the dumps...\c\nI wonder if there’s anything I can do to cheer\nhim up...
I’m going to start preparing now—just so I’m not\ncaught off guard if the master decides to send\r\nus out on another sudden trial!
Think about the meaning of what you’re doing,\nand it’ll help you focus even more.
There are lots of little islands around the\nIsle of Armor.\c\nIf you have a bike that lets you ride on water,\nit might be fun to go and explore!
I guess I can take a break in training for now.\nMaybe I’ll go gather tons of Armorite Ore!
I wonder when they’ll get around to making a\nDojo Uniform in my size...
I heard that the master found Kubfu overseas\nduring his travels and brought it back to Galar.
The secret armor had some moves!\nI can’t wait to see how it grows!
Kubfu is so cute!\nI should’ve tried harder on the trials!

What’s this? What’s this?\nLet’s see how you and Kubfu are getting along...[VAR 0114(0073)]
Aw, you’ve hardly gotten to know each other\nat all! Go on, then. Spend more time together!\r\nGo have some fun![VAR 0114(0073)]
Getting there, but there’s still lots of room\nfor improvement.\c\nYour bond will become stronger as you have\nbattles and gain experience together![VAR 0114(0073)]
Oooh! I can tell you’re warming up to\neach other!\c\nI hear a Soothe Bell is great for becoming\nfriends with Pokémon, too![VAR 0114(0073)]
You’re just starting to become friends!\nHow wonderful!\c\nDon’t forget—playing together while camping is\na great way to build camaraderie![VAR 0114(0073)]
[~ 5]
I put some little markers on your Town Map for\nwhere the view of the Isle of Armor’s\r\njust gorgeous. You and Kubfu should go and\r\nenjoy the scenery![VAR 0114(0073)]
Once you two are the best of friends, we’ll start\nwith Kubfu’s proper training![VAR 0114(0073)]
Bearmor!
Good, good! You two are just the best of friends\nnow, aren’t you?[VAR 0114(0073)]
Kubfu’s really become more confident.\nHow wonderful![VAR 0114(0073)]
I daresay I think you’re both ready.[VAR 0114(0073)]
Follow me, you two.[VAR 0114(0073)]
Hmm? Why, [VAR 0100(0000)], I don’t see\nKubfu in your team or in your Boxes.[VAR 0114(0073)]
There’s no point in this training without Kubfu.\nAre you sure you want to continue?[VAR 0114(0073)]
Are you sure you won’t regret continuing with\nthe training, even without Kubfu?[VAR 0114(0073)]

That’s what I thought!\nWe’ll continue with the training once you bring\r\nKubfu back![VAR 0114(0073)]
Hmm? Oh, Kubfu’s at the Pokémon Nursery?\c\nI guess I’ll have to wait until it’s back with you\nto see how friendly you’ve become![VAR 0114(0073)]

Now then, [VAR 0100(0000)]! And Kubfu!\nIf you want to become stronger...[VAR 0114(0073)]
there are special training grounds just for Kubfu![VAR 0114(0073)]
Prepare yourselves for the...[VAR FF00(0006)]Towers of Two Fists[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0073)]
The blue tower is the [VAR FF00(0006)]Tower of Waters[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0073)]
And the red tower is the [VAR FF00(0006)]Tower of Darkness[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0073)]
Choose wisely, since you’ll only be able to climb\none of the two towers.[VAR 0114(0073)]
Kubfu’s fighting style will change depending on\nthe tower you choose... And the [VAR FF00(0006)]types it gets[VAR FF00(0000)]\r\n[VAR FF00(0006)]will change[VAR FF00(0000)] as well! Think carefully![VAR 0114(0073)]
Each tower’s five stories tall, and each floor has\na tough opponent waiting for you.\c\nMake sure you [VAR FF00(0006)]level up Kubfu properly[VAR FF00(0000)] before\ntrying to climb up![VAR 0114(0073)]
You can reach both of the towers by heading\nthrough the Forest of Focus.[VAR 0114(0073)]
[~ 11]
[~ 12]
You might even be able to find a shortcut if you\ncan ride your bike across the river![VAR 0114(0073)]
I’m really looking forward to when you two\nmake it to the top of one of those towers!\r\nIt’s going to be so exciting![VAR 0114(0073)]
The Towers of Two Fists were made specially for\nKubfu to train in to help it grow.\c\nPick either the Tower of Waters or the Tower\nof Darkness, and try to reach the top![VAR 0114(0073)]
You need to challenge the [VAR FF00(0006)]Towers of Two Fists[VAR FF00(0000)],\nspecial training grounds for Kubfu![VAR 0114(0073)]
You really need to have Kubfu with you for\nthis training, though...[VAR 0114(0073)]
It’s not too late to find Kubfu though!\nCome here together so you can start\r\nyour training![VAR 0114(0073)]

Oh, hello there, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nNothing, nothing. Just talking to myself![VAR 0114(0073)]
The Trainers in the Towers of Two Fists are all\nsenior students of the dojo!\c\nI hear that once they’re called to duty, they go\nto the towers and just stay there, ready for\r\nany challenger.
Klara seems to be taking her training seriously\nthese days! Maybe it’s something she ate?
Avery seems to be taking his training seriously\nthese days! Maybe it’s something he ate?
I heard that way back when, Champion Leon\ntried to get to the Towers of Two Fists but\r\ngot lost along the way.\c\nThey say he somehow managed to wander\nall the way back to Postwick!
I could evolve it into a Water type...or maybe a\nDark type...\c\nBut then Kubfu is cute as is, too!\nI wonder what I’d do if it were up to me.
The scenery is just top-notch around the Tower\nof Waters.\c\nThe master and Ms. Honey often go for\nwalking dates around the area!
I wish there was some way to make tons of\nmoney really quickly...
Once I get stronger, I’m going to participate\nin the next Gym Challenge!
Sometimes I get really lonely and want to go\nback home, but then Ms. Honey gives me a hug,\r\nand that always makes me feel better.
So I hear you successfully climbed one of those\ntowers. Most impressive...\c\nI mean, I’ve never attempted it, but I imagine it\nis very challenging...
I’d planned to be on my way once I completed\nmy training, but I ended up just hanging around.\c\nIt’s just so comfortable and calming here!
I want to become stronger than everyone else,\nbut I guess that means I have to work harder\r\nthan everyone else, too.\c\nEven if it’s super tedious![VAR 0114(0071)]
In order to defeat others, I need to first be able\nto defeat myself.\c\nI understand that now. In theory, anyway...[VAR 0114(0072)]
Hm? You have it holding an Everstone.\nThat must mean...[VAR 0114(0073)]
You can’t have Kubfu look at the scroll while it’s\nholding an Everstone!

Hop?! What’re you doing here?!
Oh, Hop. You’re here, too?
Surprise! And nicely done, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nThat’s just the reaction I was hoping for![VAR 0114(0005)]
Where’s the surprise, mate? The welcome?\nActing like I’m something the Meowth\r\ndragged in...[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m here on the Isle of Armor to research more\nabout the Dynamax phenomenon.[VAR 0114(0005)]
So, I hear that you two are friends!\nHow delightful![VAR 0114(0073)]
Hoppy-kins here was just asking my permission\nto camp out on the Isle of Armor...\c\nBut where’s the fun in mucking about\nin the mud?\c\nI was telling him he should stay here—\nat the dojo![VAR 0114(0073)]
I mean, it’d be loads easier than camping out\nfor a long while, but wouldn’t I be in the way?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Everybody’s welcome to wear out their welcome\nat the Master Dojo! Don’t be shy, my boy![VAR 0114(0073)]
Besides, we’re practically family already.\nYou’re the little brother of our Leon, after all![VAR 0114(0073)]
Yeah, it’s true—Lee did train here when we were\nboth kids...[VAR 0114(0005)]
All right then, Master Mustard.\nYou’ve twisted my arm!\r\nI hope you don’t regret it, because I’m staying![VAR 0114(0005)]
Whoo! The more the merrier!\nI’m pleased as punch in a gold-plated\r\npunch bowl![VAR 0114(0073)]
Which reminds me, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0073)]
I’ve got something I’ve been meaning to tell you\nabout Kubfu...or, really, its Evolution—Urshifu.[VAR 0114(0073)]
The truth is the lovable rascal is capable of\nGigantamaxing, too.[VAR 0114(0073)]
But it’s a bit tricky, because it really can’t\nstand the taste of Max Mushrooms.\c\nSo Max Soup is off the menu, unless you can\nmake it more appealing to it.[VAR 0114(0073)]
There’s a [VAR FF00(0006)]certain something[VAR FF00(0000)] you can find here on\nthe Isle of Armor, though, that’ll make even\r\nUrshifu gobble up a bowl of Max Soup...[VAR 0114(0073)]
And that [VAR FF00(0006)]certain something[VAR FF00(0000)] is...[VAR 0114(0073)]
That certain...something...is—?![VAR 0114(0005)]
That certain something...\c\nIt’s actually...[VAR 0114(0073)]
The suspense here is killing me...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Actually...I’ve forgotten what it is!\nOopsie-doopsie![VAR 0114(0073)]
Are you kidding me?! Noooooo![VAR 0114(0005)]
Mufufufu! You’re even more fun to tease than\nyour brother ever was![VAR 0114(0073)]
The [VAR FF00(0006)]certain something[VAR FF00(0000)] I’m thinking of is sure to\nmake Max Soup more palatable to Urshifu...\c\nand it has something to do with\nanother Pokémon![VAR 0114(0073)]
Now I think I’ll let the two of you figure out\njust what it is. Give it a good think together![VAR 0114(0073)]
You’re on your own, kiddos!\nThe world is your Cloyster, so get cracking![VAR 0114(0073)]
Is this, uh, how your training usually goes?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ve really got no Rapidash in this race, but even\nI’m pretty curious about that [VAR FF00(0006)]certain something[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
I think I read something about Urshifu in a book\nonce, too...[VAR 0114(0005)]
It’s the Wushu Pokémon, right? The book said it\nlives in the mountains in some far-off region.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Does it really?
That’s pretty amazing, Hop!
Huh? You didn’t know?\nDon’t you have one, [VAR 0100(0000)]?![VAR 0114(0005)]
Naw, it’s nothing. I just happened to be\nresearching foreign Pokémon lately is all![VAR 0114(0005)]
But yeah, I think I read that Urshifu is absolutely\nmad for some kind of [VAR FF00(0006)]sticky honey[VAR FF00(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nHoney is made from the nectar of flowers and\nplants, right?\c\nSo maybe we need nectar made by some\nPokémon that look like flowers and plants!\c\nAnd if we’re looking for those kinds of Pokémon,\nthen I’d reckon there might be lots in a forest.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll be able to look into Dynamaxing along\nthe way, so count me in for some exploration![VAR 0114(0005)]

Sonia and I split up places to survey. And she\nopted for the cold and snow—and all.\c\nToo bad we can’t somehow divide this heat up\nbetween us, too. We’d both feel a bit better![VAR 0114(0005)]
Anyway, I was checking out this Forest of Focus\nplace while I was waiting for you to show up...\c\nand I saw signs that [VAR FF00(0006)]Lilligant[VAR FF00(0000)] and [VAR FF00(0006)]Applin\n[VAR FF00(0000)]live here![VAR 0114(0005)]
Maybe we can gather a bit of sweet nectar that\nUrshifu should love from their flowers and fruit.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I reckon [VAR FF00(0006)]Lilligant[VAR FF00(0000)] and [VAR FF00(0006)]Applin[VAR FF00(0000)] are the most likely\nPokémon to produce any nectar here in the\r\nForest of Focus.\c\nLet’s see if they can’t spare a bit for Urshifu![VAR 0114(0005)]

Tili...
Look! It’s a Petilil![VAR 0114(0005)]
Petilil evolves into Lilligant, which is just the\nPokémon we’re looking for![VAR 0114(0005)]
Peh...
Hey, doesn’t that Petilil seem to be acting a\nbit strange?[VAR 0114(0005)]
It looks sort of sad
It looks a bit lost
Yeah, now that you mention it...[VAR 0114(0005)]
It’s still pretty little...\nMaybe it got separated from its parents?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Tilili!
Whoa! Who’re you glomming onto, mate?!\c\nYou really must be lost if you think\nI’m your mum![VAR 0114(0005)]
And now I’m stuck. OK...[VAR 0114(0005)]
You’ve gotta help us out here, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Go find us one of Petilil’s parents or something,\nwould you?\c\nLook for some worried-looking Lilligant![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll wait here with this little one. I’m afraid I’ll\nstep on it if I start walking around![VAR 0114(0005)]
Lilligant is a Pokémon that’s got this big flower\nblooming on its head. You can’t miss it!\c\nAnd we wanted to find one anyway, right?\nWe’re catching two Rookidee with one ball![VAR 0114(0005)]
Peh...

Lil...
Lilli?
We’ve got your Petilil!
Have you lost a Petilil?!
Liiigant!
Lilligant wants to follow you!
Lead it to where Hop and Petilil are waiting!
Finally, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nAnd you found Lilligant![VAR 0114(0005)]
Lilliii!
Tilil!
Hehe, looks like they’re both pretty happy to\nsee each other.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Gant tu!
What d’ya think, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nI’d say Lilligant is trying to thank you.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Lili!
Huh? Is this...some of the nectar from your\nflower, Lilligant?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Gant tuuu!
Til lil!
See ya, Petilil! See ya, Lilligant![VAR 0114(0005)]
Nice one, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nNow we’ve got some of Lilligant’s nectar![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hopefully this nectar’s sweet and sticky, just like\nUrshifu likes it...[VAR 0114(0005)]
*sluuurp*[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hrmmm...\nI definitely wouldn’t call it very sticky.\r\nIt’s pretty watery...[VAR 0114(0005)]
I don’t think this is what you need, mate, but\nat least we did a good deed anyway.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Come on! Let’s give Applin’s nectar a try next![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, you brought Lilligant?\c\nEr... No, you definitely did not.\nDid you lose it along the way, maybe?\r\nGo find it! My feet are falling asleep here![VAR 0114(0005)]

App?
There! It’s an Applin![VAR 0114(0005)]
Appawaaay!
Applin! No, wait![VAR 0114(0005)]
This is rotten...\nI don’t see that Applin anywhere![VAR 0114(0005)]
But I’m sure it went rolling off this way...[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]!\nWe’ve gotta find that Applin![VAR 0114(0005)]
Huh? Something wrong with that Berry tree?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Piiiiii!
Ouch!\nThe Applin clocked you right on the head!
Awaaaylin!
Augh! It ran off again![VAR 0114(0005)]
Huh? Uh, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nIs your head feeling a bit...moist?[VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s gotta be Applin’s nectar on you![VAR 0114(0005)]
It might’ve given us the slip, but at least we still\ngot what we came for![VAR 0114(0005)]
But is Applin’s nectar sweet enough for Urshifu?\c\nWell, like they say—the proof is in the pudding!\nOr the Applin! So let’s give it a try![VAR 0114(0005)]
*sluuurp*[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hrmmm...\nI don’t think you’d describe it as sticky exactly...\r\nIt’s more like juice or something...[VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 18]

Lilligant’s nectar wasn’t it...\nApplin’s nectar wasn’t it...[VAR 0114(0005)]
They weren’t really sticky enough to be\nthe sticky honey that Urshifu loves...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Come to think of it, they aren’t really honey\nat all, are they?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I was thinking nectar and honey were the same\nthing, so I was looking for plants and flowers.\r\nBut was I just barking up the wrong tree?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Pede.
Whoa, a Venipede!\nI don’t see one of those every day![VAR 0114(0005)]
It’s cute looking, right?\nBut it can produce a really thick, gooey poison\r\ninside its body—making it pretty dangerous.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Th...that’s it![VAR 0114(0005)]
I was stuck on Pokémon that produce nectar...\nBut what we really need is a Pokémon that USES\r\nthat sort of nectar to produce something else![VAR 0114(0005)]
Something like honey?!
You just noticed?!
Yes![VAR 0114(0005)]
And when it comes to Pokémon that collect and\nstore up lots of nectar to make honey...\c\nwell, the answer is obvious, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Sheep Pokémon!
Beehive Pokémon!
Er, no, that’d be Wooloo.\nIt might eat grass, but it can’t produce honey...[VAR 0114(0005)]
The Beehive Pokémon has got to be the answer!\nI’m sure of it this time![VAR 0114(0005)]
And Vespiquen is the Beehive Pokémon, right,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]? Have you ever seen one?[VAR 0114(0005)]
If we’re talking about the Isle of Armor...[VAR 0114(0005)]
I think we should find some on the [VAR FF00(0006)]island shaped[VAR FF00(0000)]\n[VAR FF00(0006)]like a honeycomb[VAR FF00(0000)] over near that big blue tower![VAR 0114(0005)]
Now that we know where we’re going, I’m off!\nDon’t make me wait, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There you are, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nGlad you could finally make it![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ve seen loads of Combee around, but no sign\nof Vespiquen so far...\r\nBut they’re the ones that’d have sticky honey.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Huh? I borrowed a Power Spot Detector from\nSonia, but why’s it going off now?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Is it...reacting to this tree here?[VAR 0114(0005)]

There’s a cloying smell of thick, rich honey\ncoming from the top of the tree!
Will you shake it?
Vvvvvvvvvrrrrrrrrrnnnnnn!
Wh-what is happening now?![VAR 0114(0005)]
*beep* *beep* *beep* *beep*
Gyargh?![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh bee haiiiiivvv!
Whatever it is that came from the tree sucks you\ninto the Pokémon Den!
The aftershocks of the battle caused a strange\ncomb of honey to fall from above!
I sure wasn’t expecting a Dynamaxed Vespiquen\nto come swooping out to attack us![VAR 0114(0005)]
I was too shocked to even think of joining you\nin the battle![VAR 0114(0005)]
That is some seriously sticky honey. I’m sure it’s\nthe [VAR FF00(0006)]certain something[VAR FF00(0000)] Urshifu loves![VAR 0114(0005)]
And it seems like that honey was setting off my\nPower Spot Detector, too.[VAR 0114(0005)]
The Max Mushrooms and this honey you can\nfind here on the Isle of Armor...\r\nthey both seem to have some kind of tie to\r\nDynamaxing and Gigantamaxing.[VAR 0114(0005)]
There’s tons we don’t yet know about it, so\nthere’s tons of research just waiting to be done.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Come on! You got the thing you were looking\nfor, so let’s head back to the dojo at once![VAR 0114(0005)]

Welcome back, my wandering Wooloo...[VAR 0114(0073)]
Oh, and what is that sweet scent I detect...\nwafting through the air around you?[VAR 0114(0073)]
Heh heh![VAR 0114(0005)]
That’d be the Max Honey that Urshifu loves to\nthe max!\r\nWe got our hands on a nice haul of it![VAR 0114(0005)]
Did you now?\nAlready?![VAR 0114(0073)]
You put me and [VAR 0100(0000)] on it, old man!\nThere’s nothing the two of us can’t do together![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hufufu! You did a real bang up job finding\nthat Max Honey with hardly a hint from me![VAR 0114(0073)]
Very nicely done, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nAnd our little Hop, too![VAR 0114(0073)]
You didn’t forget for a second what that\n“certain something” was, did you?[VAR 0114(0005)]
If we add Max Honey to our Max Soup, even\nUrshifu will be sure to want a sip!
Bearmor!
Urrrfu!
Well, it’s been real, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nBut I think you’ve learned just about everything\r\nthe Master Dojo has to teach you.[VAR 0114(0073)]
Which means that you and I can finally have a\nproper battle—with absolutely no holding back![VAR 0114(0073)]
I could use a bit of training if I’m going to be\nready for what’s to come, after all...[VAR 0114(0073)]
I won’t be pulling any punches this time, kiddo.\nIf you think you’re really ready for me when I’m\r\nserious, then come to the Battle Court out back![VAR 0114(0073)]
Battling the master when he’s serious...\nThat’s seriously terrifying.
He’s the one who taught Lee all he knows, so\nMustard’s got to be one wicked-strong Trainer![VAR 0114(0005)]
Course he is!\nSteel your spirit for serious battle, [VAR 0100(0000)]!
I guess I’d better start getting serious about the\nresearch I came here to do, too...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Good luck with your things, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nI’m sure you’ll manage—like you always do.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll come dashing right back to catch that battle,\nthough, if you do try taking on Master Mustard![VAR 0114(0005)]
I can make some Max Soup that even Kubfu’s\nEvolution, Urshifu, will drink.\c\nAs long as you’ve got both Max Honey and\nMax Mushrooms, that is.

Wait—Hop is Leon’s little brother? THAT Leon?!\c\nAnd you seem to be really friendly with him...\nWho ARE you, [VAR 0100(0000)]?
That innocent, pure smile of delight when Hop\nis happy about something is just so...\c\nAh! No! What am I thinking?!\nTwisted, vindictive Klara is the only one for me!
That innocent, pure smile of delight when Hop\nis happy about something is just so...\c\nAh! No! What am I thinking?!\nPompous, misguided Avery is the only one for me!
There’re rumors about some training method here\nat the Master Dojo that’s too hard for normal\r\npeople, so it’s kept secret...
I started thinking about which type I would\nevolve a Kubfu into.\c\nAnd before I knew it, the sun was going down,\nand I’d lost a whole day!
Want to hear something scary?\c\nThey say there’s a lady somewhere on the\nIsle of Armor who can take away all your\r\nPokémon’s training in the blink of an eye...
Hey, isn’t it about time for the next\nGym Challenge to begin?\c\nThe master is always hogging the TV, so we’re\nreally behind on the news out here...
That Hop really is something!\nOne of my Pokémon got injured, and he had it\r\nfixed right up in no time!
My mum’s latest letter said that Champion Leon\nhad retired!\c\nHonestly, she’s so not funny. Who would believe\na joke like that?
Hrmm?! There’s a certain tension in the air\nthat tells me a fierce battle is ready to begin!
If you’re looking for the master, I saw him head\nto the Battle Court out back, looking all\r\npleased about something...

Woo-hoo! Are you ready for another battle with\nlittle old me?[VAR 0114(0073)]
Oh, don’t leave me hanging like this!\nI’m just itching for a battle![VAR 0114(0073)]
Heh heh heh! That’s what I want to hear!\nThen let’s mosey on over to the battleground![VAR 0114(0073)]
You know, I’ve been thinking more and more\nthese days...[VAR 0114(0073)]
about how fortunate we were to have you join\nthe dojo...[VAR 0114(0073)]
even if it was by mistake at first![VAR 0114(0073)]
I can’t thank you enough, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0073)]
It’s been a while since I’ve been so excited!\nI can feel my blood burning and my heart just\r\ndancing with anticipation![VAR 0114(0073)]
I just can’t resist a battle against a worthy\nopponent—no matter how old I get![VAR 0114(0073)]
Now then...[VAR 0114(0073)]
Let’s get things going! This is the most fun time in\nthe world![VAR 0114(0073)]
Fuhaha! I held absolutely nothing back, and yet\nyou still defeated me![VAR 0114(0073)]
The apprentice surpasses h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser master...\nA true moment of pride for the master!\c\nYou deserve a very special League Card\nfrom me![VAR 0114(0073)]
It seems I will have to redo my own training\nfrom scratch![VAR 0114(0073)]
Oh, darling! Did I hear right?\nYou actually lost?![VAR 0114(0074)]
Ah, so you all came![VAR 0114(0073)]
You know I can’t resist seeing you get all serious\nabout battle, you cheeky thing!\c\nYou look utterly dashing, darling![VAR 0114(0074)]
Oh! But look at me getting all distracted...\nYou were amazing, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0074)]
Looks like we’ll need to have some Max Soup\ntonight to celebrate!
Well, I’m not surprised one bit, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nI knew you’d win![VAR 0114(0005)]
I knew you weren’t just a new student!\nI think I’ll call you Master Newbie from now on!
And you were fabulous, too, [VAR 0101(0001)]![VAR 0114(0074)]
Uraaa!
Bearmor!
Um, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0071)]
*ahem*\n[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0072)]
I-I just...well...\nI guess I should congratulate you...[VAR 0114(0071)]
Well, um, how should I put this...?\nI thought mayhap I should offer\r\nmy congratulations...[VAR 0114(0072)]
But I won’t!\nWhy should I celebrate anything you do, huh?![VAR 0114(0071)]
But I won’t! Honestly, I don’t see why I should\ncelebrate anything![VAR 0114(0072)]
Still, that cleared up a lot![VAR 0114(0071)]
I will admit...I do feel a bit better.[VAR 0114(0072)]
You’re strong enough to beat the master going\nall out! I never stood a chance![VAR 0114(0071)]
I couldn’t hold a candle to a Trainer who\ndefeated the master at his full strength![VAR 0114(0072)]
But the next time I face you...[VAR 0114(0071)]
But when next we meet on the field of battle...[VAR 0114(0072)]
I’ll take you on fair and square!\nAnd I won’t lose... You’ll see![VAR 0114(0071)]
it will be I who takes the victory...in a fair fight,\nno less![VAR 0114(0072)]
I don’t think I’ll lose!
Are you sure?
Agh! You’re downright infuriating—you know\nthat? Almost as bad as I am![VAR 0114(0071)]
Y-you’ve got quite the attitude!\nThough maybe it’s not as bad as mine...[VAR 0114(0072)]
Well, at least she’s aware of her own flaws...[VAR 0114(0074)]
Well, at least he’s aware of his own flaws...[VAR 0114(0074)]
Well, that wraps up the last of the training here\nat the Master Dojo![VAR 0114(0073)]
Oh, back to normal, huh, Master?[VAR 0114(0071)]
Oh, Master, I see you’re back to normal.[VAR 0114(0072)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0073)]
I hope you’ll come by and have more battles with\nme from time to time. It’ll make us both stronger![VAR 0114(0073)]
Just so we’re ready for when the time comes...[VAR 0114(0073)]
Heh heh! Oh, don’t worry! You’ll find out what\nI’m talking about eventually![VAR 0114(0073)]
Aaanyway, let’s all head back, shall we?\nLike one big family![VAR 0114(0073)]
Yeah!
[~ 53]
Wow, you’re eager to get the battle started!\nCome on, though—have a chat with me first![VAR 0114(0073)]
So, you’re the new Champion that beat Leon?!\nNo wonder you’re so strong, [VAR 0100(0000)]...
I’ve noticed Klara sneaking off somewhere these\ndays. She always comes back covered in sand.\r\nI wonder what she’s up to.
I’ve noticed Avery sneaking off somewhere these\ndays. He always comes back covered in sand.\r\nI wonder what he’s up to.
I’ve been told that it was Master Mustard who\ngave this island the name “Isle of Armor.”
You know those digging people you run into from\ntime to time here on the Isle of Armor?\c\nI wonder what they’re all about...
There’s a chance you’ll run into a\nChansey around here.\c\nIf you do, consider yourself lucky!\nYou can get tons of Exp. Points!
I never would’ve guessed you’re the new\nChampion! What do you say? Why not team up\r\nwith me so we can make lots of money?
That guy on soup duty... He’s up late at night,\nstudying the path of soup!\c\nThis is a dojo where people train to get stronger,\nbut I guess it’s OK if soup has become\r\nhis passion!
Is it true that Leon’s retired from being Champion?!\nAnd the new Champion’s standing right here...\r\nThat’s too much news for me to handle!
What do you seek—strength or having fun?\c\nIt doesn’t matter, really. You’ll find both\nwith Pokémon.
Did you know that Master Mustard was the\nChampion back in the day?!\c\nWhat’s he doing running a dojo on this\nlittle island?

She mentioned wantin’ to have a gander at\nsomeplace called the [VAR FF00(0006)]Max Lair[VAR FF00(0000)], didn’t she?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Sounds to me like she wants good old Papa to\nchase after her! Well, she needn’t worry—\r\nI’m not one for wastin’ time![VAR 0114(0076)]
Which means it’s time I got a move on.\nCheers for a fine battle![VAR 0114(0076)]

Aha! This must be the Max Lair that Nia was\ntalking about.[VAR 0114(0076)]
Which means my darlin’ daughter is in there\nright now, havin’ a giggle with some rare\r\nDynamax Pokémon![VAR 0114(0076)]
Hm? Oh, it’s you again!\nWell, kid, maybe you ought to come as well![VAR 0114(0076)]

Please, sir! I can’t let you—
Oh, I think you can!\c\nMy precious daughter’s in there, and I’m goin’\nin after her![VAR 0114(0076)]
I understand, sir, but—
But what?!\c\nI’m here to have an adventure, and I want to\nkick it off right now![VAR 0114(0076)]
I simply can’t allow it, sir!
Grrr![VAR 0114(0076)]
Oh, there you are, lad!\nSo you’ve come after all, have you?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Oh, there you are, lass!\nSo you’ve come after all, have you?[VAR 0114(0076)]
All right?
Something the matter?
Nothin’s all right, and everythin’s the matter![VAR 0114(0076)]
This ultra-mega-numpty of a scientist insists on\ngettin’ in my way![VAR 0114(0076)]
“Numpty of a—”? I beg your pardon, sir!
If you’d be so good as to simply listen, I could\nlet you through!
Dynamax Adventures are quite fraught with peril,\nI’m afraid, and—
Gaaah! I’ve got no patience for standin’ here\nlistenin’ to you rattle off the fine print![VAR 0114(0076)]
*sigh*\nWe’re just going round in circles.
You seem to know this gentleman.\nWould you simply listen to my explanation?
If so, then I could allow the two of you to enter\nas a pair.
Aha! Now you’re talkin’![VAR 0114(0076)]
Go on, then.\nLet’s hear what the good lady’s got to say!\c\nAnd then we’ll go find my little Nia together!\nRight? Right![VAR 0114(0076)]

Come on, mate! Don’t leave me hangin’![VAR 0114(0076)]
Please pay the gentleman no mind.\nCome and speak to me when you’re prepared.
That’s what I like to hear, mate!\nI owe you one![VAR 0114(0076)]
Very well. Then I will proceed.
The Max Lair is a labyrinthine underground\ncavern where rare Pokémon dwell—the likes\r\nof which normally are not found in the\r\nGalar region.
[~ 8]
[~ 9]
To avoid the risk of Galar particle overexposure,\nwhich can cause your own dear Pokémon to\r\nlose control...
we have prepared Pokémon for you that are\nresistant to the particles’ effects.
Right, right—I follow you!\c\nYou’re sayin’ you don’t want Galar losin’ control,\nso the Pokémon rent some particles,\r\nand we might see a rare overexposure![VAR 0114(0076)]
That was stunningly incorrect, sir.
This is a dangerous place. Please make sure\nyou’ve a firm grasp of the rules.
I’m still a touch lost, but...that’s the type of\nplace this is, eh?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Right!\nSounds like this is all a bit beyond me, so I’ll just\r\ngo on in and get crackin’![VAR 0114(0076)]
Here comes Papa, my darling Niaaa![VAR 0114(0076)]
Sir! No! I’ve just told you it’s too dangerous!
What is going on with that man?\nHe looks so much like Chairman Rose, but his\r\nattitude doesn’t match the chairman’s at all...
Well, when you’re ready to go chase him down—\n*sigh*\c\nPardon me. I meant, when you’re ready to begin\nyour Dynamax Adventure, please let me know.

So is my dad on his way here, too?\nI haven’t seen him... Has he got turned around\r\nand wound up back at the entrance?[VAR 0114(0078)]

What? You held your own against my old man?![VAR 0114(0078)]
He used to be a Gym Leader, you know.\nEven on holiday, he’s no pushover![VAR 0114(0078)]
Y’know, my dad was going mad with\nexcitement for this trip.[VAR 0114(0078)]
He kept going on about how he’d planned\nfor us to check out local legends on this\r\nsuper-intense adventure tour—or “Adven-tour”\r\nas he calls it...[VAR 0114(0078)]
But I mean, come on! What girl my age would be\ncaught dead doing some naff thing like that\r\nwith her dad?[VAR 0114(0078)]
Besides, I really fancy having more battles with\nDynamax Pokémon![VAR 0114(0078)]
Ahhh, the thrill of battling one of those massive,\ntowering Pokémon...\r\nJust thinking about it gets me pumped! Hee hee![VAR 0114(0078)]
You know what? I’ve just had a thought!\nYou’re a pretty fierce Trainer, right?[VAR 0114(0078)]
Then I bet you could handle takin’ my place on\nmy old man’s Adven-tour![VAR 0114(0078)]
Sounds like great fun!
Rather not, thanks
Too right it does! It’s a brilliant idea, if I do\nsay so myself![VAR 0114(0078)]
Oh, no need to worry!\nHe’ll take good care of you...despite all\r\nappearances to the contrary.[VAR 0114(0078)]
He’s so hyped up about all this. It’d be a shame\nto just leave him on his own.[VAR 0114(0078)]
And who knows? You could end up running into\na Legendary Pokémon![VAR 0114(0078)]
How about I meet back up with you two after\nI’ve had my own fun in the Max Lair?[VAR 0114(0078)]

Agh! It hurts! It ultra-mega-hurts!\nNia! Where’s my darlin’ Niaaa?[VAR 0114(0076)]
What happened?
Are you all right?
This fine gentleman appears to have tripped on\na rock and struck his head.
Hnngh...\nAdventures aren’t to be taken lightly.\r\nI’ve learned that firsthead now—\r\nFirsthand, I mean.[VAR 0114(0076)]
I was just checkin’ to see if my little girl\nwas behind some rocks, and look how I’ve\r\nended up![VAR 0114(0076)]
Behind some rocks? Is your daughter a\nRolycoly, sir?
There we go—I’m up! No little bump’s gonna\nkeep me down long. That kip’s got me feelin’\r\nright as rain![VAR 0114(0076)]

How about it then, lass? Did you find my\ndarlin’ Nia?[VAR 0114(0076)]
I did, but...
Well, here’s how it went...
Hmmm... You don’t say.[VAR 0114(0076)]
So dear Nia’s set on stayin’ away till she’s had\nher fill of this Dynamax Adventure stuff...[VAR 0114(0076)]
and she wants the two of us to go ahead and get\ncrackin’ on the grand Peony Adven-tour?[VAR 0114(0076)]
You know, I burned the candle at both ends\nworking out the best itinerary I could for my\r\ndear Nia’s sake...[VAR 0114(0076)]
But I guess she’s at that age when she doesn’t\nwant her old man taggin’ along all the time.[VAR 0114(0076)]
And tryin’ to press her into doin’ what I wanna\ndo probably won’t win me any “dad of the\r\nyear” awards.[VAR 0114(0076)]
Right, then!\nWhat’s your name, kid?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Cheers, [VAR 0100(0000)]! My name’s Peony!\nWait—have I already told you so? Gahaha!\r\nThen it’s twice as nice to meet you![VAR 0114(0076)]
Let’s have ourselves such a smashin’ adventure\nthat my dear Nia’ll be itchin’ to join in the fun![VAR 0114(0076)]
Yes, let’s!
Erm...
Now that’s an ultra-mega-great response!\nJust what I was hopin’ to hear! Gahaha![VAR 0114(0076)]
Gahaha! Don’t fret, now!\nI’ve done all sorts of preparations already![VAR 0114(0076)]
We’re goin’ to have ourselves a real treat of a\nLegendary Pokémon hunt![VAR 0114(0076)]
So that’s decided!\nNow then, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0076)]
Let’s get ourselves to Freezington! It’s a town\njust a short ways off.\c\nTime for a strategic plannin’ meetin’ for\nPeony’s Adven-tour![VAR 0114(0076)]
I’ll fill you in on the details once you get there!\nI say, let us reconvene posthaste![VAR 0114(0076)]
Ha! Just pullin’ your leg.\nCan you imagine if I actually talked like that?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Gahaaahahaha![VAR 0114(0076)]
What a...unique fellow.\nUniquely boisterous to be sure.
Please do hurry and meet your friend in\nFreezington as he asked...\r\nbefore he decides to come back.

Hello, hello! What have we here?\nAnother visitor?[VAR 0114(0042)]
I am the mayor of this fair town of Freezington.[VAR 0114(007A)]
I must say, it’s a surprise to have visitors arriving\nin our out-of-the-way town one after another.[VAR 0114(007A)]
Might you be here to learn about the legend of\n[VAR FF00(0006)]the King of Bountiful Harvests[VAR FF00(0000)] as well?[VAR 0114(007A)]
Ah, never mind.\nIt hardly bears asking.[VAR 0114(007A)]
After all, there’s very little otherwise to attract\nvisitors to our sleepy corner of the region.[VAR 0114(007A)]
Which is a bit of a shame, really...[VAR 0114(007A)]
People come all this way to investigate what\nturns out to be a mere fairy tale.[VAR 0114(007A)]
But since you’ve made the journey, I must offer\nyou this Freezington specialty as a memento![VAR 0114(007A)]
You got [VAR 1302(0001,0000)][VAR 01C2(0001)] [VAR FF00(0008)][VAR 01C1(0002)][VAR FF00(0000)]!
It’s a shirt emblazoned with the likeness of\nthe King of Bountiful Harvests.\c\nI’m afraid it hasn’t sold quite as well as we’d\nhoped. We’ve got a fair number left over...[VAR 0114(007A)]
The illustration’s based on extremely ancient\naccounts of the king’s appearance.\r\nHence the unusually sized head.[VAR 0114(007A)]
But we thought it might make the design a touch\nmore “hip,” as they say...[VAR 0114(007A)]
If you’d like to see what the king really looked\nlike, I suggest you take a look at the statue by\r\nthe fields in the center of our village.[VAR 0114(007A)]
By the by, while you’re here in the Crown Tundra,\nfeel free to let your lead Pokémon out of its\r\nball and [VAR FF00(0001)]take it for a stroll[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(007A)]
Farewell for now, then.[VAR 0114(007A)]

Aha! Here you are![VAR 0114(0076)]
This poky little place will be our lodgings![VAR 0114(0076)]
But as of this moment, it’s also somethin’\nfar more important—our base camp![VAR 0114(0076)]
I know, I know. Not much of a base camp, is it?\nStill, we’ve got to give it a proper air of\r\nimportance, haven’t we?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Now, enough faffin’ about, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nLet me tell you what the Peony Exploration\r\nTeam is after![VAR 0114(0076)]
Round here, they’ve got a fair few strange and\nmysterious legends![VAR 0114(0076)]
FOR EXAMPLE![VAR 0114(0076)]
A huge-headed Pokémon known as the\nKing of Bountiful Harvests![VAR 0114(0076)]
NOT TO MENTION![VAR 0114(0076)]
A massive red tree where legendary flyin’\nPokémon gather![VAR 0114(0076)]
AND FURTHERMORE![VAR 0114(0076)]
These great, hulkin’ dot-faced giants that\nsleep in some ruins or somethin’![VAR 0114(0076)]
ET CETERA![VAR 0114(0076)]
See what I mean? This place is just burstin’\nwith juicy legends![VAR 0114(0076)]
And we’re not stoppin’ until we’ve found just\nhow much truth they’ve got to ’em![VAR 0114(0076)]
And there you have it!\nWe are the Peony Exploration Team...[VAR 0114(0076)]
and that is our grand, noble, magnificent goal![VAR 0114(0076)]
Course, if I had my way, I’d be doin’ this with my\ndarlin’ Nia...[VAR 0114(0076)]
But who knows? They say even Chansey meetings\ncan lead to Blissey-ful friendships![VAR 0114(0076)]
So here’s to a grand adventure,\nExpedition Chief [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0076)]
Chief?
Who, me?
Obviously![VAR 0114(0076)]
Look... What do you think would happen if the\ntwo of us went gallivantin’ off together?[VAR 0114(0076)]
My dear Nia could come along for a grand,\nemotional reunion...and find this place empty![VAR 0114(0076)]
Just the thought of it... My own darlin’ daughter,\nsittin’ alone in this room, pinin’ for her papa...[VAR 0114(0076)]
Gaaah! Nope, not on my watch!\nI’d never let that happen![VAR 0114(0076)]
So I’ll be the hold-down-the-fort chief![VAR 0114(0076)]
Which means you get the pleasure of bein’\nthe expedition chief! Gahaha![VAR 0114(0076)]
Which brings me to...this! Go on—have it![VAR 0114(0076)]
You got an [VAR FF00(0008)]Expedition Uniform[VAR FF00(0000)]!
Gahaha! Look at that. Fits you like a glove![VAR 0114(0076)]
I brought some spare uniforms so my dear Nia\nwould have a few to change into.\r\nSo there’s enough to give you one![VAR 0114(0076)]
And if you ever need to change or have a kip,\nby all means...[VAR 0114(0076)]
just head into the bedroom back here![VAR 0114(0076)]
I’ve got some different-colored scarves in there,\nso switch it up if you fancy a bit of style![VAR 0114(0076)]
Here—have these, too![VAR 0114(0076)]
They’re Legendary Clues I’ve meticulously\ncompiled from hours of dedicated\r\ntelly watchin’![VAR 0114(0076)]
First off, why not have a look at that clue\nabout the King of Bountiful Harvests?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Seems like this king’s bonds with its loyal steed—\nor whatever you call it—run proper deep!\r\nSo if I had to name this expedition, I’d call it...[VAR 0114(0076)]
There’s a great, big statue of it bang in the\nmiddle of the village!\c\nThough its head isn’t as massive as in\nmy notes...[VAR 0114(0076)]
Do you want to change back into your\nusual clothes?
All set!\c\nTime to investigate the legends surrounding\nthe Crown Tundra!
No need to change!\c\nTime to investigate the legends surrounding\nthe Crown Tundra!
Aha! I’ve just had an idea.\nHere’s a little somethin’ to help you out![VAR 0114(0076)]
This is supposed to be one ultra-mega-corker of\na ball! Use it wherever you think you ought to![VAR 0114(0076)]
I got it ages ago from somebody I used to know.\nNever could bring myself to use it, though...[VAR 0114(0076)]
If you ever get a bit turned around,\ncome on back to base camp anytime![VAR 0114(0076)]
You can’t miss it—just look for the adventurin’-\ncrew flag I stuck out front!\r\nHandmade by yours truly![VAR 0114(0076)]
Anyway, I suppose that’s that!\nLet the grand adventure begin!\r\nHave a smashin’ time out there![VAR 0114(0076)]

If you can put your head on it and have a kip,\nit’s a pillow![VAR 0114(0076)]
Unfortunately, I went and left my favorite pillow\nback at home.[VAR 0114(0076)]
So I went to have a look around town for\nsomethin’ to rest my head on...\r\nand I found this out back behind the inn![VAR 0114(0076)]

That’s askin’ a lot, even comin’ from you, Chief![VAR 0114(0076)]
Hm? What’s that?[VAR 0114(0076)]
You think my pillow’s got somethin’ to do with\na Legendary Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Gaaah, ultra-mega-seriously?!\nThis is just some old thing I found![VAR 0114(0076)]
But if you really want it, Chief...\nWho am I to refuse?[VAR 0114(0076)]
All right, all right! Go on, then—have it![VAR 0114(0076)]

I hope he doesn’t mind that I make use of it for\nthe time being.[VAR 0114(0077)]
Chief Peony?
Are you the Pokémon?
An understandable reaction, but the answer\nis no.[VAR 0114(0077)]
Oh? I see you have grasped the situation\nalready. Very astute of you![VAR 0114(0077)]
I am Calyrex. I am the one known as the King of\nBountiful Harvests.[VAR 0114(0079)]
I have borrowed this man’s body in order to\nthank you in person...so to speak.[VAR 0114(0079)]
Indeed, there are no words to adequately\nexpress my gratitude toward you for restoring\r\nmy statue.[VAR 0114(0079)]
In days long past, I reigned over these lands\nas king.[VAR 0114(0079)]
The humans offered me their loyalty and respect,\nas I was able to bring lush vegetation to\r\nthe land and give them plentiful harvests\r\nyear after year.[VAR 0114(0079)]
However, it seems that over many, many years,\nthe people of this land have forgotten\r\nmy existence.[VAR 0114(0079)]
They used to make offerings to me every year,\nbut even that tradition has long since been lost\r\nto the ravages of time.[VAR 0114(0079)]
You see, it is the faith of the people that grants\nme strength...[VAR 0114(0079)]
And now I have lost all but a fraction of my\nformer power. Even my loyal steed has\r\nabandoned me...[VAR 0114(0079)]
However, you were kind enough to restore\nmy statue![VAR 0114(0079)]
That act has returned some strength to me,\nat least enough to speak to you by borrowing\r\nthe body of another.[VAR 0114(0079)]
Now, kindhearted human child...\nI have a favor to ask of you.[VAR 0114(0079)]
[~ 42]
I must know once and for all whether the people\nhave truly forgotten about me.[VAR 0114(0079)]

I wish you to speak to the villagers and ask if\nthey remember the King of Bountiful Harvests.[VAR 0114(0079)]
I have tried asking them myself, you understand.\c\nBut they treated me like some sort of fairy-tale\ncreature or flew into a mild panic at the sight\r\nof me...[VAR 0114(0079)]
Please, kindhearted human.\nI beg you to help me...[VAR 0114(0079)]

The King of Bountiful Harvests?\c\nWell, if it exists, why doesn’t it heal the\nland around here so we can grow crops\r\nfor a change?
You want to know about the King of Bountiful\nHarvests? All I can tell you is its name. I think it\r\nwas called Calvin! Or was it Calista?
The Pokémon king?\c\nOh, sure, my gran used to tell me stories about it\nall the time when I was a kid.\r\nAn old fairy tale, that...
The King of Bountiful Harvests?\c\nI used to believe it was real, you know? I was\ntold that if I made mischief in the fields, the\r\nking would steal my body away.
Oh dear, I’m sorry.\nI’m rather busy doing nothing right now.
Do I remember the King of Bountiful Harvests?\nWhy, of course I do!\c\nIt’s only the main tourist attraction of our lovely\nFreezington, after all!\c\nI imagine we would see more visitors if only the\nking were real...[VAR 0114(007A)]
I would like you to ask the people of the village\nif they remember the King of Bountiful Harvests.[VAR 0114(0079)]

You’ve asked the people of Freezington about\nthe King of Bountiful Harvests!
Time to report back to Calyrex!

Text File : rigel2_main_0114

Ah, human child! I trust you were able to speak\nto the villagers.[VAR 0114(0079)]
So, how was it?\nDid they say anything about me?[VAR 0114(0079)]
They did, but...
Just that you were a fairy tale...
Hmm... It is as I suspected. Nobody truly believes\nthat I am real.[VAR 0114(0079)]
It seems the people of this land have indeed\nforgotten the bond they once shared with me...[VAR 0114(0079)]
Hm? Oh, no, of course I am not grieving![VAR 0114(0079)]
I am the King of Bountiful Harvests, after all!\nI know better than to count on humans to\r\nremember me.[VAR 0114(0079)]
This proves beyond doubt that I cannot simply\nrely on human faith if I want my powers\r\nto return.[VAR 0114(0079)]
If only my loyal steed were to return to me, I\nwould regain something of what I’ve lost...[VAR 0114(0079)]
Your loyal steed?
Is that a Pokémon?
Yes! The four-legged Pokémon that I used to\nride all across the land.[VAR 0114(0079)]
The very same Pokémon that my statue in the\nvillage shows me riding.[VAR 0114(0079)]
Alas, though in ancient times we spent many days\ntogether, dashing through the valleys and over\r\nthe mountains of this land...[VAR 0114(0079)]
my power waned, and I was forced to part ways\nwith it. Now, I know not where it may be.[VAR 0114(0079)]
Even if we should succeed in locating my\nloyal steed, I have my doubts as to whether it\r\nhas remained...well, loyal.\c\nI have lost so much power...[VAR 0114(0079)]
Perhaps the villagers know something about my...\ncurrently not-so-loyal steed.\c\nI would be in your debt if you could speak to the\nhead of the village on my behalf.[VAR 0114(0079)]
If you are able to find any information at all, I\nask that you let me know...[VAR 0114(0079)]
*snort*\nGah?![VAR 0114(0076)]
Huh?! Chief?! With a massive noggin!\nOr... Wait. No, it’s normal.[VAR 0114(0076)]
I must’ve fallen asleep where I stood!\nSorry ’bout that, Chief![VAR 0114(0076)]
Still, I feel strange.\nLike my body’s not quite my own...[VAR 0114(0076)]
Guess I’ll head back to base and get some rest!\n’Sides, it’s freezing out here![VAR 0114(0076)]
You want to know about the loyal steed of the\nKing of Bountiful Harvests?\c\nWell, I’ve been told it was once a belligerent\nruffian that would ruin all our harvests.\r\nDoesn’t sound like something I’d get along with!
The king’s loyal steed? Loyal steed, hm...\c\nYou know, that reminds me—I know a lawyer\nnamed Steve in Motostoke. I wonder what\r\nlawyer Steve is up to these days?
I heard that the king’s loyal steed had a beautiful\nfur coat that was as dark as night.
The king’s loyal steed? I was told that it had a\nwondrous fur coat that was as white as\r\nuntouched snow!
The king’s loyal steed is said to have had a\nfavorite food. I can’t remember for the life of\r\nme what it was.\c\nThe mayor knows a lot about the old legends\nlike that.

The mayor’s not home at the moment.
He went to have a look at the fields in the\nGiant’s Bed.
You can go look for him if you’re in a hurry.
The fields in the Giant’s Bed are to the\nsoutheast of the village.\c\nGo through Frostpoint Field and just keep going\nto the left.

Alas, this field is no good, either...[VAR 0114(007A)]
The soil is barren... No crop could possibly grow\nhere now.[VAR 0114(007A)]
Perhaps the lands of the Crown Tundra truly are\nbeyond hope...[VAR 0114(007A)]
What’s this? Oh, our dear visitor!\nWhat brings you here?[VAR 0114(007A)]
Hmm? You want to learn about the loyal steed\nof the King of Bountiful Harvests?[VAR 0114(007A)]
Well, this is hardly the place for storytelling.[VAR 0114(007A)]
Come to my home in Freezington. It’s better to\nhave a nice chat in the warmth, after all![VAR 0114(007A)]
Please visit whenever you’re ready. I’ll be waiting![VAR 0114(007A)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Have you seen what’s happened to the statue of\nthe King of Bountiful Harvests? Its head has\r\nbecome massive![VAR 0114(007A)]
Hmm? You say that’s the way the king’s\nsupposed to look?[VAR 0114(007A)]
Now that you mention it, it does resemble the\ndesign on our town’s souvenir shirts...\c\nBut you speak as if you’ve seen the king with\nyour own two eyes![VAR 0114(007A)]
That statue’s been broken since I was a child...[VAR 0114(007A)]

Well, I don’t know why you’d be interested\nin such things, but... Come, then. Follow me.[VAR 0114(007A)]
An old book I read long ago said that the king’s\nloyal steed was particularly fond of a certain\r\nspecial vegetable...[VAR 0114(007A)]
But my memory isn’t what it used to be. I can’t\nrecall what exactly the steed so desired![VAR 0114(007A)]
I think it best that you search on the bookshelf\nover there if you want to find out any more.[VAR 0114(007A)]

Huh?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Mlerrrgh...[VAR 0114(0076)]
Human child! Were you able to find something\nout about my loyal steed?[VAR 0114(0079)]
Ah, that is unfortunate... Should you find out\nanything, I ask that you let me know.[VAR 0114(0079)]
You say you found out about something that my\nloyal steed could not resist?![VAR 0114(0079)]
It has been so long since we rode together that\nI had completely forgotten...[VAR 0114(0079)]
With this information, we may be able to lure\nmy loyal steed to me yet! So tell me—what is it\r\nthat my loyal steed would find so irresistible?[VAR 0114(0079)]
The Reins of Unity
Carrots
The Freezington Snow Samba
The Freezington’s Fame shirt
Never mind—I don’t know...
Hmm... The Reins of Unity, you say?\c\n’Tis true that they would help me regain the link\nwith my loyal steed, but it has been many years\r\nsince the humans made a new set of reins for me.\r\nI doubt we shall be able to obtain them now.[VAR 0114(0079)]
The...Freezington Snow Samba?\c\nI did see the villagers performing a strange dance\nsome years ago, but it was hardly irresistible.\c\nIn fact, I imagine even a Greedent would lose its\nappetite after one look at such an odd display.[VAR 0114(0079)]
Ah yes. The garment with my image on it.\c\nI suspect that even a poor facsimile of my visage\nwould be enough to send my loyal steed running.\c\nIts loyalty is not what it used to be...[VAR 0114(0079)]
Oho! Carrots, you say![VAR 0114(0079)]
Yes, yes, I remember now... Even back when we\nwere together, it would leap at any chance to\r\neat some kind of crop. It took everything I had\r\nto restrain it![VAR 0114(0079)]
Looking back, the crop must have been carrots!\nI am in your debt, human child![VAR 0114(0079)]
What we must do now is clear. If we are able to\nfind carrots somewhere, it should be but a trifle\r\nto lure my loyal steed back to me![VAR 0114(0079)]
I wonder... Do the humans of the village grow\nany carrots?[VAR 0114(0079)]
If we could obtain even a single seed, I could\ngrow a carrot from it myself...[VAR 0114(0079)]
I wonder... Do the humans of the village grow\nany carrots?\c\nIf we could obtain even a single seed, I could\ngrow a carrot from it myself...[VAR 0114(0079)]
We don’t grow carrots in this village anymore.\nIt’s a shame...
[~ 25]
I’ve got plenty of potatoes back home, but I\nhaven’t seen carrots in a long time.\c\nStill, I’m sure somebody has some seeds, at least.
The Crown Tundra used to be well-known for the\ntwo types of carrots that were grown here.\c\nWe don’t grow them anymore, though.

Welcome to Freezington. It must have been quite\na journey to get here.
The Crown Tundra is famous for carrots, you\nknow. Maybe you’d be interested in getting\r\nsome Carrot Seeds as a souvenir?
Yes, please!
Uh, I’m good...
Hohoho! Quite the enthusiastic one, aren’t you?
Now now, no need to be shy!
Though I must admit, these seeds are rather\nvaluable to us...
How about a trade? You bring me [VAR 0200(0001)] piece[VAR 1101(0001,0100)]s of\nDynite Ore, and I’ll give you the seeds.
Hoho! Life is all about quid pro go—or whatever\nthe phrase was!
Do you want to trade [VAR 0200(0001)] piece[VAR 1101(0001,0100)]s of Dynite Ore\nfor the Carrot Seeds?
Well, the seeds aren’t going anywhere.\nCome back if you want to trade!
I appreciate the enthusiasm, but you don’t have\nenough Dynite Ore.
You handed over [VAR 0200(0001)] piece[VAR 1101(0001,0100)]s of Dynite Ore!
Oh, wonderful! This is plenty! Now we can bury\nthe ore in our fields and make our crops huge!
Here are the seeds, as promised!
Don’t go planting those seeds I gave you\nwilly-nilly in the village’s fields, now!\r\nThese fields are for our own crops!
Oh, you’re looking for carrots?\c\nWell, you won’t be finding any this time of year.\nWe do have seeds right here...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : rigel2_main_0128

Have you found the carrots, human child?[VAR 0114(0079)]
By the stars![VAR 0114(0079)]
You say that you have Carrot Seeds? That\nstrange bag contains the seeds of carrots?[VAR 0114(0079)]
You humans never stop adapting and evolving.\nI am constantly amazed by your ingenuity.[VAR 0114(0079)]
And yet... Hmm.\nThe fields of the village simply won’t do.\r\nThey’re not suited for growing carrots.[VAR 0114(0079)]
If we could find rich soil, I could use my powers\nto grow the crops we need![VAR 0114(0079)]
Now...where might we find soil suited for growing\nthese crops in this tundra of mine?[VAR 0114(0079)]
Ah, I see two spots that might suit our needs.\nOne is a field covered in pristine snow.[VAR 0114(0079)]
Another spot is a field by gravestones, where\nthose who moved on were laid to rest.[VAR 0114(0079)]
Either of those locations should allow me to use\nmy powers and grow the carrots we need.[VAR 0114(0079)]
Please, I ask that you choose a field and plant\nthose seeds![VAR 0114(0079)]
*snort*\nGah?![VAR 0114(0076)]
What in the—? I seem to be gettin’ in the habit\nof fallin’ asleep outside![VAR 0114(0076)]
Gahaha! I guess it just goes to show that holdin’\ndown the fort isn’t all that easy![VAR 0114(0076)]
You take care o’ yourself, Chief.\nDon’t overdo it![VAR 0114(0076)]
You marked the two fields Calyrex told you\nabout on your Town Map!

It’s one of the fields Calyrex told you about!
Do you want to plant the Carrot Seeds in\nthis field?
I see you have reached one of the fields.[VAR 0114(0079)]
Are you truly ready to plant the Carrot Seeds?[VAR 0114(0079)]
If you plant the seeds in this field,\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Iceroot Carrots[VAR FF00(0000)] will grow.\c\nIt has been so long that my memory is hazy,\nbut I believe that my loyal steed would often\r\npartake of this sort of vegetable.\c\nIf Iceroot Carrots were what my steed preferred,\nit must have been [VAR FF00(0006)]Ice type[VAR FF00(0000)], mustn’t it?\c\nIt’s most vexing that I can’t recall.

If you plant the seeds in this field,\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Shaderoot Carrots[VAR FF00(0000)] will grow.\c\nIt has been so long that my memory is hazy,\nbut I believe that my loyal steed would often\r\npartake of this sort of vegetable.\c\nIf Shaderoot Carrots were what my steed\npreferred, it must have been [VAR FF00(0006)]Ghost type[VAR FF00(0000)],\r\nmustn’t it?\c\nIt’s most vexing that I can’t recall. I suppose\nwe will see.[VAR 0114(0079)]
I will ask but once more...\nAre you sure this is the field in which you want\r\nto plant the seeds?[VAR 0114(0079)]
So you wish to reconsider?\c\nVery well... I shall return once you have made\nyour choice.[VAR 0114(0079)]
Very well. Then I ask that you plant the seeds.[VAR 0114(0079)]

But soon it will be time to bid my\nsorrow farewell![VAR 0114(0079)]
Now, human child. I must ask that you pull that\nIceroot Carrot free with all your might![VAR 0114(0079)]

Now all I need are the Reins of Unity.\nThey will amplify my power, letting me ride my\r\nloyal steed with ease.[VAR 0114(0079)]

Shrrrrerrrm... Shrrrerrm...
It is my belief that while my steed picked up on\nthe scent of the carrot, it could not determine\r\nwhere the scent was coming from.[VAR 0114(0079)]
Judging from the direction it ran off in, it must\nbe headed to the village, in an attempt to\r\npillage carrots there![VAR 0114(0079)]
If that is true, then Freezington is in danger!\nHuman child, we must make haste![VAR 0114(0079)]
I-I won’t let a ruffian like that do anything to my\nprecious fields!
Please help! There’s a Pokémon threatening\nour village!
That Pokémon... Is it the one from the\nfairy tales?!
A huge Pokémon like that could lay waste to our\nwhole village!\c\nPlease! Someone! Anyone! Get it to settle down!
Now, I wonder what all that commotion is about.\nIs it festival season already?
My loyal steed is endangering the villagers!\nBut I am too weak...\c\nPlease, human child! I beg you!\nSave the village![VAR 0114(0079)]

Y-yes...\nI feel like something stepped in to save me...
Oh, kind visitor! How could I possibly thank you\nenough for saving the people of this village?[VAR 0114(007A)]
I had no idea such a vicious Pokémon still existed\nin the tundra...[VAR 0114(007A)]
Why, it reminded me of that Pokémon in the\nfairy tales... The loyal steed of the king...[VAR 0114(007A)]
Ah, but no doubt I am overthinking things.[VAR 0114(007A)]
Hmm? What is that you have there?\nIs that a tuft of White Mane Hair?[VAR 0114(007A)]
Hmm? What is that you have there?\nIs that a tuft of Black Mane Hair?[VAR 0114(007A)]
In the fairy tales, it is said that by weaving the\nhair of the loyal steed together with a [VAR FF00(0006)]radiant[VAR FF00(0000)]\r\n[VAR FF00(0006)]blossom[VAR FF00(0000)] grown by the king...[VAR 0114(007A)]
it is possible to create the Reins of Unity, which\nlink the king with its steed![VAR 0114(007A)]
In fact, it was my own ancestors who used to\nweave the Reins of Unity, following an ancient\r\ntradition passed down over many years.[VAR 0114(007A)]
Of course, I myself have never seen any kind of\nradiant flower, and the method of making the\r\nreins has also been lost to time.[VAR 0114(007A)]
In any case, we can’t spend all day musing over\nfairy tales![VAR 0114(007A)]
I must make plans and preparations. That\nPokémon could well decide to pay us another\r\nvisit, after all![VAR 0114(007A)]
Thank you very much for your help, kind traveler![VAR 0114(007A)]
Hey...\nThanks for saving us.
Was that Pokémon really the one from the fairy\ntales? It looked very similar to be sure, but...
Thank goodness you happened to pass by!\nYou really saved the day!
When that Pokémon was about to run into us,\nI just got this feeling that...some other Pokémon\r\nwearing a crown stepped in to save us.
Things have quieted down.\nI guess the festival’s over now?

But weakened as I am now, the most I could do\nwas influence its will and make it depart.[VAR 0114(0079)]

It has been many centuries since I was able to\ngrow a radiant flower. Doing so drains much of\r\nmy power.[VAR 0114(0079)]
But for whatever reason, a fraction of my power\nseems to have returned to me just now![VAR 0114(0079)]
There is only one thing to be done!\nLet the radiant flower bloom![VAR 0114(0079)]
Crownus bloomus![VAR 0114(0079)]
Take this, human child.[VAR 0114(0079)]
*pant pant*[VAR 0114(0079)]
It shames me to admit it, but a whole flower is\nbeyond me right now...[VAR 0114(0079)]
I do not know if that petal will be enough, but I\nstill must ask that you use it to try to create\r\nthe Reins of Unity.[VAR 0114(0079)]
The descendants of the family who once made\nthe reins for me should still live in the village.[VAR 0114(0079)]
I put my hopes on you, human child...[VAR 0114(0079)]
The Reins of Unity?\c\nI feel like the mayor’s family used to make a rope\ncalled something like that, but that was a\r\nwhile ago...
If you’re looking to do some research, why not\nread through the books at the mayor’s house?
You want to make a set of reins?\c\nWell, the mayor’s pretty good at making things.\nHe even made the village’s signature shirt!
Huh? The Reins of Unity?\nNever heard of ’em.
I’ve seen you running around, talking to everyone\nhere in this village. You seem pretty friendly!

Oh, hello again, savior of our village!\nCome to do some more reading?[VAR 0114(007A)]
Not this time!
I need a favor!
I beg your pardon? You want me to make a set\nof Reins of Unity?[VAR 0114(007A)]
Well, I say, that presents a bit of a problem.[VAR 0114(007A)]
If my dear great-granddad were still around,\nhe’d have been able to make you a set...[VAR 0114(007A)]
But unfortunately, we’ve no one left who knows\nthe traditional ways at this point.[VAR 0114(007A)]
What’s more, I doubt you have the flower you’d\nneed to forge a set of the reins.[VAR 0114(007A)]
I do have it!
Got a petal, at least!
[~ 10]
[~ 11]
Is...is that a petal from a radiant flower?[VAR 0114(007A)]
If so, would that not mean the King of Bountiful\nHarvests has truly...?\r\nNo, no! I dare not hope.[VAR 0114(007A)]
If I recall, my ancestors made Reins of Unity by\nfollowing the ways passed down in fairy tales...\c\nThere were two key materials—a flower and hairs\nfrom a Pokémon.[VAR 0114(007A)]
But I’m afraid those old traditions have long\nsince faded from memory.[VAR 0114(007A)]
Still, how could I refuse a favor to such a\nkind and helpful guest?\r\nThe materials, if you please![VAR 0114(007A)]
You handed the tuft of White Mane Hair and the\nRadiant Petal over to the mayor!
You handed the tuft of Black Mane Hair and the\nRadiant Petal over to the mayor!
I can’t promise this will turn out as well as the\nones my great-granddad would’ve made, but...[VAR 0114(007A)]
Time to breathe life back into the traditions\nof my village![VAR 0114(007A)]
*click clack*\n*click clack*
*whirr whirr*
Harrumph![VAR 0114(007A)]
I’m afraid it hasn’t come out well at all.[VAR 0114(007A)]
I fancy myself a crafty enough sort, but I suppose\nit’d take a craftsman of truly delicate technique\r\nto make such fine reins.[VAR 0114(007A)]
Oh, please don’t look so dejected.\nI’m very sorry. Truly I am.[VAR 0114(007A)]
Oi, Mr. Mayor![VAR 0114(0076)]
The hot water in my shower seems to have gone\non holiday![VAR 0114(0076)]
Ah, yes, terribly sorry. I’ll have a look at it soon.[VAR 0114(007A)]
Oh, you’re here, too, Chief?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Were you in the middle of somethin’?\nThe pair of you seem awful gloomy![VAR 0114(0076)]
Here’s what happened...
The mayor tried...
What? Is that all? Gahaaahaha!\nSo, all you need to do is make some nice cord![VAR 0114(0076)]
Pass me those materials for a mo.[VAR 0114(0076)]
All right! Got my petal, got my hair!\nNow what’m I supposed to do with ’em?[VAR 0114(0076)]
*ahem*\nIf I may be so bold, allow me to share a song\r\nthat survives from the legends...[VAR 0114(007A)]
Blossom woven round and rooound... ♪\nA royal gift in mane’s hair booound... ♪[VAR 0114(007A)]
Steady on, old bloke! The singin’s a bit much!\nOh well, that’ll do for an answer.[VAR 0114(0076)]
Hi-yayayaaah![VAR 0114(0076)]
All finished! Have a look!\nThink this’ll do?[VAR 0114(0076)]
You’re more capable than your face lets on!\nThese Reins of Unity are the spitting image of\r\nthose in my family’s tales![VAR 0114(007A)]
Gahaaahaha!\c\nI don’t sew all my dear rebellious daughter’s\nclothes for nothin’, you know![VAR 0114(0076)]
Even the explorer’s outfit I gave you was\nhandmade by yours truly, Chief![VAR 0114(0076)]
*ahem*\nIn any case![VAR 0114(007A)]
It seems you’ve got the Reins of Unity you need.[VAR 0114(007A)]
Isn’t that just smashing![VAR 0114(007A)]
How about it, Chief?\nHas my sewin’ saved the day?[VAR 0114(0076)]
If he was able to make a set of Reins of Unity...\nsurely that tuft of White Mane Hair and that\r\nRadiant Petal must have been genuine?\c\nNo, impossible. Perish the thought! Hoho.[VAR 0114(007A)]
If he was able to make a set of Reins of Unity...\nsurely that tuft of Black Mane Hair and that\r\nRadiant Petal must have been genuine?\c\nNo, impossible. Perish the thought! Hoho.[VAR 0114(007A)]

Would you believe it? I caught myself fallin’\nasleep outside again![VAR 0114(0076)]
I was chilled to the bone, so I thought I’d warm\nmyself up with a good, hot shower at our base.\r\nBut the water comin’ out was ice cold![VAR 0114(0076)]
I got ultra-mega-surprised and jumped out\nwithout putting on any of my—[VAR 0114(0076)]
Mlerrrgh...[VAR 0114(0076)]
Human child! Were you able to make the Reins\nof Unity?[VAR 0114(0079)]
You bet!
Chief Peony did!
Oh joy! What glorious news![VAR 0114(0079)]
Indeed? This man has done so much to aid me...\nI do hope I can repay him sometime.[VAR 0114(0079)]
I have some good news of my own.\nI was finally able to track down my loyal steed![VAR 0114(0079)]
Glastrier is making its home in the Crown Shrine!\c\nIt is a place where my loyal steed and I spent\nmuch time together![VAR 0114(0079)]
Spectrier is making its home in the Crown Shrine!\c\nIt is a place where my loyal steed and I spent\nmuch time together![VAR 0114(0079)]
I had been avoiding the place, as I feared I\nwould get trapped in mine own nostalgia...[VAR 0114(0079)]
Why has my loyal steed made the shrine its\nhome? Is it reminiscing about our time together?\r\nNo, it can’t be.[VAR 0114(0079)]
The Crown Shrine stands majestically atop the\nmountain to the north.[VAR 0114(0079)]
Bring the carrot and the Reins of Unity, and meet\nme there.[VAR 0114(0079)]
I shall hasten there now, but you may come when\nyou feel you are ready![VAR 0114(0079)]
I am counting on you, child...[VAR 0114(0079)]
I’m afraid we don’t have much to offer you, but\nyou’re welcome to stay for as long as you’d like.
There are a few strange ruins you can find in the\nCrown Tundra.\c\nBut the doors won’t budge, whether you push or\npull on them!
Head east from the Giant’s Bed and climb up the\nmountain to the north, and you’ll find an old\r\nshrine sitting there.
Be very careful if you’re going to climb the\nmountain, you hear?\c\nThe path to the summit is long and treacherous.
Isn’t my Spheal just the roundest thing ever?
I suppose it’s about time I repaired the shower in\nthe village inn...[VAR 0114(007A)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : rigel2_main_0170

I have been waiting, human child.[VAR 0114(0079)]
The Crown Shrine is a place I once called home.[VAR 0114(0079)]
Glastrier must think me helpless now that I have\nlost my powers. It taunts me by making this\r\nplace its own dwelling.[VAR 0114(0079)]
Spectrier must think me helpless now that I have\nlost my powers. It taunts me by making this\r\nplace its own dwelling.[VAR 0114(0079)]
Ah... I see you have indeed brought me the Reins\nof Unity. You have my thanks, child.[VAR 0114(0079)]
You gave the Reins of Unity to Calyrex!
Ahhh... The feeling of holding these again...\nThe color... The way they shine in the light...[VAR 0114(0079)]
Oh, how this brings back memories...[VAR 0114(0079)]
Glastrier is a very proud Pokémon.\nOne might even call it arrogant.[VAR 0114(0079)]
Spectrier is a very proud Pokémon.\nOne might even call it arrogant.[VAR 0114(0079)]
It will not accept me as its master again unless\nI am able to prove that my power outweighs\r\nits own.[VAR 0114(0079)]
I will use the Reins of Unity to pour my power\ninto the very body of my loyal steed.[VAR 0114(0079)]
That should convince it that I am indeed still\ndeserving of its loyalty![VAR 0114(0079)]
Now, human child, in order to lure my loyal steed\nto me...[VAR 0114(0079)]
place the Iceroot Carrot into the basket near\nwhere Glastrier’s made its bed.[VAR 0114(0079)]
place the Shaderoot Carrot into the basket near\nwhere Spectrier’s made its bed.[VAR 0114(0079)]

Do you want to place the Iceroot Carrot?
Do you want to place the Shaderoot Carrot?
The time has come, human child![VAR 0114(0079)]
But you have successfully defeated my loyal\nsteed once already...[VAR 0114(0079)]
It will not willingly approach anyone it considers\nto be a threat.[VAR 0114(0079)]
We must hide and wait for it to appear![VAR 0114(0079)]

Thanks to your efforts, I have been reunited with\nmy loyal steed.[VAR 0114(0079)]

I was convinced that the people no longer\nbelieved in me... And I had also lost my\r\nloyal steed...\r\nI was trapped in the throes of deep loneliness.[VAR 0114(0079)]
But you saved me.[VAR 0114(0079)]
There are truly no words with which to fully\nexpress my gratitude to you.[VAR 0114(0079)]
So...I have a suggestion.[VAR 0114(0079)]
If you are able to catch me even with my\npowers restored...[VAR 0114(0079)]
it will prove your worth beyond any doubt, and I\nwill lend you my strength on your journey.[VAR 0114(0079)]
Once you have readied yourself, come face me.[VAR 0114(0079)]
Ah, but first...[VAR 0114(0079)]
I should get this man back to where I found him.[VAR 0114(0079)]

Hello? That you, Chief?\nIt’s me—Peony![VAR 0114(0076)]
I just had a dream about a bigheaded\nPokémon, talkin’ on and on in a weird shrine...[VAR 0114(0076)]
I just remembered I had a dream a while back\nabout a strange bigheaded Pokémon.\c\nIt was jabberin’ away at this weird shrine![VAR 0114(0076)]
You were there, too, Chief!\nIt all felt so real![VAR 0114(0076)]
I got worried about you and decided I’d better\ngive you a call and check in![VAR 0114(0076)]
You haven’t hurt yourself, have you, Chief?\nNot in a bunch of trouble, are you?![VAR 0114(0076)]
I’m fine!
Everything’s under control!
Ah, good to hear! Guess I got nothin’ to worry\nabout, then! Gahahaaa![VAR 0114(0076)]
The Peony Exploration Team is all about the\nsafety and well-bein’ of its members, after all![VAR 0114(0076)]
So you be careful on your way back, too,\nyou hear?[VAR 0114(0076)]
No expedition’s over until you’re safe and\nsound back at home base![VAR 0114(0076)]
Gahaaahaha![VAR 0114(0076)]
Better report back to Chief Peony!
Our crops are doing exceptionally well recently!\nThe King of Bountiful Harvests certainly is living\r\nup to its name!
Have you seen that massive tree to the south\nof the village?
Is that big man who’s staying in the inn someone\nyou know?\c\nMy goodness but he has a voice to match his\nsize! I nearly fainted when he greeted me!
A young professor’s staying at our home.\nI even got her autograph!
That young professor’s gone home.\c\nMy Beldum is feeling awfully lonely since it\ndoesn’t have Yamper to play with anymore...
We’ll continue to live here on the Crown Tundra.\nEven if the king is no longer with us.
Hoho! How’re your legendary adventures going?[VAR 0114(007A)]

Huh? Well, how ’bout that, Chief![VAR 0114(0076)]
Looks like that was the last bit of the grand\nPeony Adven-tour that I had for you![VAR 0114(0076)]
Whoooooo! Now this is an occasion!\nWhat’s the word? Ultra-mega-epic![VAR 0114(0076)]
Your passion for all this caught me\noff guard, Chief...[VAR 0114(0076)]
This whole Adven-tour thing was built out of a\nload of rubbish I scraped together. Even I had\r\nmy doubts about the whole thing.\r\nBut you? You went at it with a ton of energy![VAR 0114(0076)]
You don’t s’pose those Pokémon you caught\nwere really the ones in the legends, do you?[VAR 0114(0076)]
I do!
Well, actually...
Nah, actually, never mind. You don’t have to tell\nme anything![VAR 0114(0076)]
A look at your face tells me everything I need to\nknow, Chief.[VAR 0114(0076)]
I can tell that you must’ve done some\nultra-mega-epic explorin’![VAR 0114(0076)]
And whatever you discovered on your way...\nthat’s a special treasure just for you![VAR 0114(0076)]
I’m not about to rain on your parade by bein’\nnosy and askin’ silly questions![VAR 0114(0076)]
Well, Chief [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nThanks for stickin’ around and finishin’ every part\nof my Adven-tour![VAR 0114(0076)]

Hehe! You’re really on my wavelength.[VAR 0114(0078)]
Heh, yeah, sorry for all that![VAR 0114(0078)]
So you actually kept my old man company!\nCheers, I owe you one![VAR 0114(0078)]

Also, that’s way too close!\nI need some personal space here![VAR 0114(0078)]
R-right! First things first!\nI’ve got something for you, Nia...[VAR 0114(0076)]

Why have I got to wear this golden one when\nyours is normal?[VAR 0114(0078)]
Gahahaha! Isn’t it obvious?\nYou’re my darlin’ daughter![VAR 0114(0076)]
I want you to shine so bright that everyone\nnotices you![VAR 0114(0076)]
Ugh! It’s things like this![VAR 0114(0078)]

No! Come back, Nia![VAR 0114(0076)]
No need to be so rebellious!\nI know you really love me! Don’t you?![VAR 0114(0076)]
Agh! Sorry for the sudden commotion, Chief!\nIt was a blast explorin’ with you![VAR 0114(0076)]
You’re free to keep usin’ our base camp,\nof course![VAR 0114(0076)]

Hmm? Hang on—isn’t that the Max Lair there in\nthat clue?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Waaagh!
Huh?[VAR 0114(0076)]
What happened?!
Creatures! A horde of creatures appeared\ninside the Max Lair!\c\nAnd we don’t know if they’re Pokémon!
What?!
Has something caused alien beings to appear?\c\nAnd is this somehow connected to that Ultra\nWormhole that opened up briefly in the sky?
Well, sounds like some new, crazy thing’s afoot![VAR 0114(0076)]
And you know what that means, Chief!\nBet you a new expedition’s approachin’![VAR 0114(0076)]
And I know just what to call this one![VAR 0114(0076)]
Ha! How d’you like that one, Chief?[VAR 0114(0076)]

Moves that only select Pokémon can learn...\nThey are called ultimate moves.\r\nDo you want your Pokémon to learn one of them?
All right. Fair enough. If you want your Pokémon\nto learn one of my moves, just come back.
Oh, but none of the Pokémon you’re with can\nlearn my move! That’s too bad!
Which Pokémon should learn my move?
[VAR 0102(0001)] can’t learn my move.
An Egg... I can’t teach my move to an Egg.
[VAR 0102(0001)] already knows my move.
Which move should be forgotten?
[VAR 0102(0000)] learned [VAR 0107(0001)]![VAR BE05(0004)][VAR BE05(0001)]
One...[WAIT 20]two...[WAIT 20]and...[WAIT 20][WAIT 20]ta-da![VAR BE05(0003)][VAR BE05(0000)]\c\n[VAR 0102(0000)] forgot [VAR 0107(0001)]!\c\nAnd it learned [VAR 0107(0002)] instead![VAR BE05(0004)][VAR BE05(0001)]
An ultimate move...\c\nHow you handle its overwhelming destructive\npower and its aftermath will be the key!
I’m devoting what’s left of my life to helping\nyoung Trainers grow.\c\nI’d like to teach the ultimate moves to\nas many successors as I can.\c\nIs it all right to teach them to your\nPokémon, too?
Would it be all right if I taught your Pokémon the\nultimate moves?
Young Trainer, the Pokémon with you can’t\nlearn these moves.\c\nPlease thoroughly check the list of Pokémon\nthat can learn these moves.
Young Trainer, feel free to come visit me\nany time you want.
Well, please tell me which Pokémon I\nshould teach.
Young Trainer, that Pokémon can’t learn an\nultimate move.\c\nPlease thoroughly check the list of Pokémon\nthat can learn these moves.
Young Trainer, I can’t teach a move to\nan Egg.
Young Trainer, that Pokémon’s bond with\nyou is not yet strong enough.\c\nIt can learn the move once it forms a strong\nbond with you.
Young Trainer, that Pokémon already knows\nthe ultimate move.
Is it all right to teach [VAR 0107(0001)]\nto [VAR 0101(0000)]?
Pokémon that can learn the ultimate\nmoves...\c\nThe blazing Fire-type Pokémon:\nCharizard, Typhlosion, Blaziken, Infernape,\nEmboar, Delphox, and Incineroar!\c\nThe restless Water-type Pokémon:\nBlastoise, Feraligatr, Swampert, Empoleon,\nSamurott, Greninja, and Primarina!\c\nThe quiet Grass-type Pokémon:\nVenusaur, Meganium, Sceptile, Torterra,\nSerperior, Chesnaught, and Decidueye!\n
Please choose a move that will be replaced\nwith [VAR 0107(0000)].
[VAR 0102(0000)] did not learn\n[VAR 0107(0001)].

Back at the dojo, you were merely an eyesore—\nan obstruction blocking the spotlight I so\r\nrightfully deserved.\c\nYet reaching this pinnacle alongside you fills me\nwith a certain unexpected pride.[VAR 0114(0072)]
With your raw skill combined with my prodigious\npsychic powers, the idea that anyone should ever\r\nbe able to defeat us is positively unimaginable![VAR 0114(0072)]
Ahaha! You know, I really didn’t like you at first,\nkid. But now that we’ve won this thing...\c\nI’m actually happy that I did it together\nwith you![VAR 0114(0071)]
Yes! Did it again!\nI can’t get enough of this feeling!\c\nAll you people watching, hope you like your\ndouble dose of our toxic teamwork![VAR 0114(0071)]
Woo-hoo! Did you see that, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nWe won—little old me and you together!\c\nI say if you have fun in life, you’ve already won!\nAnd nobody out there can beat us in that![VAR 0114(0073)]
Ahhh, the sweet smell of victory!\nNever gets old, does it?\c\nBet you all these big, flashy wins will have new\nstudents swarmin’ to the dojo, too![VAR 0114(0073)]
That’s an ultra-mega-victory for the Peony\nExploration Team on the books!\c\nNothing’s quite as satisfyin’ as firin’ off some\nmighty moves, is it, Chief?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Oops! Beat ’em all again, have we?\c\nGahaha! You and me, Chief—we’re just plain\nultra-mega-unstoppable together![VAR 0114(0076)]
Thanks, [VAR 0100(0000)]! That’s just the kind of\nfierce battle that gets everyone worked up!\c\nI’m proud to have won this thing together with\nyou, Champion![VAR 0114(0004)]
Typical [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nThat’s just what I expected of you by now!\c\nIt always gets me pumped up when I see how you\nseem to grow stronger with each battle.\c\nTogether we’re going to propel all the Trainers in\nthe Galar region to even greater heights![VAR 0114(0004)]
I suppose a win is a win, though it doesn’t sit very\nwell with me that I have to share this victory\r\nwith you of all people...[VAR 0114(000C)]
This was the only outcome you could have\nexpected with me as your partner, of course.\r\nSo congratulations on choosing wisely.[VAR 0114(000C)]
[VAR 0100(0000)], we did it!\nWe beat every single one of ’em![VAR 0114(000D)]
I knew we could do it! You an’ me are gonna\nwin all there is to win!\c\nEverybody in Galar is gonna know that we’re the\nstrongest duo around![VAR 0114(000D)]
That’s just like you, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nAll my Grass-type Pokémon are delighted\r\nwith this first-place win![VAR 0114(000E)]
Well done, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nThat’s our Champion!\c\nI always feel a bit stronger when I’ve got you at\nmy side in a battle.[VAR 0114(000E)]
The waves have receded, and only you and I\nare left standing...\c\nCongratulations on this victory, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nAnd thank you for it.[VAR 0114(000F)]
The raging wave crashes again!\c\nAs long as we’re partnered up, I can’t imagine\nany wave we couldn’t ride together.[VAR 0114(000F)]
A fine performance, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nWe’ve claimed victory here together!\c\nI could almost combust with joy, and I’m already\nlooking forward to our next match together![VAR 0114(0010)]
We burned brightly in this latest tournament\nas well!\c\nI thank you for choosing me to battle beside you\nonce again, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0010)]
Hey, winnin’ with you’s not bad.\nD’you think the crowd wants an encore?\c\nI wouldn’t mind makin’ an exception to\nmy rule, just this once.[VAR 0114(0016)]
So we won again?\nI mean, sure, that’s real nice and all. I’m happy.\c\nBut I’ve had my time as a Gym Leader already.\nWinnin’ too much now would be overkill, innit?[VAR 0114(0016)]
That was a great victory. Just right for keeping up\nmy image as the great Raihan!\c\nNow, time for one great selfie to capture it!\nSmile already, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0017)]
When you put the greatest Trainers together,\nthe only thing they can’t do is lose!\c\nAt this rate, we might just end up making history.\nCome on, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Strike a pose!\c\nWe’ve got to capture this moment for the future![VAR 0114(0017)]
We did it...\nWe have won the tournament!\c\nI can stand tall knowing that we were able to\ngive all that we had together in this fight.[VAR 0114(0011)]
We did it, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nOur breathing was more in sync than ever.\c\nIf you’d like, we should battle alongside one\nanother again sometime.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I enjoyed that tournament quite a bit.\c\nThe way that you battled, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nThat’s what makes you worthy to be my partner.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Nothing surprising about this outcome, when you\nconsider how strong the two of us are.\c\nIf you want, I don’t mind continuing to help you\nout with racking up these wins.[VAR 0114(0014)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]!\nW...we won!\r\nTh-this is... This is amazing![VAR 0114(0012)]
I...I’m so glad, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nI’d be happy to partner with you...anytime![VAR 0114(0012)]
What a strong performance all around!\nThis victory was a true team effort.\c\nNow, just remember—even if we’re on opposite\nsides next time, don’t you hold back one jot![VAR 0114(0015)]
Hee! Looks like we went and won again!\c\nSeems like you might grow rather attached to\nhaving me as a partner if this carries on, hmm?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Quite what I’ve come to expect of you, my liege:\nseizing victory even while carrying my weight!\c\nLoath as I am to enjoy this thrill without my dear\nyounger brother...I am delighted from my toes to\r\nthe tip of my hair![VAR 0114(0068)]
Well, well, well...\nI’m afraid it can no longer slip my notice!\c\nThe way that you continue to choose me as your\npartner in victory...\c\nYou’ve come to most ardently admire me,\nhaven’t you, young M[VAR 1100(00FF,0205)]asters. [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0068)]
How magnificent—seizing victory even while\ntowing my humble self along for the ride!\c\nYou, young M[VAR 1100(00FF,0205)]asters. [VAR 0100(0000)], deserve to\nbe crowned Global Celebrity of the Year![VAR 0114(0069)]
The way that you’ve chosen me to share in your\nvictories time and again...\c\nYoung M[VAR 1100(00FF,0205)]asters. [VAR 0100(0000)], are you perhaps\nthe champion of being too fond of me?\c\nForgive me, Older Brother, but only one of us\ncan monopolize [VAR 0100(0000)]’s favor—\r\nand it’s me![VAR 0114(0069)]
Being able to beat everyone else together with\nmy rival [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nI’m gonna ride this high to really crush my studies\nand become a great professor! Just you watch![VAR 0114(0005)]
Getting to win this thing together with you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]—it’s the best every time!\c\nAnd [VAR 0101(0001)] seems to be on cloud nine,\ntoo, getting to battle alongside you!\r\nHeh heh... Thanks for giving us both this chance![VAR 0114(0005)]
Congratulations, young [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]manlady.\c\nThough teaming up with you always makes me\nput on a grander show than I’d planned.\c\nStill...I have to admit I had fun. You’d think I’d\nhave outgrown this kind of thing by now!\r\nIt seems I’m quite beyond help in that regard.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Congratulations are in order...or are they indeed,\nyoung [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]manlady?\c\nAre you sure this is what you want—sharing the\nspotlight of victory with an old crone like me?\c\nOh, you are, are you?\c\nHmph...\nPerhaps you’re starting to get a bit pink\r\nyourself, after all...[VAR 0114(0013)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]! Hop![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]! Marnie![VAR 0114(0004)]
I offer you my heartfelt congratulations on your\nvictory in the Galarian Star Tournament![VAR 0114(0004)]
I set up this tournament so that Trainers could\nwork together and push each other to greater\r\nheights as they battle...[VAR 0114(0004)]
And it’s turned out to be an even greater success\nthan I ever thought it would be![VAR 0114(0004)]
You were amazing!
Thank you! Both of you!\nOur new Champion and our old one!
All the matches were brilliant!
You hear that? The voices of Galar...\nThe excitement we brought all those people...[VAR 0114(0004)]
They can’t help but be moved by that fantastic\nperformance you two just put on!\r\nTheir hearts are crying out for more![VAR 0114(0004)]
And this glorious tournament that’s brought so\nmuch fire to the people of Galar...\r\nWell, its time is up. We have our clear winners.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Though it’s an awful shame to have to end it,\nafter all the fun it’s been...[VAR 0114(0004)]
Which is why...[VAR 0114(0004)]
I’m pleased to announce that the Galarian Star\nTournament will continue from this day on![VAR 0114(0004)]
Whoaaa! Whaaaat?!
You mean there’ll be more matches?!\nThat’s the best news we’ve had all year!
You can have as many tournaments in this\nMulti Battle format as you can stomach![VAR 0114(0004)]
If you want, you can stick with the same partner\nnext time—or try something different![VAR 0114(0004)]
We’ll get all the strongest Trainers in the Galar\nregion into this wild mix...[VAR 0114(0004)]
And we’ll run wild next time! And the next!\nAnd every time after that![VAR 0114(0004)]
As long as Trainers and Pokémon keep aiming\nfor the top together![VAR 0114(0004)]
As long as our fans want to watch our battles,\ntheir hands sweaty with nerves and excitement![VAR 0114(0004)]
We’ll go on for a thousand years!\nWe’ll carry on forever![VAR 0114(0004)]
So, everyone! Until we next meet![VAR 0114(0004)]
Now let’s have the Maximizers play us off![VAR 0114(0004)]
Shauuu!
Woo-hoo! All right!

Knock it off!\nI can’t trim an Egg!
I only feel love for Furfrou.\nI won’t trim any other Pokémon!
Hmmm? Hmmm? That won’t change\nanything, though.
Poodle Pokémon with fluffy fur...\nMy fingers are itching to trim Furfrou so bad.

It’s my solemn duty to teach a move to\nMythical Pokémon.\c\nAlthough I’m on vacation, I could teach a\nmove to your Mythical Pokémon.\c\nWhat do you say?
Whoa! Your Pokémon already knows the move\nI can teach!
What a shame! I could teach a move if you were\nwith Keldeo or Meloetta.
I could teach a move to your Mythical Pokémon.\nWhat do you say?
Speak to me again if you change your mind.
Even I can’t teach my moves to an Egg!

Moves that only select Pokémon can learn...\nThey are called battle-combo moves.\r\nDo you want your Pokémon to learn one of them?
All right. Fair enough. If you want your Pokémon\nto learn one of my moves, just come back.
Oh, but none of the Pokémon you’re with right\nnow can learn my move. That’s too bad!
Which Pokémon should learn my move?
[VAR 0102(0001)] can’t learn my move.
An Egg... I can’t teach my move to an Egg.
[VAR 0102(0001)] already knows my move.
Which move should be forgotten?
[VAR 0102(0000)] learned [VAR 0107(0001)]![VAR BE05(0004)][VAR BE05(0001)]

Battle-combo moves...\c\nHow you combine them with each other is\nthe key to using them well!
Did you get a Pokémon from the island kahuna\nor professor, maybe?\c\nIt doesn’t matter if it’s evolved into something\nelse since then.\c\nAs long as it’s a Fire-, Water-, or Grass-type\nPokémon that new Trainers are given around\r\nhere, and it’s really friendly toward you, I’ll\r\nteach it a special move—a battle-combo move.
A special move...\c\nShall I teach your Pokémon a\nbattle-combo move?
There is no move that I can teach to any of the\nPokémon you are with...
I see...\nWell, see you next time.
Which Pokémon will it be, then?
That Pokémon can’t learn a move from me.
Do you want me to teach my move to an Egg?!\nYou are being unreasonable.
This Pokémon... It doesn’t look like it’s too\ncomfortable with you yet.
That Pokémon already knows one of my moves.
Do you want me to teach [VAR 0101(0000)]\n[VAR 0107(0001)]?
My favorite Pokémon are all the Pokémon you\nget from people like professors or kahunas.\c\nI teach special moves—battle-combo moves—to\nthose Pokémon and the Pokémon that evolve\r\nfrom them. That’s what I do!
Please choose a move that will be replaced\nwith [VAR 0107(0000)].

To be pitted against the two of us from the\noutset spells certain tragedy for our opponents![VAR 0114(0072)]
Shall I overwhelm them with my powerful psychic\npowers? Why yes, I think I shall![VAR 0114(0072)]
Now now... I caution you not to make Avery\npull a Teleport on you![VAR 0114(0072)]
Shall we offer our next opponents a taste of\ndeepest despair, then?[VAR 0114(0072)]
The true victory lies in winning with the\nutmost elegance.[VAR 0114(0072)]
Now is the time, Avery!\nWe shall not let victory slip through our fingers![VAR 0114(0072)]
So the first trick is just to rack up a win, right?[VAR 0114(0071)]
Seems like a great chance to show off just how\ntoxic we can be![VAR 0114(0071)]
Remember how I poured poison all over our last\nopponents? Yeah, I’m thinking I’ll do that again![VAR 0114(0071)]
Doesn’t matter who we’re up against! They’ll all\nget a toxic dose of Klara and [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0071)]
Stand aside, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nI got this one![VAR 0114(0071)]
We’re gonna win this match...\nAin’t nobody gonna stop us![VAR 0114(0071)]
The first step is the most important one!\nLet’s make it a huge step![VAR 0114(0073)]
So many Galarian stars in this tournament!\nThis should be fun![VAR 0114(0073)]
The next opponent looks strong, too!\nHow exciting![VAR 0114(0073)]
Don’t hold back, dear [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nLet’s put on a show for them![VAR 0114(0073)]
I can’t imagine losing when I’m teamed up with\nyou, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0073)]
All right, this is the final boss, as they say!\nLet’s do our best, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0073)]
Can you imagine if we lost in the first match?\nSounds downright embarrassin’, eh, Chief?[VAR 0114(0076)]
All right! Time to go all in for victory,\nChief [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0076)]
Hey, what match was this again?\nMight have lost track a bit...[VAR 0114(0076)]
My little Nia’s watching, too.\nPapa can’t afford to look bad now![VAR 0114(0076)]
Right then, Chief! Let’s wrap this up and seize\nthat sweet, sweet victory![VAR 0114(0076)]
Right! Let’s do this![VAR 0114(0076)]
Let’s turn this match up to eleven...\nReally put on a show for the crowd![VAR 0114(0004)]
Double Champions means we’re going to have\na doubly champion time! Starting now![VAR 0114(0004)]
Whichever side has the greater passion for\nvictory is the side that will win.[VAR 0114(0004)]
No need to be shy or nervous.\nLet’s just do what we always do![VAR 0114(0004)]
We’re the best team in this tournament...\nI say it’s time we prove it![VAR 0114(0004)]
Nobody can defeat us when we’re teamed up\ntogether, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’ll appreciate it if you do your best. That way,\nI can shine even brighter by comparison.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Pink is all well and good, I suppose, but I think\nI’ll cover you in the color of Bede![VAR 0114(000C)]
Please don’t let your guard down just because\nyou’re the Champion.[VAR 0114(000C)]
You can leave this to me, you know.\nJust stand by and watch a master do his work.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I hope the victory celebrations are being\nprepared properly for us.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I will not settle for second place, understand?\nIt would be a disgrace, especially when I’m\r\nwith you.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Let’s show ’em our teamwork![VAR 0114(000D)]
We’re gonna win this...together![VAR 0114(000D)]
All my mates from Spikemuth are cheerin’ us on![VAR 0114(000D)]
Toss your Poké Ball on my mark, OK?\nAre you ready?[VAR 0114(000D)]
This is it... The last big match.\nHey, d’you need me to cheer you on a bit?[VAR 0114(000D)]
I’m trustin’ you, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000D)]
In both battles and farming, it’s the first soil\nyou lay down that matters the most![VAR 0114(000E)]
Well then, shall we get this haystack\nrolling, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000E)]
Just battling with you seems to perk my\nGrass-type Pokémon right up![VAR 0114(000E)]
I think you and I can harvest a victory from the\nsecond battle, too.[VAR 0114(000E)]
The two of us working together can tear out\nany opponent by the roots![VAR 0114(000E)]
Let’s make our teamwork blossom into a\nbeautiful victory![VAR 0114(000E)]
Let’s direct the flow of this tournament our way\nby snagging one win for starters.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Don’t worry. I won’t let anyone sink our team![VAR 0114(000F)]
That’s it! We’ve got the tide on our side, so now\nall we need to do is go with the flow![VAR 0114(000F)]
I’m at my best when I team up with you!\nIt’s like I’m a mermaid who’s found water![VAR 0114(000F)]
We’ve made it this far, so let’s keep going to the\nfinish line. Don’t let your guard down![VAR 0114(000F)]
Even if I have to flood this stadium and turn it\ninto an ocean, I’ll swim my way through![VAR 0114(000F)]
Let’s go, Champion!\nTime to set the stadium on fire![VAR 0114(0010)]
This is the very first match, and I can already sense\nthat sparks are going to fly! Watch out for burns![VAR 0114(0010)]
Don’t let our victory go to your head.\nThe next opponent’s going to be strong![VAR 0114(0010)]
Hustle, hustle, hustle, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nYou can do it, you can do it, Kabu! ...Sorry.[VAR 0114(0010)]
This is the final battle!\nDon’t burn out until the very end![VAR 0114(0010)]
We can win this! We can reach the top!\nWe’ve got this, OK?[VAR 0114(0010)]
Well then, let’s get this show on the road.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Hope you’re ready to fling that Poké Ball.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Time for round two.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Don’t worry ’bout me. I’ll get nice and amped up\nonce the battle starts.[VAR 0114(0016)]

Let’s give this crowd somethin’ to cheer about![VAR 0114(0016)]
Let’s show them just how good we\nare, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0017)]
Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nLet’s keep the crowd’s eyes riveted on us![VAR 0114(0017)]
Whoa! Almost got ready to throw out two\nPoké Balls. Force of habit![VAR 0114(0017)]
I might change the weather, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nDon’t hate on me if I do![VAR 0114(0017)]
Galar will see soon enough which side is the\nbetter team![VAR 0114(0017)]
The great Raihan is an unstoppable force,\nracking up victories! Don’t get left behind![VAR 0114(0017)]
The battle is about to start.\nReady yourself.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Let’s do our best together, hand in hand.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Let’s keep our teamwork honed sharp for the\nsecond round.[VAR 0114(0011)]
The opponents won’t be pushovers.\nLet’s give them the battle they deserve![VAR 0114(0011)]
This is the final battle. Let’s make sure to have\nno regrets, whether we win or lose.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Our fists combined should be more than enough\nto punch through any wall standing in our way![VAR 0114(0011)]
Don’t worry—if things get too dicey, I’ll back\nyou up.[VAR 0114(0014)]
We’re going to absolutely rock this crowd![VAR 0114(0014)]
Whew! Doing a backflip takes quite a bit of\nfocus, you know.[VAR 0114(0014)]
We’re going to win this one, too.\nYou got that, Champion?[VAR 0114(0014)]
Just battle like you always do.\nVictory will come naturally![VAR 0114(0014)]
Let’s grab first place for all our fans![VAR 0114(0014)]
I-I’m ready...[VAR 0114(0012)]
S-so many people...\nI’m a bit scared, but I’ll do my best![VAR 0114(0012)]
C-come on, my Ghost-type Pokémon...\nLend your strength to [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0012)]

Y-you can do it, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nI...I believe in you![VAR 0114(0012)]
Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nLet’s win this, nice and cool![VAR 0114(0015)]
Come on now! Back straight! Chin up!\nYes, that’s the posture of a Champion![VAR 0114(0015)]
They may be all fired up for battle, but we’ll\nfreeze them solid—passion and all.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Now, which Pokémon do you think I should knock\nout first?[VAR 0114(0015)]
You and I, we can do this!\nOne of them’s all yours, love![VAR 0114(0015)]
One more battle, and we’ve got this in the bag!\nWe can do this together![VAR 0114(0015)]
Let us show these plebeians our noble skills![VAR 0114(0068)]
[VAR 0100(0000)], my liege!\nI swear on my honor—I will not fail you![VAR 0114(0068)]
If it truly comes to it, you may use my splendid\nhair as a sword![VAR 0114(0068)]
This next opponent will not cause us any trouble,\nI’m sure. We might even have time for tea![VAR 0114(0068)]
If we win, I’ll be sure to give my dear brother a\nfull account of our marvelous deeds![VAR 0114(0068)]
If we win this, it will be undeniable that we are\nthe best team out there![VAR 0114(0068)]
Let us show the crowd the power of\ntrue celebrities![VAR 0114(0069)]
[VAR 0100(0000)], my liege!\nAllow me to prove my worth![VAR 0114(0069)]
I hope that my hair shield will be enough to\nprotect you...[VAR 0114(0069)]
This next opponent should be a piece of cake!\nI wish we could have a cup of tea to go with it.[VAR 0114(0069)]
Oh, my dear brother will be so jealous if we\nwin this one![VAR 0114(0069)]
With our celebrity powers combined, final\ntriumph should be but a trifle![VAR 0114(0069)]
First things first!\nLet’s pick up some momentum![VAR 0114(0005)]
Don’t let the new Hop surprise you, mate!\nYou can count on me![VAR 0114(0005)]
We can’t lose now! Time to bring out the full\nstrength of our Pokémon![VAR 0114(0005)]
It’s time for the Postwick dream team to show\npeople what we can do![VAR 0114(0005)]
Scoring a win together would really make my day,\nmate! Let’s do our best![VAR 0114(0005)]
We can win this, mate!\nWe can’t lose now![VAR 0114(0005)]
Let’s turn this stadium pink, shall we?[VAR 0114(0013)]
I’d love to toss in a quiz or two, but...\nI guess this isn’t the time.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Try to keep up, dear pink-lacking Champion.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I’ll show everyone that they don’t call me “the\nwizard” for nothing. And everyone includes you![VAR 0114(0013)]
Oh, so they’re our next opponents?\nThis should be fun.[VAR 0114(0013)]
If we win this, I might just have to make\na comeback...[VAR 0114(0013)]

I have redoubled my training efforts since my last\ndefeat at your hands, you see...[VAR 0114(0072)]
And I did it! I really did!\nI finally became a Gym Leader![VAR 0114(0071)]
And my efforts were rewarded gloriously!\nYou are looking at the chosen leader of the\r\nPsychic Gym![VAR 0114(0072)]
That’s amazing!
Congratulations!
Feel free to keep heaping on the praise and\nadoration! It really is a fantastic achievement!\r\nEven if our Gym is still in the minor division.[VAR 0114(0071)]
Well, our Gym is still in the minor division.\nBut you can feel free to praise me some more.\r\nIt’s perfectly deserved, of course.[VAR 0114(0072)]
Th...that really is amazing! I hope you’ll keep\nworking toward reaching the major division![VAR 0114(0005)]
Th...that really is amazing! I hope you’ll keep\nworking toward reaching the major division![VAR 0114(0005)]
H-Hoppy-kins...[VAR 0114(0071)]
Hop...[VAR 0114(0072)]
Well, you can bet your bottom I’ll be going all\nout in this event! Just you wait and see![VAR 0114(0071)]
Rest assured that I will bring my best\nperformance to this competition.\r\nI will be a fearsome challenger to face down![VAR 0114(0072)]
Suddenly I’m feeling all fired up for this thing!\c\nIf everyone’s taking it that seriously, I don’t want\nto be the one to lose![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hee hee! Don’t worry—I’ll knock you out nice\nand cold![VAR 0114(0071)]
Just what I like to hear![VAR 0114(0072)]
All right, everyone!\nSorry to have kept you waiting![VAR 0114(0004)]
First things first—I want to say a quick thank-you\nto all of you for coming running when I called![VAR 0114(0004)]
I really wanted to explain this in person, because\nI wanted to be sure I could get across to you\r\nall how great this idea is![VAR 0114(0004)]
Phew, would you take a look at this guy?\nGetting all serious on us in your old age, are\r\nyou? What is this grand idea anyway, Leon?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Hah! Don’t you start in on me, Raihan!\nI’m really trying here![VAR 0114(0004)]
See, I’ve spent my whole life battling with myself\nto try to become the greatest Trainer...[VAR 0114(0004)]
And then I saw how [VAR 0100(0000)] grew so\nstrong by competing against my little brother,\r\nHop...and how much it made Hop grow, too.[VAR 0114(0004)]
It really proved to me how much further you can\ngo when you’re battling against a proper rival![VAR 0114(0004)]
Hrmph...[VAR 0114(000C)]
And now that I’ve taken over running the League\nfrom Chairman Rose...[VAR 0114(0004)]
I’m thinking I want to bring even more thrilling\nbattles to our wonderful Galar region![VAR 0114(0004)]
So for both these reasons, I’ve called you all\nhere today to tell you that...[VAR 0114(0004)]
I’m declaring the Galarian Star Tournament open![VAR 0114(0004)]
The Galarian Star what?![VAR 0114(000D)]
*sigh*\c\nDoesn’t he ever tire of draggin’ other people\ninto his nonsense?[VAR 0114(0016)]
The Galarian Star Tournament will be an\nelimination tournament in Multi Battle format![VAR 0114(0004)]
I want all of you here to pair up with the\nstrongest partner you can think of...[VAR 0114(0004)]
then pool your power and work together to try to\nwin your way through the tourney![VAR 0114(0004)]
YEAHHHH!
You should find someone to partner with for\nthe tournament...

That’s Lee for you!\c\nHe knows how to start off a tournament nice\nand proper![VAR 0114(0005)]
Still, I wasn’t expecting to have to team up with\nsomeone... Oh, I know![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]! If you haven’t settled on a\npartner yet, why not team up with me?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Aw, that’s too bad... Well, let me know if you\nchange your mind, mate![VAR 0114(0005)]
Nobody’s going to be able to stop this team!\nWe’re sure to win this tournament. You’ll see![VAR 0114(0005)]
C’mon, mate! Let’s head to reception so we\ncan get all registered![VAR 0114(0005)]
Huh? Oh, you’ve already settled on a partner?[VAR 0114(0005)]
The Galarian Star Tournament, huh?\nSounds like my shot to see how good I’ve got.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Huh? Are you still lookin’ for a partner, too?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Hey, if you haven’t settled on anyone,\nwhy don’t we team up, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Oh, OK... That’s too bad. I bet we’d make a\nsmashin’ team![VAR 0114(000D)]
Rockin’! It’s decided, then!\c\nI’ve only got eyes for first place, you hear?\nNothin’ else is gonna cut it![VAR 0114(000D)]
Let’s head over to reception and get signed up.[VAR 0114(000D)]
You’ve already picked out a partner, huh?[VAR 0114(000D)]
I’ve decided to team up with Nessa. If you run\ninto us during the tournament, no need to\r\nhold anything back![VAR 0114(000E)]
I’m sure it would be fun to battle alongside\nyou, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nBut...I’m sorry. I’ve already settled on a partner.[VAR 0114(000F)]

I’ve already chosen my partner.\c\nForgive me, but allow me to remain your\nopponent this time—and let the sparks fly![VAR 0114(0010)]
Finding the perfect partner to compensate for\nyour own weaknesses...\c\nIn that sense, this battle has already begun.\nI don’t plan to lose.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Wh-wh-wh-what?!\nM-m-me?! Partner with...you?!\c\nD-doesn’t that seem a bit sudden?!\nI...I don’t think... No, I c-couldn’t possibly...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Partner with you? Why would I do that?\c\nI can’t crush you in battle if we’re on the same\nside, now, can I?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Having you battling beside me would be as\nheartening as anything could be...\c\nBut I’d rather face you as a rival, Champion.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Having you battling beside me would be very\nheartening, of course...\c\nBut I’d rather face you as a rival, Champion.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Every time I end up workin’ together with you, I\nget dragged into some kind’a awful mess.\c\nI think I’m good on disasters for the moment.\nI’ll pass on bein’ your partner this time.[VAR 0114(0016)]
[~ 37]
We ask that everyone remain until all the teams\nhave been decided and registered properly!
What’s that?! You’d like to have an absolute\nball battling alongside your pal, Ball Guy?
Boy, that’s an offer I’d love to roll with...\nBut this is one ball that doesn’t belong in battle!

Looks like our first opponents are Milo and\nNessa! Don’t let your guard down, mate...\r\nThey’re not gonna be pushovers![VAR 0114(0005)]

Come on, Milo. Don’t tell me you’re throwing in\nthe towel already![VAR 0114(000F)]
Together, I bet we can sweep aside any\nopponent—even if it’s the Champion![VAR 0114(000F)]
You can say that again!\c\nIn that case, guess I’d better really put my back\ninto it and show off a little![VAR 0114(000E)]
Don’t get too confident, mate!\c\nMe and my Pokémon’ve become a lot stronger\nsince the Gym Challenge![VAR 0114(0005)]
You’re not the only one showin’ off! I’ll show\nyou all the true strength of Spikemuth Gym![VAR 0114(000D)]

Battling together with you like this reminds me\nof our adventure in Rose Tower!\c\nI’m gonna go all out to show I can keep up with\nyou, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Not bad, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nI can already tell we’re gonna make a smashin’\ncombo after just one battle as teammates![VAR 0114(000D)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What an ideal matchup for letting both of us\nshow our strength.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Agreed.\nWe couldn’t have asked for better opponents.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I will press onward toward victory with every\nounce of strength in my body and soul![VAR 0114(0011)]
Between us, we make a monolith that won’t\neasily be crushed![VAR 0114(0014)]
Well, just look who we’re up against!\nNow, Champion, no hard feelings when we win![VAR 0114(0015)]
I...I’m not so g-great with Multi Battles...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Allister! No whining!\nNow’s the time to stand tall—understood?[VAR 0114(0015)]
I’ll...I’ll try my best.[VAR 0114(0012)]
These two aren’t the types of opponents we can\nafford to take lightly...\c\nBut we’re no strangers to bringing our A game!\nWe can do this, mate![VAR 0114(0005)]
Pretty odd team they make, isn’t it?\c\nStill, they could turn out to be a good combo in\ntheir own right...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Fighting types make a pretty rough matchup\nfor me...\c\nCan I just leave ’em to you, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000D)]

So here we are at the final battle.\nTook long enough, but we made it, eh?\c\nMy bro and Raihan ain’t gonna just hand us a\nwin, though—that’s for sure...\c\nBut listen. I’ve got your back no matter what,\nlong as you believe in me, too. All right?[VAR 0114(000D)]

[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! Hop!\nI knew you two’d make it through![VAR 0114(0004)]
From the moment I saw the tourney bracket,\nI knew this was how things would end up, Lee![VAR 0114(0005)]
Haha! Well then, here we are...facing off in the\nfinal round![VAR 0114(0004)]
This match’ll settle who’s the strongest team...\nSo let’s give it all the effort it deserves![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’ve gotta say, I’d still rather win this thing by\nbeating you, Leon...[VAR 0114(0017)]
But if it means schooling these two, then maybe\nteaming up with you isn’t too bad, either![VAR 0114(0017)]
Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nWe’re gonna win, even if we have to pry victory\nright from the hands of Lee’s team![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)] and Marnie, eh?\nYou’re gonna be one pain of a pair to battle.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I’ve been waitin’ for a chance to show you how\nstrong Spikemuth’s new Gym Leader is, Bro!\r\nFinally, I get to let you see firsthand![VAR 0114(000D)]
Oh, I’m well aware how strong you’ve got.\nBut I’m still your big brother. You get how it is.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Now bring it, Sis!\nGet ready to get crushed down to dust![VAR 0114(0016)]
I was really hoping for a chance to finally\nbeat Leon...[VAR 0114(0017)]
But I don’t mind missing that chance if it means I\nget to beat these two![VAR 0114(0017)]

Let me guess! You want me to teach Dragon\nAscent to your Pokémon. Am I correct?
You don’t seem to have Rayquaza—the only\nPokémon that can learn Dragon Ascent.
Come back any time you need my help.
Which Pokémon do you want me to teach\nthe move to?
That Pokémon can’t learn Dragon Ascent.\nOnly Rayquaza can learn the move.
I’ve never heard of an Egg that can use\nDragon Ascent!
That Rayquaza has already learned\nDragon Ascent.
Do you want me to teach Dragon Ascent\nto that [VAR 0101(0000)] of yours?
Dragon Ascent is a powerful move that only\nRayquaza can use.\c\nThey say its power is so strong that even a\nhuge meteoroid can be broken into pieces with\r\none attack.
Please choose a move that will be replaced\nwith [VAR 0107(0000)].
[VAR 0102(0000)] learned\n[VAR 0107(0001)]![VAR BE05(0004)][VAR BE05(0001)]

Hee hee! Of course! I totally have one![VAR 0114(0042)]
Naturally. I have made all the proper\npreparations, which you can observe with\r\nunclouded eyes.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Please allow me to check your pass.
Slooo...
Oh, a Slowpoke![VAR 0114(0042)]
Hmph. To meet a Slowpoke... Such a thing is\nsimply elegant.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Uh-oh, looks like another one’s gotten on the\ntrain and ridden over from the Isle of Armor.
Is this the first time you’ve seen a\nGalarian Slowpoke?\c\nThe coloring of the top of its head is curry-like.\nIsn’t it superduper cute?[VAR 0114(0042)]
Could this be your first time ever seeing a\nGalarian Slowpoke?\c\nWhere they’re from might be different, but\nthey’re still just as carefree as other Slowpoke.[VAR 0114(0042)]
There’s a lot of Slowpoke living on the\nIsle of Armor.\c\nNot sure if they feel like traveling or what,\nbut sometimes a few board the train.

Slooo?
You’re a Pokémon Trainer, right?
If Slowpoke blocks the ticket gate, it’ll cause\ntrouble for other customers.
Slowpoke are actually pretty heavy...\nSo, do you think you could catch it for me?
Slooow.
Battle Slowpoke in order to catch it?
Slowww?!
[~ 7]
Huh? Slowpoke still hasn’t stopped blocking the\nticket gate?
Looks like defeating Slowpoke isn’t enough.\nThe only way is to catch it!
Huh? You know that if you run away, then you\nwon’t be able to catch it, right?
To catch a Pokémon, you first need to weaken it.\nThen throw a Poké Ball!
Slo?!
Thanks much! Slowpoke can be a big trouble to\nmove sometimes.
Wow! Amazing![VAR 0114(0042)]
Hmmm? How interesting...[VAR 0114(0042)]
The way you caught that Slowpoke was\nthe absolute coolest.[VAR 0114(0042)]
I must say, your catching style was quite\nsimply elegant.[VAR 0114(0042)]
We apologize for the wait. We have checked\nyour Armor Pass.
All aboard the train to the Isle of Armor.\nMind your step when boarding.\c\nPlease be aware that there will be a connection\nalong the way.
Okaaay.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Understood.[VAR 0114(0042)]
I’m heading to a place called the\nIsle of Armor.\c\nI’m gonna catch some rare Pokémon and do\nsome training.[VAR 0114(0042)]
I am headed to an island called the Isle of Armor.\c\nI’ve heard it’s a place where one can catch rare\nPokémon and do lots of training.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Let’s hang if we meet up again, ’K?\nBye-bye, then! See ya![VAR 0114(0042)]

Oi oi, Chief!\nGot something legendary to show me?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Have a look!
Let’s battle!
Never mind
Aha, changed your mind?\nFair enough![VAR 0114(0076)]
What’ve you got for me?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Hold the phone, Chief. You haven’t got any\nLegendary Pokémon with you!\r\nGahaha! It happens![VAR 0114(0076)]
[VAR 0101(0001)]
[VAR 0101(0002)]
[VAR 0101(0003)]
[VAR 0101(0004)]

[VAR 0101(0006)]
Never mind
Oh? Don’t feel like showing me anything\nlegendary after all?\r\nGahaha! It happens![VAR 0114(0076)]
Aha! That’s Mewtwo, the ferocious Pokémon\ncreated through genetic manipulation, isn’t it?\c\nIts face is a bit on the pale side...\nSeems docile for the most part, though!\c\nIt might not have the friendliest-lookin’ mug,\nbut I’ll bet you it’s a decent sort on the inside![VAR 0114(0076)]
Oho, here it is!\nOur imposter Articuno!\c\nI always wonder what it’s thinkin’ in there behind\nthat dodgy mask...\c\nD’you get the feelin’ it’s lookin’ down its beak at\nus? Maybe it’s my imagination.[VAR 0114(0076)]
Whoa! It’s our imposter Articuno, only without\nthat dodgy mask!\c\nBet you it gets a lot more fans with those\nsharp, bright eyes out in the open, eh?\c\nHang on, though—has it gotten chilly in here?\nDid a blizzard blow in or somethin’?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Oho, here it is!\nOur imposter Zapdos!\c\nSeems like it’s done its best to be jagged and\nspiky and make its beak nice and sharp.\c\nIt really wants to be a proper Zapdos!\nFull marks for effort![VAR 0114(0076)]
Whoa! Looks like you’d get a massive jolt if you\nlaid a finger on this one!\c\nOur imposter Zapdos must’ve gotten some static\nelectricity in the old feathers!\c\nStatic builds up somethin’ fierce when the air\ngets cold and dry, doesn’t it?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Oho, here it is!\nOur imposter Moltres!\c\nIt may look a bit like it’s ablaze,\nbut it’s barely lukewarm!\c\nThat ultra-mega-feisty look in its eyes actually\nmakes me feel like we’d get on all right.[VAR 0114(0076)]
Whoa!\nNow those are some serious flames!\c\nHey, imposter Moltres!\nHave you got a fever or somethin’?\c\nYou get some rest, hear me?\nTake care of yourself![VAR 0114(0076)]
So this is the Legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh, eh?\nThe one with rainbow-colored wings?\c\nThere’s red for sure. Some white, some yellow...\nA few hues short of a rainbow, though, isn’t it?\c\nOh well. I’d hate to crush all your dreams,\nso I’ll take your word on it, Chief![VAR 0114(0076)]
So this is the Legendary Pokémon Lugia, eh?\nThe one they call the guardian of the seas?\c\nAnd yet it’s a Flying type!\nFancy that—being able to swim and fly!\r\nWhat CAN’T it do?\c\nI’ve heard they’ve got these sportin’ events\ncalled Pokéathlons in this one far-off region...\r\nBet you Lugia would be brilliant in those![VAR 0114(0076)]
So this is Raikou, the Pokémon they say\ndescended with a bolt of lightnin’?\c\nThat must’ve been a pretty rough ride,\neh, mate?\c\nNo wonder the mane on your back’s gone\nall curly.[VAR 0114(0076)]
So this is Entei, the Pokémon they say was born\nfrom a volcanic eruption?\c\nBorn from a volcano? Yeah, sure!\nPull the other one; it’s got bells on!\c\nSo you’re sayin’ its old man’s a volcano?\nOr what—is its mum a volcano?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Wow! That’s a beautiful Pokémon, that is!\nIs that Suicune?\c\nIt’s dead cool how that horn thing on its head\nsort of makes a loop!\c\nI wonder, though... How’s it supposed to roll over\nwhen it wants to sleep on the other side?\c\nI bet it’s got a rough time sleepin’ in general.\nYou all right, Suicune? Gettin’ your eight hours?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Whoa! Is that Groudon? The Pokémon they call\nthe personification of land?!\c\nIf the stories about how it sleeps in magma are\ntrue...that’s brilliant!\c\nI’m a regular at the sauna, so I get where it’s\ncoming from!\c\nBet it gets a nice spring in its step after a kip\nin that magma![VAR 0114(0076)]
Whoa! Is that Kyogre? The Pokémon they say\ncreated the seas?!\c\nIf the ocean’s the mother of all life...and Kyogre’s\nthe mother of the ocean...\r\nShould we all be callin’ Kyogre our nan?!\c\nListen up, Chief... You better be nice and gentle\nwith that Kyogre![VAR 0114(0076)]
Huh? Rayquaza? Isn’t it supposed to live way up\nhigh in the ozone layer?\c\nSounds like some serious high-altitude trainin’!\nIt must be one dedicated athlete!\c\nWell, it’s sure got a tough enough look on\nits face!\c\nI dunno what your sport is, Rayquaza,\nbut keep it up![VAR 0114(0076)]
So this is Latias, a Pokémon that can read\npeople’s minds usin’ telepathy...\c\nIt’s got a right cute little face for such a powerful\nPokémon, hasn’t it?\c\nAll right, mate, let’s see what you can do!\nWhat am I thinkin’ right now?\c\nWait, nope—cancel that!\nThat’s a terrifyin’ idea, now that I think about it![VAR 0114(0076)]
So Latios is supposed to be so dead smart, it\ncan understand human speech?\c\nThat’s brilliant if it’s true, but I dunno if I believe\nit... It’s a lot to swallow!\c\nHey, Latios, mate. You’re sorta like a big brother\nto Latias, right?\c\nWell, listen. You be a proper big brother and\nbe good to Latias. Got it?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Aha, here’s our little rock giant! Gahaha!\nSorry to tease, mate. Just having a laugh.\c\nDon’t you worry, rock giant—my respect for\nyou’s as thick as those broad shoulders!\c\nKeep up the good work, my fine rugged friend![VAR 0114(0076)]
Aha, here’s our little ice giant! Gahaha!\nSorry to tease, mate. Just having a laugh.\c\nDon’t you worry, ice giant—I can see the might\nof your massiveness as clear as my reflection\r\non you!\c\nKeep up the good work, my fine frozen friend![VAR 0114(0076)]

So this is Dialga?\nThe Pokémon that controls time?\c\nWell, if that’s not just talk...think it could give\nme a cheeky rewind whenever I make my\r\ndarlin’ Nia mad?\c\nThat aside...has this thing got a bangin’ cry\nor what?![VAR 0114(0076)]
So this is Palkia?\nThe Pokémon that controls space?\c\nWell, if that’s not just talk...I’d sure love it if I\ncould catch up to my dear Peonia instantly\r\nwhen she runs off! Just sayin’!\c\nThat aside...has this thing got a bangin’ cry\nor what?![VAR 0114(0076)]
So this is Giratina? A Pokémon that lives in a\nworld on the reverse side of ours?\c\nIt must’ve taken ages to get here from clear\naround the planet!\r\nGo on—plop down and have a rest, mate!\c\nThen again, looks like it’d be a speedy flier.\nMaybe a trip like that’s a doddle for Giratina![VAR 0114(0076)]
Uxie, eh? The Pokémon that governs\nknowledge and intelligence?\c\nBrilliant! I might have a few tiny gaps in the\nbrains department...\r\nMaybe it could front me some smarts!\c\nPlease and thank you kindly, O wise and\ngenerous Uxie!\c\nHey, what do you know?\nI feel brainier already!

Mesprit, eh?\nThe Pokémon that brought people emotions?\c\nI’ll admit I can get a tad caught up in my own\npassions now and then...\c\nMaybe Mesprit brought me a little too much?!\nNah, just having a bit of fun!\c\nI may get happier or sadder than other folks...\nbut that just means I’m makin’ the most of life![VAR 0114(0076)]
Azelf, eh? The Pokémon that gives people the\nwillpower to get through sticky situations?\c\nMaybe if I had one of these around, I’d be\nbetter at draggin’ myself out of bed or cleanin’\r\nup around the house!\c\nSounds like every home needs an Azelf!\nI’ve got to catch myself one![VAR 0114(0076)]
Heatran, the Lava Dome Pokémon?\nHmm...\c\nThat stout, plump frame... That cheeky look on\nits face...\r\nWhat an ultra-mega-lovable Pokémon!\c\nWhere’d you find this treasure?\nForget legends—I’d like to have one just to\r\ncarry around![VAR 0114(0076)]
Whoa! Is that the boss of the legendary giants?!\c\nIt’s gigantic enough—that’s for sure!\nOne gianty giant!\c\nWith all these dots, though, I’ve got no idea\nwhich ones are actually eyes.\c\nWhere’s a bloke supposed to look when he’s\ntalkin’ to this one?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Aha, it’s Cresselia! The Pokémon that represents\nthe crescent moon! Pretty, isn’t it?\c\nThose archy bits on its back look pretty\nstiff though, don’t they?\c\nHow’s the poor thing supposed to sleep on its\nside? Can it even turn over in bed?\r\nI worry about you, Cresselia...[VAR 0114(0076)]

Wait, wait, wait! You’re tellin’ me that’s a\nLegendary Pokémon?!\c\nThat mug’s a dead ringer for my grumpy\nold neighbor!\c\nSo that’s Tornadus, the Cyclone Pokémon, eh?\nWell, I guess my neighbor doesn’t stir up winds\r\nthat can blow houses away...[VAR 0114(0076)]
Wait, wait, wait! You’re tellin’ me that’s a\nLegendary Pokémon?!\c\nThat mug’s a dead ringer for my grumpy\nold neighbor!\c\nSo that’s Thundurus, the Bolt Strike Pokémon?\nWell, I guess my neighbor doesn’t zoom through\r\nthe sky, droppin’ lightning everywhere...[VAR 0114(0076)]
Wait, wait, wait!

That’s the Life Pokémon, Xerneas?\nThe one that can share eternal life?!\c\nThat’s brilliant and all, but what’s REALLY\nbrilliant is that set of antlers!\c\nThose things are ultra-mega-splendid...but they\nseem like they’d keep Xerneas from turnin’ over\r\nin bed.\c\nIs livin’ forever even worth it if you can’t get a\ngood kip in at night?[VAR 0114(0076)]
That’s the Destruction Pokémon, Yveltal?\nThe one that absorbs the life-force of\r\nlivin’ things?!\c\nLooks a bit like the letter Y, doesn’t it?\nWell, I’d sure like to know “why” Yveltal goes\r\naround absorbin’ life-force like that!\c\nYou can’t go stealin’ a bloke’s life-force without\nso much as a how-d’you-do![VAR 0114(0076)]
So this is Zygarde, a Pokémon made up of\nlots of little cells gathered together...\c\nJust goes to show how little bits here and there\nadd up!

So this one’s Necrozma, the Prism Pokémon?\nLooks pretty dark and...un-prism-y, eh?\c\nWhat?!

The picture of prismatic health![VAR 0114(0076)]
Nihilego, eh? The Parasite Pokémon?\nWhoa!

It’s Xurkitree, the Glowing Pokémon!\nWhat’s it playin’ at, being so pointy?!\c\nLooks a bit like it’s got plugs on its limbs...\nDoes it light up if you plug it into a socket?\r\nI bet it’d look smashin’!\c\nActually...cancel that.

What? Kartana, the Drawn Sword Pokémon?\c\nSure, Chief—pull the other one!\nI know a piece of origami when I see one.\c\nWhoever made this has got an eye for detail,\nthough.

Gwaaah!

Did those needles on its noggin just\nspray out poison?!\r\nWhatever world it came from must be wild![VAR 0114(0076)]
So this Naganadel’s a Poison Pin Pokémon that\ncame from another world?\c\nThat massive pointy needle sure looks\nultra-mega-strong, all right!\c\nBut, er...how’s it meant to kip with those three\nneedles pokin’ out of its backside?\c\nYou all right, Naganadel, mate?\nYou gettin’ enough sleep there?[VAR 0114(0076)]
The Rampart Pokémon, Stakataka!\nThat’s one mysterious life-form, all right!\c\nLook how many little blocks make up this one\nPokémon. They’re just the right size for a pillow\r\ntoo, eh?

The Fireworks Pokémon, Blacephalon!\nThat’s one mysterious life-form, all right!\c\nIt’s a funny one to look at with all that\nwigglin’, isn’t it?\c\nBit less funny to get so desperate you blow up\nyour own noggin, though!\c\nGettin’ the drop on someone’s great and all,\nbut don’t lose your head over it, eh?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Who’s this rockin’ the mohawk, Chief?\nFriend of yours?\c\nWhat? It’s Tapu Koko, a Land Spirit Pokémon\nthat’s the guardian deity of some island?!\c\nHm!

Who’s this rockin’ the eyelashes, Chief?\nFriend of yours?\c\nOh, it’s Tapu Fini, a Land Spirit Pokémon\nthat’s the guardian deity of some island?!\c\nHm!

Oi oi! As grand a noggin as ever, eh?\c\nThat’s our King of Bountiful Harvests, isn’t it?\nThe one callin’ the shots around here!\r\nIt’s a dead ringer for the statue in Freezington!\c\nHm...

Oho!

Did you hear a little voice say “thank you”\njust now? Or am I hearin’ things?[VAR 0114(0076)]
All right! Let’s go a round, then!\nGet ultra-mega-ready, Chief![VAR 0114(0076)]
Gahaha! That’s why you’re the chief, Chief!\nMighty strong Pokémon you’ve got!\c\nCopperajah and the rest look ultra-mega-\npleased that they got a chance to cut\r\nloose, too![VAR 0114(0076)]
Ha! Chalk another one up for me!\c\nNothin’ feels as ultra-mega-great as leadin’ your\nown Pokémon in battle, does it?\c\nThat’s why those Dynamax Adventures are so\ntough by comparison![VAR 0114(0076)]
Come on now, Chief! We’ve already had us a\nbattle today!\c\nI’ve got to let my Pokémon rest up a bit!\nTry me again tomorrow![VAR 0114(0076)]
Huh?![VAR 0114(0076)]
You actually caught a Pokémon by usin’ that\nmysterious clue?![VAR 0114(0076)]
Let me have a look, would you?[VAR 0114(0076)]
That’s that, anyway...\nChief, mind lettin’ me see that Legendary Clue?[VAR 0114(0076)]
Gaaahahaha!\nI didn’t write this clue, Chief...but let’s not let\r\nthat stop the fun![VAR 0114(0076)]
Erm...excuse me!\nWhere did you find that paper, exactly?!
Chief Peony dropped it...
It was at our base camp...
That’s actually from my notes. I wonder how this\ncould have happened...
Gahahaaa!\nHaven’t got a single shred of an idea![VAR 0114(0076)]
Indeed, sir. I imagine you haven’t.
Anyway, I’m quite relieved that you found\nthat paper.
Not to mention that you’ve caught Necrozma—\nthe one responsible for that Ultra Wormhole.
Please accept this with my thanks as a reward for\nyour cooperation in my research.
Oh, and no need to worry about returning the\npaper. I’ve got another copy.
I’ve got to hand it to you, Chief!\nOnly you could track down and catch a thing\r\nlike that with just a single photo to go on![VAR 0114(0076)]
Still, I’ve got to say...\nFeels like we’ve come to the end of a chapter\r\nor somethin’, doesn’t it?[VAR 0114(0076)]
You look ready to keep on goin’ for a while\nyet, though![VAR 0114(0076)]
Go on then, Chief!\nCan’t wait to hear about all the exploits and\r\nadventures you get up to from here on out![VAR 0114(0076)]
I don’t think that’s the Pokémon from the\nmysterious clue, Chief!\r\nKeep a sharp eye—the game’s still afoot![VAR 0114(0076)]
Hmm. This Pokémon certainly looks like the one\nfrom that mysterious clue. I’ll give you that...\c\nBut somethin’ tells me this Pokémon didn’t come\nfrom this lair!\c\nI know it’s got to be a pain, Chief, but keep\nsearchin’! Slow and steady and all that![VAR 0114(0076)]

Bah! To be defeated in the first battle...\nDid you use Hypnosis?![VAR 0114(0072)]
A final battle without me on the court is\nas bland as curry rice without curry![VAR 0114(0072)]
And so you climb on toward victory, leaving us\nbehind. It vexes me, but...bravo.[VAR 0114(0072)]
Aw, c’mon! All that effort, and nothing to show\nfor it?! What a drag...[VAR 0114(0071)]
So you’re moving on to the final battle, huh?\c\nHey, d’you think we could tag along?\nPleeease? No...?[VAR 0114(0071)]
Second place is better than no place, so I’m\npretty happy![VAR 0114(0071)]
Oof, this is a bit of a disgrace for someone who\nconsiders himself your master![VAR 0114(0073)]
Just as strong as ever, aren’t you?\nGood luck in the final battle![VAR 0114(0073)]
Hee hee hee! That was such a good battle!\nCongratulations, you two—you’ve earned it![VAR 0114(0073)]

Now that was one ultra-mega-heated final battle!\nCongrats on your win, Chief![VAR 0114(0076)]
I didn’t expect to be defeated in round one!\c\nI bet the crowd’s loving getting such intense\nbattles from the get-go![VAR 0114(0004)]
You triumphed against our full power!\c\nGo on to the final battle, then, and show us yet\nanother amazing round![VAR 0114(0004)]
That was a match that’d fit right in at the\nChampion Cup!\c\nGetting the Galarian Star Tournament up\nand running was definitely a good idea.\r\nThanks again![VAR 0114(0004)]
Not even one victory for us?\c\nI can see even the crowd is upset with this\nimprobable turn of events![VAR 0114(000C)]
You defeated us, so you’d better win the final\nmatch. I won’t stand for any other result![VAR 0114(000C)]
Well, of course I was going to let you win. It\nwouldn’t do for the Champion to lose like this.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Aw, I wanted to keep battlin’...\nI guess you win this round, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000D)]
Well, you better make sure you win the\ntournament now—for us![VAR 0114(000D)]

You’ve cut off our flow before it even got going.\nNo wonder you’re the Champion...[VAR 0114(000F)]
Your teamwork was just flawless!\nIt’s enough to make me a bit jealous.[VAR 0114(000F)]
That was the best final match I could have hoped\nfor. Go on now—give the crowd what they want![VAR 0114(000F)]
Defeat is frustrating, but we can use that feeling\nto become stronger. Battle us again sometime![VAR 0114(0010)]
We give our burning desire for victory to you!\nWin the final match for us, OK?[VAR 0114(0010)]
That was a white-hot match, fitting for the final\nbattle of the tournament.\c\nCongratulations, you two![VAR 0114(0010)]
Didn’t even make it past the first gig.\nMarnie’s gonna give me an earful later...[VAR 0114(0016)]
I’m not gonna use not Dynamaxin’ as an excuse.\nYou two were stronger than us—simple as that.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Now that’s what I call strength worthy of a\nChampion. Go on, then—the crowd’s waitin’![VAR 0114(0016)]
I normally look good even when I lose, but losing\nin the first round is just too pathetic.\c\nThe comments on this selfie are gonna be fun...[VAR 0114(0017)]
You defeated the great Raihan!\c\nThat means you have to win the tournament,\nyou hear?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Whoo, that was a good battle!\nGuess I have to concede that your team was\r\nstronger...for now![VAR 0114(0017)]

This new tournament is something else!\nYou never know what to expect![VAR 0114(0014)]
I wanted to at least make it to the final match,\nbut...your teamwork was better than ours.[VAR 0114(0014)]
I thought we had it in the bag!\c\nYou can definitely be proud of defeating\nTeam Gordie![VAR 0114(0014)]
Y-you’re too strong... I bet you’ll have\nno problem in the next match...[VAR 0114(0012)]
The final match won’t be any trouble for you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]... I-I know you’ll win![VAR 0114(0012)]

Well, well, well! You’re certainly off to a\ngood start!\c\nPlease make sure to battle with dignity, like my\ndear brother would![VAR 0114(0069)]

It is an honor to be defeated by you while on\nsuch a glorious stage, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nKeep your back straight, and march onward to\nglory with pride![VAR 0114(0069)]
That’s what I’m talking about, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nYou bring out the strength of your Pokémon\r\nand your partner, too![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’d have looked better losing during the final\nmatch, but I guess it is what it is.\c\nStill, you won’t get me so easy next time, mate!\nGood luck on the next match![VAR 0114(0005)]
Congrats on winning the tournament, mate!\nYou two were something else.\c\nI’m a bit disappointed in myself, but even more\nthan that...I’m happy for you as my rival![VAR 0114(0005)]
You defeated Team Opal right out of the gate.\nNow you need to keep winning, you understand?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Well, I’d hoped we’d be more of a hurdle to you.\nI guess I’ll have my tea in the stands...\r\nOh, don’t worry. I’ll be cheering for you.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Congratulations, child.\c\nI can’t think of a better stage for young, fresh\ntalent to really shine.[VAR 0114(0013)]
It seems like you’ve got yourself a good\nteam, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nI bet you’ll be able to keep going all the way to\nthe finish line![VAR 0114(0074)]
Aw, fiddlesticks! That’s a drag...\c\nOh well. I’m counting on you to promote the\ndojo if you win, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0074)]
[VAR 0100(0000)], you did it!\nCongratulations!\c\nHopefully our final match was impressive enough\nto boost the reputation of the dojo![VAR 0114(0074)]

Even Master Mustard can’t stand in the way of\nour formidable teamwork![VAR 0114(0072)]
Hee hee, that’s the spirit, Avery!\nI guess I’d better go all out if I want to win![VAR 0114(0073)]
We mustn’t lose to the likes of this lout!\nHe abandoned Psychic types altogether![VAR 0114(0072)]
That’s the only reason you made it as the Psychic\nGym Leader. You should be thanking me.[VAR 0114(000C)]
A showdown between two new Gym Leaders!\nI can’t let you win this one.[VAR 0114(000D)]
You’re forgetting that I’m also a leader in\nelegance, making me undeniably superior.[VAR 0114(0072)]
Ah, I sense in you celebrity-ness much like that\nwithin me![VAR 0114(0069)]
And you yourself are quite elegant...\nTell me—do you have a Style Card?[VAR 0114(0072)]
Oh heyyy, Master! We might win by accident...\nSorry if that happens![VAR 0114(0071)]
Luck and accidents are all part of the battle!\nDon’t hold back. I want you to try and beat me![VAR 0114(0073)]
Hee hee! Hi there, Bede!\nGo easy on us, ’K?[VAR 0114(0071)]
Your poison could be trouble.\nI think I’ll knock you out of the match first![VAR 0114(000C)]
Oooh, it’s Marnie! I guess I should show you\nrespect—you’ve been a Gym Leader longer.[VAR 0114(0071)]
Social status don’t mean a thing in battle!\nI’m goin’ all out![VAR 0114(000D)]
Ugh, such tacky makeup and outrageous\nclothing. I see victory in fashion is already mine.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Heeey, are you talkin’ about me?\nI’ll snap that ridiculous hair of yours in two...[VAR 0114(0071)]
Oh, hi there, Peo-kins! I don’t need to hold back\nat all if we’re up against you![VAR 0114(0073)]
Gaaah! Enough with that nickname already!\nDon’t lose your dentures, old man![VAR 0114(0076)]
Woo-hoo! It’s Leon!\nMake sure you go all out, my boy![VAR 0114(0073)]
As if there’s any other way I battle! Come on,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]! It’s super Champion time![VAR 0114(0004)]
A legendary Fighting Gym Leader and former\nChampion... It is an honor to face you.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Oh, no need to be so formal! It never hurts to\nhave a more lighthearted battle now and then![VAR 0114(0073)]
Well, you’re caught up in a face-off between two\nseniors now, Champion. Too bad for you, I guess.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Come now, Opal! We’re still young and full of\nfight! Time for a refreshing battle to prove it![VAR 0114(0073)]
Remember, Leon—I’m done with the League!\nTake it easy on us![VAR 0114(0076)]
You’re forgetting I’m retired, too! Besides, I don’t\nthink I can go easy on you and win![VAR 0114(0004)]
Brace yourself, Peony! Our flames are about to\nmelt through your steel![VAR 0114(0010)]
Burnin’ fierce as ever, aren’t you, Kabu?\nLet’s go, Chief! I’m countin’ on your backup![VAR 0114(0076)]
A two-on-two match isn’t what I’d prefer... Still,\nthe tournament ends for you right here, Leon![VAR 0114(0017)]
It doesn’t matter what kind of match it is, Raihan.\nI won’t lose! Come on—give me all you’ve got![VAR 0114(0004)]
Fancy meeting you on a big stage like this, Hop!\nThis should be a fun match![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’m not gonna lose, Lee! ’Sides, I need to show\n[VAR 0100(0000)] just how good I’ve got![VAR 0114(0005)]
I should hope you’re at least a little bit stronger\nnow, Mr. Wannabe Professor Hop.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Gah, do you ever quit it with the attitude?!\nGuess I’ll show you everything I’ve learned![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll show them the results of your training,\nold la—I mean, Ms. Opal![VAR 0114(000C)]
Almost called me an old lady again, didn’t you?\nMaybe I need to adjust that attitude a bit more.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Don’t you dare go easy just ’cause we’re family,\nBig Bro![VAR 0114(000D)]
I wasn’t plannin’ on it...\nBut it ain’t easy to resist the urge.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Just my luck I’d get pitted against a Grass-type\nuser like you, Milo... But I don’t plan on losing![VAR 0114(000F)]
That’s what I thought! You’ve never been one\nto let type matchups get in the way, Nessa![VAR 0114(000E)]
I’ll need to watch out for you, Kabu. Don’t want\nyou burning all my efforts down![VAR 0114(000E)]
You can’t fool me, Milo! I know your plants aren’t\nthat easy to deal with![VAR 0114(0010)]
Hope you don’t mind me Dynamaxing my\nPokémon, Piers![VAR 0114(000E)]
It’s not like size is the only thing that counts.\nGive ’em everything you’ve got![VAR 0114(0016)]
I guess now’s my chance to get even for my\ndefeat in the Finals, Raihan![VAR 0114(000E)]
You can try, anyway! But I hope you’re ready for\nsome rough weather![VAR 0114(0017)]
I’m sure the type disadvantage won’t slow you\ndown... Right, Kabu?[VAR 0114(000F)]
I would certainly like to live up to your high\nexpectations, Nessa. Let me turn up the heat![VAR 0114(0010)]
Whichever side wins...[VAR 0114(000F)]
...No hard feelings![VAR 0114(0011)]
A battle with you, Nessa? I’d better brace for\na long haul...[VAR 0114(0015)]
All the more room for us to put on a show for\nthe crowd![VAR 0114(000F)]
I have a trick up my sleeve for taking on dragons.\nDon’t get caught off guard, Raihan![VAR 0114(0010)]
Right back at you, Kabu! Whatever trick you\nhave, we’re gonna run right over it![VAR 0114(0017)]
Come on, Piers! Let’s see if you can shut me\ndown with your Dark-type moves![VAR 0114(0017)]
Careful what you wish for! I don’t do encores,\nbut requests are another story![VAR 0114(0016)]
Well, well, well! If it isn’t my spiky-haired friend!\nA fine stepping-stone on my path to glory![VAR 0114(0068)]
Might want to dial down the arrogance.\nPride goes before the fall...[VAR 0114(0016)]
Startin’ to look like a rock star, aren’t you?\nShow me how much you’ve grown![VAR 0114(0016)]
Course, mate! I’m always growing!\nHope you’re ready to be blown away, Piers![VAR 0114(0005)]
I think it’s about time that I inherit the title of\nthe strongest Gym Leader in Galar.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Your Pokémon and your will may be hard as rock,\nbut my dragons will smash right through![VAR 0114(0017)]
I think it’s best if I focus on your dragon\nPokémon, Raihan.[VAR 0114(0015)]
If this were a one-on-one battle, I’d be in for\na rough time... But with my partner, we’ll push\r\nback the cold![VAR 0114(0017)]
Fighting types can be trouble... But I won’t let\nyou shatter us so easily![VAR 0114(0014)]
Then I will simply strike you until you do shatter!\nI hope you’re ready for this, Gordie![VAR 0114(0011)]
I-I’ll do my best, Milo...[VAR 0114(0012)]
That’s the spirit, Allister! I’ll be rooting for you,\neven though we’re on opposite teams![VAR 0114(000E)]
Hello there, Allister! Guess we’re on opposite\nteams this time.[VAR 0114(0015)]
P-please don’t be too harsh on us...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Your mask is beautiful, no matter how many times\nI see it! Are you sure you cannot let me have it?[VAR 0114(0068)]
Uh... N-no, I can’t...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Prepare to witness our celebrity powers, beautiful\nmadam of ice![VAR 0114(0069)]
Well, aren’t we silver-tongued! But don’t think\nyou can sweet-talk me into going easy on you![VAR 0114(0015)]
Well, well, well! If it isn’t my dearest brother!\nWhat a happy coincidence to meet you here![VAR 0114(0068)]
It is nothing short of a miracle, Brother!\nThis is cause for celebration![VAR 0114(0069)]
Hey there, Milo! I hope you’re ready, ’cause I’ve\ngrown stronger since the Gym Challenge![VAR 0114(0005)]
I guess I’d better be ready to be surprised!\nIt’s part of the fun of being the first Gym Leader![VAR 0114(000E)]
I’m still going to win, even without boosts from\ngetting quiz answers correct![VAR 0114(0005)]
You answered all my questions correctly, child...\nAnd I see you’ve got the correct attitude, too![VAR 0114(0013)]
You’re aimin’ to be the best Pokémon Professor\never, right? Better brush up on battles, then![VAR 0114(000D)]
You got that right! I’ll become a professor that’ll\nbe able to go toe-to-toe with Gym Leaders![VAR 0114(0005)]
Why hello there, Hoppy-kins! How’s studying to\nbecome a professor coming along?[VAR 0114(0073)]
I’m taking a break for now! And I’m not about to\nlet even my big bro’s master end my break![VAR 0114(0005)]

Oho! I see some familiar faces!\nNow this reminds me of the Gym Challenge![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hmph. Can’t say that I have too many pleasant\nmemories of that...[VAR 0114(000C)]
C’mon! Let’s see who’s got the strongest![VAR 0114(000D)]
Not too long ago, we were seeing you off at the\nstation, and now you’re the Champion, eh?[VAR 0114(000E)]
Yeah, I remember sending you off with a good\nround of cheering at Motostoke![VAR 0114(0010)]
Time flows like a swift river, doesn’t it?\nI’d rather not think too much about it.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Well now, it’s us three good friends and the\nChampion, all here together![VAR 0114(0010)]
It’s interesting when you think about it. The three\nof us are weak against each other’s types![VAR 0114(000E)]
Not to mention we already know each other’s\nstrategies. This is going to be tricky...[VAR 0114(000F)]
I’ve been training my legs on the hills of Turffield!\nLeave it to me to really dig my heels in![VAR 0114(000E)]
Hey now! I brave the rough waves of Hulbury\nevery day, you know! I’m no pushover![VAR 0114(000F)]
Oh, um, well...\nWe have that lift in Motostoke?[VAR 0114(0010)]
Well! [VAR 0100(0000)], my liege!\nAnd your spiky-haired follower, I see.[VAR 0114(0068)]
Guess there’s no point hopin’ the pair of you’ll\never lose yer rude streak, huh?[VAR 0114(0016)]
True celebrities change not their attitude, even\nif they have a change of heart![VAR 0114(0069)]
You’ve developed a nice depth to your battle\ntechnique, boy.[VAR 0114(0013)]
No need to flatter me, Opal. Compared to you\ntwo, I’m just a whippersnapper![VAR 0114(0010)]
Oh, come off it! You’ve got the air of a seasoned\nveteran! Way more than me, actually![VAR 0114(0073)]
We’re taking on Leon?\nGreat. Now my partner’ll never shut up...[VAR 0114(0016)]
Raihan always goes all out against me, but you’d\nbetter give your best too, Piers![VAR 0114(0004)]
Leon’s mine, Piers!\nDon’t get in my way![VAR 0114(0017)]
[VAR 0100(0000)] and Piers, huh?\nThat’s a fun combination![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’ve got my hands full just keepin’ up with all of\n[VAR 0100(0000)]’s shenanigans, really.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Is that so? Well, you’d both better be ready,\nbecause I’ve got some shenanigans of my own![VAR 0114(0017)]

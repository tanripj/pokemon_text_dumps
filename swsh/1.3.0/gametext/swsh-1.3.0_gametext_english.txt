The King of Bountiful Harvests
There’s a fairy tale in Freezington about the\nLegendary Pokémon known as the King of Bountiful\nHarvests. In the legends, the king is said to wear a\nmassive crown on its head, but the wooden statue\nnear the fields in the middle of the village shows no\nsign of a crown.
Calyrex appeared once I placed the crown on the\nstatue of the King of Bountiful Harvests.\nCalyrex can apparently speak to humans by taking\nover a person’s body—Peony’s, in this case. Now I\nneed to gather more information on the King of\nBountiful Harvests from the people of the village!
In order to find the king’s beloved steed, I’ll need\nto first get my hands on its favorite food—carrots.\nMaybe the people of Freezington can help me out.
Upon hearing that I was able to find Carrot Seeds,\nCalyrex told me about two fields where I can grow\nthe carrots. I need to pick either the field covered in\nsnow or the field by the graves and plant the seeds!
Calyrex was able to grow an Iceroot Carrot from the\nseeds I planted in the field covered in snow! The\nscent of the carrot lured Glastrier out, but it ran off\ntoward Freezington.
Calyrex was able to grow a Shaderoot Carrot from\nthe seeds I planted in the field by the graves! The\nscent of the carrot lured Spectrier out, but it ran off\ntoward Freezington.
Using the mane hair I got by defeating the Pokémon\nthat was once the king’s loyal steed along with the\nRadiant Petal grown by Calyrex itself, I was able\nto re-create the Reins of Unity!\nNow I need to head to the Crown Shrine, where the\nsteed’s been living, to meet up with Calyrex!
Calyrex, the King of Bountiful Harvests, was able\nto reconnect with its loyal steed using the new Reins\nof Unity. Calyrex also seems to have regained its\ntrust in humankind. As thanks for helping it regain its\npower, Calyrex is allowing me to take it along on\nmy adventure!

It’s common manners for Pokémon Trainers to\nbattle when their eyes meet.
Whenever there’s a strong Trainer, I always look\nright at them...
If you don’t want to battle, it’s important to\nmake sure you aren’t seen by other people\r\nwhen you’re walking around.
I couldn’t beat Hop, but I’m gonna beat you!
Lose to wild Pokémon... Lose to many Trainers...
Pokémon hiding in the tall grass or Trainers\nwaiting along the route—which one you choose\r\nis up to you!
Cute and strong, together in combination!
Are we cute and nothing more? It looks like our\nstrength still has a ways to go...
Pokémon have types.\c\nFire is strong against Grass, Grass is strong\nagainst Water, and Water is strong against Fire.\r\nRemember that, and you’ll get really strong!
Young Pokémon Trainer, won’t you honor\nme with a battle?
Oho? It seems you’re already quite used to\nPokémon battles...
I’m someone who can’t help but look forward to\nseeing how strong you’ll get.\r\nI’ll support you from now on!
[~ 15]
[~ 16]
[~ 17]
You saw the opening ceremony, right? Then you\nknow why I’m excited and want to battle!
I lost! But I’m still excited!
I’m gonna participate in the Gym Challenge\nnext year!
I’ve been studying foreign languages, computers,\nand Pokémon!
What?! I lost... My Pokémon savvy wasn’t enough?
I should find even more about Pokémon to like—\nthat way, I’ll learn more about them.\c\nLike how if you lower their HP, they get easier\nto catch!
Oh! Instead of a Pokémon, I found a Trainer!\nI’ll have to check how strong you are!
Yeowch! Your Pokémon [VAR 1101(00FD,0302)]isare way too strong!
Losing’s really painful, so I’ll raise my partner\nPokémon, too!
Were you thinking of passing through without\neven looking at my Pokémon?
Win or lose, I don’t mind! I just wanted to show\noff my Pokémon!
If we’re talking who’s poured more love into their\nPokémon, I’m clearly the winner!
I’ll show you what I carry! Letters and victory!
Turns out I was carrying your victory.
Letters filled with thoughts and emotions...\nOne must carry them gently.
Every Pokémon’s got a type or two. And every\ntype has strong points and weak ones.
I’m weak to people older than me...
Try switching Pokémon when you’ve got a bad\nmatchup in battle!
My work partner and I are in perfect sync even\nin battle!
Hmm. Looks like we weren’t in sync...
We’re in perfect sync when we work\ntogether, though...
Working women are good at Pokémon battles, too!
Your Pokémon... I want to scout [VAR 1101(00FD,0402)]itthem!
Working Pokémon have a special something that\nreally shines!
In order to do good work, I can’t slack off\non training!
You made for some good training.
Training is important in all things. Persevering\nwith your training is even more important!
I was looking around for items, but I found\na Trainer.
If only I’d used an item effectively when I was in\na pinch.
Use items you pick up. They’re like a gift\nfrom someone.
I’m doing special training while camping to train\nmy Pokémon! The finishing touch will be a\r\nbattle with you!
I was sure my Pokémon were in top condition...
My special training... I played and ate so much\ntasty food, and it didn’t even work?
Fifty years of raising Pokémon! Did you come to\nsee the progress of my work?
Well, I didn’t raise them for 50 years.
I see! Even if Pokémon are in top shape, if the\nBreeder is really just a beginner, it’s tough to win!
What do you think? I look just like a\nPikachu, right?
Pikaaa?!
I thought it’d be a really good strategy to distract\nyou by having you think both the Trainer and\r\nthe Pokémon were Pikachu...
I’m an Eevee! I’m full of possibilities!
I’m an Eevee... I’m downhearted because I lost.
I’m an Eevee! When I grow up, what type of\nPokémon do you think I’ll evolve into?
Appearing with a “Pika!”
I’m so downhearted...
I’ll go take a kip and rest comfortably inside\na Poké Ball!
OK, now I say, “A wild Poké Kid appeared!”
Oh... It’s already over.
I dress like this because I want to understand the\nfeelings of Pokémon.
Welcome, Gym Challenger! Sorry, but I’ll have to\nsend you packing. It’s my job.
As expected! A Gym Challenger and their\nPokémon are in perfect sync with each other!
Whoa! When you beat a Gym Trainer, the Gym’s\nYamper will stand still for a bit.\c\nWhich means your Gym mission gets a tad easier!
I wonder if your Pokémon want[VAR 1101(00FD,0001)]s to use [VAR 1101(00FD,0503)]itstheir\nmoves with all [VAR 1101(00FD,0503)]itstheir strength and feel great.
I’ll give a “bow wark” instead of Yamper!
Youth! Open the gate! Seize the future!
The Gym Leader lies just ahead of you!\nBut that doesn’t mean you’ll be reaching him.
Next is the Gym Leader, right? What a\nstrong challenger...
Many Gym Challengers come here to battle,\nbut...there’s something that really shines\r\nabout you!
’Ello, ’ello, what’s all this then?\nFancy a scrap with a copper?
You’ve got some Pokémon with you there.\nYour battle technique is bang on, too!
You should have no problems traveling alone.\nI’ve seen enough to know you can\r\nhandle yourself.
Time for a special interview with a Gym\nChallenger! The best way to get to know you is\r\na Pokémon battle, of course!
Since I’m gathering information, you should bring\nat least two Pokémon.
It’s hard to describe it in just a few words—\nwhat incredible potential!
With your strength, you’re sure to keep winning\nduring your Gym Challenge! Please let me get\r\nan interview again sometime!
Good Pokémon and Trainers really shine on-camera!
You need at least two Pokémon to take me on.
I lost! Does that mean the interview is ruined?
Your Pokémon look great even when I view them\nthrough the camera!
I’d like to show you my Pokémon that have grown\nso well.
I wasn’t sure which moves to use and got lost\nin thought.
I was chased by Pokémon in the tall grass and\nended up wandering aimlessly.
Oho! I found a Trainer whilst gathering Berries!
I should have given my Pokémon a Berry when its\nHP got low...
Different Pokémon love different Berries,\nso you’ve got to gather a lot of different kinds!
My partner Pokémon’s been growing in a really\nunique way. Check it out.
Pokémon are living creatures after all. You can’t\nalways raise them how you want.
Raising Pokémon unselfishly means that they’ll\nshow you their new capabilities.
Keep this to yourself, but...\nI’m having Pokémon help with my work.
You’re a Trainer who’s stronger than me and the\nPokémon that can do my work.
When I get stuck with my work, I have my\nPokémon pet me.
Work to raise the good points of a Pokémon.\nDon’t...don’t worry about its bad points.
I’ll accept that I lost, but I’m not gonna let it\nbother me that much.
More than focusing on what you can’t do, it’s\nimportant to enjoy what you can do in life!
Welcome to Hulbury Stadium! Ready to bask\nin the beauty of Water-type moves?
Huh? Tympole and I were the ones who\ngot soaked?
A battle between you and Gym Leader Nessa is\nsure to excite Gym Challenge fans!
Pressing a button stops the water...but you’ve\ngot to think about the order, too.
I wasn’t sure about the right thing to do in\nthat battle...
The order of the buttons... There’s only one right\norder to press them all in.
What? You made it this far? And you want to...\nbattle me?
With that strength, it’s no wonder you beat me\nand my Pokémon...
Usually the last Trainer in a Gym is pretty strong,\nbut I don’t have a lot of confidence, so they let\r\nme stay back here...
When I’m tired of work, it’s time for a battle!\nI’ll show you the muscles I’ve built up!
The muscles I use for work and for battle\nare different!
This is just something I overheard, but...\c\nTwo Pokémon of the same species can have\ndifferent strengths!
My Pokémon is bursting with energy. What I\nmean to say is...please battle me!
A loss is a loss! My Pokémon lost its energy, too!
When you’ve got too much energy, you need to\nlet those feelings out. Battles are a good way to\r\ndo that.
Steam power can send any opponent flying!
What incredible power! Guess I was the one\nsent flying.
Railways were built all across the Galar region a\nlong time ago when the steam engine was built.
My supercute Pokémon is interested in\nyour Pokémon.
Your Pokémon [VAR 1101(00FD,0302)]isare way too strong! You’ll be safe\nno matter where you go.
My supercute Clefairy can evolve by using some\nkind of stone, I think!
Battling is important to better understand Pokémon.
We want to see more than one Pokémon.
Ah! I just get so, so, so concerned when I see\ninjured Pokémon.
The world would be a better place if there was\nno need for doctors.
Time for a checkup!
I want to check lots of Pokémon. Two! Bring at\nleast two!
What is real strength? I’m very curious!
A strong Trainer understands their Pokémon\nbetter than anyone else in the world.
I came from far away to watch the\nGym Challenge. I’d love the opportunity to\r\nbattle a Gym Challenger.
Muy dramático! Fantástico!
The Gym Challenge sure looks tough. You can’t\nget ahead if you don’t win. I think we’ll just\r\ncontinue our carefree journey.
A model who’s also strong in battle—that’s who\nI am.
Even if I lose who I am, the charm of Pokémon\nwill never fade.
Even compared to Pokémon, I should still\nstand out... Probably!
Are you making curry? Are you filling your\nCurry Dex?
The strength of you and your Pokémon has made\nmy mouth go numb!
I’m so hooked on the Curry Dex that gathering\ningredients has become the main focus\r\nof my travels!
Pokémon is art, too, if we both give it our all!
Your moves were beautiful... Oh my, I’m\ncompletely fascinated by them.
The greatest art is drawn from Pokémon and their\nTrainer in a battle!
You look pretty dizzy. Are you sure you can\nbattle in that condition?
I’m dizzy... No, I’m completely dazzled. What an\nincredible battle!
You have something special in you. Bring out your\nwonderful talent.
Our Gym mission is like a theme-park attraction!\nWhat do you think?
What a formidable battle style! I can feel a good\nsense of balance coming from you.
I purposely spin around to get myself dizzy.\nThat way, I can train my balance.
Our job is to defeat all the reckless\nGym Challengers!
Thank you for reminding me of what it was like to\nbe a Gym Challenger!
I want to support strong Gym Challengers!\nKeep winning through to the end!
Spin the teacups too much, and Gym Challengers\ngo flying!
I lost. My consciousness has been sent flying.
Gym Challenger! Just how high will you fly?\nDon’t tie yourself down.
Back and forth, back and forth—you’re spinning.\nBack and forth, back and forth—me too.
Losing made me remember...the Gym Leader\nwears a mask...
Beneath the Gym Leader’s mask...\nWhat does he look like? I wonder...
Can you understand what Ghost-type Pokémon\nare weak to? I don’t think so.
If you understand type matchups, it’s only natural\nthat it’d be easier to win.
Even if you don’t hit weaknesses, it’s fine as long\nas you win, right?
Are you looking for mushrooms? They give off\nlight when you touch them!
Hey, a strong Trainer! That’s rarer than\nrare mushrooms!
It’s said that there’re some rare mushrooms in\nGlimwood Tangle, so I’m hoping to make some\r\ngood curry if I find any.
Some mushrooms react in interesting ways when\nyou touch them.
Madames like me react in sad ways when\nwe’re defeated...
Mushrooms that you touch will start glowing...\c\nBut their glowing dims as time goes by.
The railways are amazing! They can carry lots of\npeople and Pokémon at once!
One’s not enough! I like a battle with lots\nof Pokémon.
A good way to forget the trouble of this loss\nwould be to ride the train.
The railways are amazing! Watching the scenery\nrush by out the window and arriving at the\r\nstation... What an incredible time!
I came to ride a Galar train...\nI wonder if meeting you will change my life.
A battle with lots of Pokémon! Bring at least\ntwo Pokémon!
Too strong... Guess I’ll look for someone I can\nactually beat...
There are lots of people more and less amazing\nthan you, so don’t mind others too much.
As a model, I’ll show off the appeal of\nmy partner Pokémon!
What a great Trainer you are! You really showed\noff the appeal of your partner Pokémon.
I want to become someone everyone wants to\nbe like...just like the Champion!
Being a taxi driver means I’ve got to be ready\nanytime, anywhere. Pokémon battles are\r\nthe same...anytime, anywhere.
No matter where I go in my taxi, loss and\nloneliness seem to follow...
One of the troubling things about being a driver\nis that sometimes Corviknight will take off and\r\nforget the customer.
I acknowledge your strength. Please indulge me\nin a contest of strength and wits.
Ah, see? Exactly as I had thought.
To live without making enemies... That is the way\nof a gentleman.
I shall now closely examine the health of\nyour Pokémon.
When Pokémon aren’t healthy, it drags our mood\ndown, too.
When people are healthy, they tend not to\nrealize how valuable that health is.
You can compare life to a journey, but the end\nof your life isn’t the same as a journey’s goal.
Even if you fail, it’s not the end. You can stand up\nand fight back.
I’ve met and battled many Gym Challengers.\nI hope everyone reaches their goals.
My live concert is open to all, and you’ll\nbe attending!
Hmm, guess the rhythm between me and my\npartner was off.
One day...I really want to jam with Piers...
Succeeding as a businessman depends on\ncommunication. I get along perfectly with\r\nmy Pokémon!
This should be special, so show me at least\ntwo Pokémon!
I’ll sell this victory to you! I’m short on\npocket change!
Let me check my schedule! There’s nothing to be\ngained by fretting over a loss!
I’m super cute, but I’m carrying\nsuperduper-strong Pokémon!
Seriously? Only one Pokémon? I don’t want to\nbattle you like that.
Your Pokémon [VAR 1101(00FD,0302)]isare strong AND cute?!
I’m strong and cute, so Pokémon that are strong\nand cute suit me best.
Gym Challenger, if it’s all right, I will be your\ntraining partner.
My Pokémon did their best but they couldn’t\ncompete! Good luck in the future!
A long time ago, police officers used to ride on\nhorse Pokémon.
Hey, you used to walking around in Circhester\nStadium yet?
You battled so confidently... I see! You’ve got to\nhave confidence!
The trick to walking around here is to be careful\nbut confidently press on straight forward.\r\nThat should work.
Rock types are really, really, really,\nreally amazing!
Did I...make you understand how amazing\nRock types are?
Rock types have higher Sp. Def during a\nsandstorm—they become super tough.\r\nThat’s why they’re amazing!
Gordie’s amazing qualities... Number one!\nHe’s cool and fashionable!
Gordie’s amazing qualities... Number two!\nHe’s lively and stylish!
Gordie’s amazing qualities... Number three!\nHe’s popular with girls! Ugh! I want to be\r\nlike that!
Gym Challenger! I know you’re there.
Even though I knew you were there, I couldn’t\nsee a path to victory.
The path you will follow... I see that it’s a road\nof victory.
As long as I’ve got Ice-type Pokémon with me,\nI can stay totally chill.
What?! There’s no way I could lose!
As long as I’ve got Ice-type Pokémon with me,\nI can stay totally chill...
Gym Challenger, I’ll freeze you and your\nPokémon solid and shatter you into tiny pieces.
I got smashed to tiny pieces...along with my pride...
Ice types don’t freeze! They have a lot of\nweaknesses, but I won’t stop loving them.
Gym Challenger, are you aiming to battle\nMelony, too?
Oh no! She might get cross at me if she hears I\nlost to a challenger.
Melony is merciless when she battles to ensure\nthat she’ll win. It’s not a fighting style that\r\neveryone likes, but that’s all right.
Continue forward, even if you can’t see where\nyou’re going. That’s Circhester Stadium’s\r\nGym mission.
Just like you won because you believed in your\nPokémon, believe in yourself and move forward.
Don’t get careless. I thought I’d reached the end\nwhen I suddenly fell in a pit.
Meeting a Trainer can only mean battle! What a\nsimple concept.
The stronger one always wins. How simple...
See the image and cast your line. It’s simple...\nThat means it’s profound...
My Pokémon are all pumped up from dancing\nwith me. Are you ready for us?
Wow! You and your Pokémon make a combo that\nthrows out moves like an elegant dance!
I want my Pokémon to learn some moves that are\nlike dancing.
Witness the results of the training I did together\nwith Pokémon!
Hiyah! I lost! Looks like I’ll need more training!
If I give it everything I got, then maybe I’ll be\nable to beat the Champion... Maybe.
Aim for your opponent’s weak spots, and strike!\nThat’s all there is to it.
To use four moves... That’s all it should take!
I heard that a long time ago there was a great\ndetective in Galar who used a martial art\r\ncalled baritsu...
Whether it’s fishing or Pokémon battles,\ntype matchups are important!
Losing with a spiky Pokémon makes my heart\nfeel prickly.
No matter how good you are at fishing, if you\ntry to fish where there are no Pokémon, you\r\nwon’t find anything!
I’ve finished all my warm-ups! OK, let’s battle\nwith everything we’ve got!
I got tired from the warm-ups. My Pokémon and\nI gave it too much.
Doing things in moderation is important, but it\njust doesn’t feel satisfying.
Swimming trains muscles! Muscles launch moves!
To deal with the shock of losing, I’m going\nto swim far, far away.
There are swimming experts who can swim all the\nway to the Kalos region.
I’m all rested up, so how about you be\nmy opponent?
I’m a mermaid... I want to return to the ocean...
I was looking for Berries to let my Pokémon hold.
I’m doing research to see if one day I can swim\nanywhere with my beloved Toxapex.
Is this the limit of Water types? No, I can still\ncome up with more!
I wonder if I added a fin to a swimsuit, would I\nbe able to swim faster?\c\nBut Toxapex doesn’t really swim all that often.
Sing! Dance! Let’s make this a party hall!
I always end up singing a depressing song when\nI lose...
If Pokémon and moves are mixed in, too, we’ll\nhave an amazing vibe!
Who cares about losing... Guess I’ll just sing an\nannoying song.
If I dance, I shine! My Pokémon shines\nbrighter, too!
It’s a team, so it’d be better if you had at\nleast two Pokémon!
Dancing is the best way to stay healthy!
I wouldn’t have lost if it was a dance battle!\nWe should both focus on our strengths.
Do you have any injured Pokémon? I’m a doctor.
What’s this, what’s this? My Pokémon ended\nup injured.
A strong Trainer like you has probably seen many\ninjured Pokémon... Must be pretty tough.
Only do what you can. Taking risks while\nmountain climbing is dangerous.
You won’t be able to beat a strong opponent\nwithout pushing the limits of what’s possible.
Slowly increasing what you can do is a good way\nto level yourself up.
Waha! A Pokémon Trainer! What should I do?\nI don’t really want to battle.
I think I got mixed up somewhere around my\nfirst Pokémon.
I lost, but there was a lot that I learned.\nSo in that way, I actually won!
The post... I wonder just how long we can keep\non carrying letters like this.
I lost... When I think about it...\nI didn’t want it to ever end!
The feelings of letters only gain meaning after\nthey are delivered to people. Even if it was the\r\nlast letter ever sent, I’d carry it no matter what!
Do you know the old legend that says that Galar\nis doomed if Corviknight ever disappear?
I actually don’t know much about the old\nCorviknight legend...
I pride myself on my strong Corviknight that\ncarries customers while flying.
I get more nervous about battles than work...
When I do business, I’m called a businessman.\nSo when I battle, should I be called a battleman?
Being together with Pokémon...\nIt’s really amazing if you think about it.

The way you carry yourself... You are something!
Oh! Your Pokémon [VAR 1101(00FD,0302)]isare simply marvelous!
In Galar, we’ve shown our dear Pokémon to each\nother and shown respect to each other since\r\nancient times.
It’s been a while! I’m glad we could meet up\nagain. Let’s see how strong you’ve gotten.
Since I’m gathering information, you should bring\nat least two Pokémon.
What strength! I’m at a loss for words...\nNice work, everyone!
If you win the Gym Challenge, I’ll be requesting\nan exclusive interview.
Great Pokémon and Trainers really shine with\nsomething special when they’re on-camera!
You need at least two Pokémon to take me on.
I lost! But it’s all right. I was able to assess\nyour strength.
I can’t stop watching your Pokémon from through\nthe camera lens! They’ve got some kind of aura\r\nabout them!
The power of Grass has wilted...\nWhat an incredible Gym Challenger!
I may proudly be the strongest member of this\nGym, but I was totally washed away!
[VAR 1101(00FD,0103)]A gGreat Pokémon and a great Trainer! It’s no\nsurprise that you won!
You beat my two Pokémon with your one?!\nYou and that Grookey are too much!
You beat my two Pokémon with your one?!\nYou and that Scorbunny are too much!

I came to see the Gym Challenge openin’\nceremony, but this is awful!
You and your Pokémon broke through!
I wasn’t able...to properly greet you.
I lost! My leg pain’s back, so it’s a double shock!
Huh? Seriously? You’ve gotta be kiddin’...\nIt’s over already? Wha—?!
It would’ve been better if you’d just lost to us...
Did I lose as a member of Team Yell? Or was I\nbeaten as a Gym Trainer?
We both got ourselves the same Grass Badge,\nso how come you’re so much stronger?!

*sigh*\nI wanna go back to Spikemuth. I really do.
What’s with that?! My Pokémon didn’t get a\nchance to really do their thing at all. Ugh!
I might have lost, but I still look good.\nMaybe I should snap a quick selfie...
OK, so I lost... But I got to see a lot of the good\npoints of you and your Pokémon!

My time as Champion is over...\nBut what a champion time it’s been!\c\nThank you for the greatest battle I’ve ever had!
If you stand your ground with everything you got,\nit doesn’t matter what’s right or wrong.
To be cautious and wary—that’s the trick\nto survival.
I play a strong Trainer. I’m a method actor, so I\nbecame a Trainer in real life, too.

Doubles... There’s a lot to think about with them.\nIt makes them difficult, but fun, too!
The weather is fickle! Victory and defeat are even\nmore fickle!
Cooperation between Trainers and their Pokémon\njust brings out their strength even more!
Team Yell’s supposed to be helping out, but they\njust don’t know when to quit...
I wasn’t sure if it was better to try to mess with\nyour head or concentrate on your Pokémon.\c\nAnd I was the one who ended up losing focus.
Did I lose as a member of Team Yell?\nOr was I beaten as a Gym Trainer?
You handle the rest! I’ll leave ’em to you!\nI’m sure you can handle this!

Ugh! Why d’you ’ave to be such a bother?!
You had no problem handling our surging might.\nIt’s no wonder that you won.
Your strength nearly made me want to turn and\nrun in my bare feet!
Maybe my mask...kept me from seeing just how\nstrong you really are...

Galar’s in trouble. Why am I wasting time\nlike this?!

It’s time to prove I’m a notch above the\ncompetition to everyone in the Galar region.\r\nThough I suppose everyone should know by now.
Why did I have the misfortune of being born in\nthe same time period as you...?
If it weren’t for you, then I could prove beyond\ndoubt that I am the best...\c\nStill, I do enjoy my battles with you...to a degree.
Don’t think I’m the same Milo as in the\nGym Challenge! You’re the great Champion,\r\nafter all. It’d be rude not to go all out!
The power of Grass has been wilted...\nYou’re quite the Champion!
Soon you’ll be the one to face down Gym\nChallengers aiming for your title.\r\nI can’t wait to see what talent grows!
I’m sure you remember, but I’m Nessa.\c\nAnd I’m not here to chat. I’m here to win!
I just don’t get it. What do I gotta do to beat\nyou, huh?
I have my best team, and we train and we train...\nBut then you’re always just one step ahead.\c\nMaybe that’s why I can’t stop thinking about you.
A tournament that ends when you lose!\nWhoever can keep up the heat will win!
[VAR 1101(00FD,0103)]A gGood Pokémon and a great Trainer! It’s no\nsurprise that you won!
I really enjoy battling you. It’s a great way for me\nto feel my own growth!\c\nAnd I plan to keep growing and battling, until I\nbecome an old coot that nobody can beat!
Focusing too much on winning can cause one to\nmake mistakes. I will face you with a clear head!
Your Pokémon... They’re so strong, they’re\npractically dizzying!
I want to achieve so many different things during\nbattles. It’s hard to decide sometimes...\r\nI still have much to learn.
...Let’s start the match.
I’m glad I had my mask...\nI was making quite the face just now...
...The only reason I can battle in front of so many\npeople without completely losing my cool is\r\nthanks to you, Champion.\c\nBattles with you are so absorbing that they simply\nmake me forget myself or where I am.
Well, it’s a pleasure to have a chance to play with\nyou again. No quizzes this time! I’m going all out!
You’re starting to have enough pink about you.\nFigure out for yourself what I mean by pink!
I wanted to make sure Bede was doing a proper\njob as a Gym Leader, so I decided to join.\c\nThough to be honest, things are rather boring\nsince I retired, so this is the perfect distraction.
I’ve got nothing to say. I’m here to win.
I’ve been crushed! I pride myself on my solid\nPokémon, and yet this...
Sorry to lose my cool...\nI’ll be sure to challenge you again.
So what are your top 10 favorite Pokémon?\c\n...That’s just how I break the ice. Are you ready\nfor a Pokémon battle now?
I think you took breaking the ice a little\ntoo literally...
It helps inspire my Gym Trainers if I participate\nin this tournament from time to time!\c\nMy only choice is to keep aiming for that\ngrand victory!
I’ll get the audience pumped up, even without\nusin’ Dynamax!
That’s it?! Piers doesn’t do encores, but I admit\nI’m tempted right now!
Battlin’ you makes me wanna try out a new\nbattle style. Maybe a Pokémon battle and a\r\ngig combined. What do you think, huh?\c\nCould sound battles be a thing?
I’m going to defeat the Champion, win the whole\ntournament, and prove to the world just how\r\nstrong the great Raihan really is!
I look this good even when I lose. It’s a real\ncurse. Guess it’s time for another selfie!
Considering how many likes the photos of my\ndefeats to you get, I bet a victory photo would\r\njust explode!\c\nWait... Have I got my priorities mixed up?
If I want people to properly respect me as the\nnew Spikemuth Gym Leader, I need to show\r\njust how amazin’ I am by defeatin’ you!
I mean, if you’re gonna win, you could at least\nwin in a way that makes me look good, right?
I’ve been losin’ to you since the Gym\nChallenge, and I’m gettin’ a bit fed up!\c\nYou’d better battle me again!
I didn’t do as well in the Gym Challenge as I’d\nhoped, but...this tournament is different!\r\nYou’ll see!
That was not what I wanted!\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no! NO!
I’m going to keep participating in this tournament\nuntil I’m satisfied! So you should keep coming,\r\ntoo, Champion!
I’m going to prove beyond doubt that Bug-type\nPokémon are strong and competitive!
Losing really bugs me!
I mean, there are different ways to be strong,\nright? I try not to let losing bring me down.\c\nPeople say I’ve got a tough spirit!
I’m going to soar to the highest point, just like\nthe Pokémon gracefully flying across the sky!
Oh no... Knocked down to the ground...
I’ll be flying again in no time!\nOnce I find a good air current...
My sponsor is here watching me today!\nI can’t have a pathetic battle!
Of all the days to lose, I lose today...
I get in trouble if I lose too much.\nThey say it damages the company’s brand.
Seeing you plow through the Gym Challenge was\na real inspiration for me...\r\nBut today, I came to win!
I think it’s always important to think about what\nyou can learn from your losses.
Thank you, Champion!\c\nI’ll use this experience to review how I battle\nand reevaluate my strategies.
I traveled all the way to the Kanto region to train\nmy karate!\c\nBehold the graceful moves of the Fighting Dojo!
My refined moves had no effect...\nYou’re just too amazing!
I’ve been told to start over every time I am\ndefeated, but to be honest I just wanted to\r\nbe with my Pokémon.
People think I’m edgy just because I love\nPoison-type Pokémon!
Losing doesn’t bother me, but I’m bummed that\nI couldn’t cover you in venom! Blaaah!
Poison can actually become medicine if it’s used\nproperly. Nothing edgy about it!
I prefer these tournaments over the Battle Tower.\nIt’s nice to have an audience!
Oh man, everyone just saw me get crushed...\nHow embarrassing!
I need to redeem myself! I’m gonna retrain my\nwhole team and make myself famous as a\r\nGhost-type user!
Even ice cannot be broken once it becomes\na glacier!
The strength I just showed you was only the tip\nof the iceberg!
I know, I know... If I can’t show it during matches,\nI can’t claim to have hidden strength.
I am grateful for this chance to defeat the\nChampion, even though the Gym Challenge\r\nis over!
Your Pokémon are so strong, it’s like I’m battling\nthe very land of the Galar region!
Now I know why I couldn’t beat you during the\nGym Challenge...\c\nBut I promise someday I will become strong—as\nstrong as the lands of Galar!
I’ll let the growth of plants overwhelm you!
Oh...\nI was overwhelmed.
Milo’s as stubborn as weeds, but...\nI still have a long way to go...
The Trainers of the Galar region need to give the\naudience a good show.\c\nThat means we need to show our strength!
Ele-shock! ...Huh? Oh, that means I’m shocked\nas an Electric-type user.
Even when I’m defeated, I try to give the match\nmy all and shock the audience in a good way!
I use powerful Dragon-type Pokémon.\nIf I’m not strong, then who is?
I couldn’t bring out the true strength of my\nDragon-type Pokémon...
I suppose a Trainer must be able to bring out the\ntrue potential of their Pokémon!
I’ve built my reputation by building up one win\nat a time. Think you can bring me down?
It only takes one defeat for everything I’ve built\nto come crashing down...
My pride was hard as steel too, but you really\npunched a hole through that.
So, I have a chance to battle the Champion?\nThis tournament’s a great deal!
Well, there goes the burning flame of\nmy ambition...
I guess all I got out of the tournament was a\nlesson on how strong the Champion is...
Heh heh heh! I hope that battle was a delicate,\nsweet taste for you!
Don’t suddenly talk to me like that!\nI accidentally turned around!
And I even switched up my Pokémon while I\nwas running...
Hiding didn’t work, and battles didn’t work...\nOnly thing to do now is run!
It’s frustratin’ that we weren’t able to go\ntoe-to-toe with a Dynamax Pokémon for longer...
Don’t think I’m the same Milo as in the\nGym Challenge! You’re the great Champion,\r\nafter all. It’d be rude not to go all out!
The power of Grass has been wilted...\nYou’re quite the Champion!
Soon you’ll be the one to face down Gym\nChallengers aiming for your title.\r\nI can’t wait to see what talent grows!
My voice is unsure when I’m sad...\nI wanna yell, but I’m unsure...
Me an’ my team gave it our best. Let’s meet up\nfor a battle again some time...
We’ve created an extraordinary lift that’s\nsafe even for a Pokémon battle.
This building’s well over five hundred feet tall.\c\nThat’s as tall as around one hundred Machoke\nstanding on top of each other.
You ever get that floaty feeling when a lift\nis going up?
Sorry! I’ll leave the rest to you!
Sorry! I’ll leave the rest to you!
Sorry! I’ll leave the rest to you!
You must be pretty amazing to have beaten me!\nYou’re a regular Wild Area expert!

Oh, my next Pokémon’s gonna make short work of—\nHuh? That was my last one?
[~ 560]
What a Psystrike to my poor pride...
[~ 562]
Just what have you got that I don’t?
[~ 564]
Oh, I could just Imprison myself for this!
[~ 566]
But I didn’t hold back!\nI gave it everything I’ve got...
[~ 568]
That was everything I hoped for and more!
[~ 570]
You young folk grow so fast!\nIt never ceases to amaze me.

Guess it’s not my place to be braggin’!
[~ 588]
Light and dark aside, you have certainly\nbroadened my perspective!
[~ 590]
I did not get the chance to adapt!
[~ 592]
Now the darkness surrounds me... I am about\nto blackout!
[~ 594]
Your strength does not yield to cold or heat!
[~ 596]
I have been swallowed whole by your\ngreat strength!
[~ 598]
Yes, even my strength perfected in light can be\novershadowed at times!
[~ 600]
Each one of your raindrops hit like a\nHydro Pump!
[~ 602]
It seems you have found your path and sailed right\non course!
Fine moves, fine Pokémon... A fine battle from a\nfine team!
Fine moves, fine Pokémon... A fine battle from a\nfine team!
I suppose I’ll concede to your team...this time!
You two’ve got real coordination. I respect that...\nThough it doesn’t take the bite out of losin’!
That was some brilliant teamwork! Thanks a lot\nfor the heart-pounding match!
This aching in my knees will be the fuel that\nsends me surging to new heights of strength!
The pair of us got washed clean away!
My throat’s ragged from shoutin’...but that’s\n’cause it was just that excitin’ a battle!
...Y-your coordination was so dazzling, it shone\nright through my mask.
I fought on to the end and still lost... Well, that’s\nfine. Long as I fight on to the end next time!
Time to make sure my uniform and head are\nboth on straight and go do some more training.
At least when we fall, we fall like glorious,\nfluttering rose petals...as celebrities should!
Nice one, you two!\nThat was a real nail-biter of a match!

What a powerful team! It gives me the deepest\nof chills.
We may fight as one, but it looks like we’re still a\nways off from being a true monolith.
This isn’t the future my Future Sight foretold!
I lost in front of all these people!\nWhat a sheer disgrace...
You two make a team as fierce as\nsharpened steel! Even I’ve gotta tap out!
My sole concern is whether you enjoyed yourself,\nyoung M[VAR 1100(00FF,0205)]asters. [VAR 0189(0000)].
That was such a fine showing of teamwork that\nI’m ready to take you both on as farmhands!
That was the perfect distraction. Just what I’d\nhoped for from the Champion’s team!

I want to become a legend in Galar...\nNo, a legend for the whole world!\c\nAnd if I want to do that, I need to beat both you\nand my big bro!
Ugh! Gutted!\nYou’re always one step ahead of me, mate!
Even the pages detailing my defeats will add to\nthe tale of my brilliant legend!\c\nBut I don’t plan on losing to you again!\nAs your rival, I promise I’ll win next time!

Don’t think I’m the same Milo as in the\nGym Challenge! You’re the great Champion,\r\nafter all. It’d be rude not to go all out!
The power of Grass has been wilted...\nYou’re quite the Champion!
Soon you’ll be the one to face down Gym\nChallengers aiming for your title.\r\nI can’t wait to see what talent grows!
I’m sure you remember, but I’m Nessa.\c\nAnd I’m not here to chat. I’m here to win!
I just don’t get it. What do I gotta do to beat\nyou, huh?
I have my best team, and we train and we train...\nBut then you’re always just one step ahead.\c\nMaybe that’s why I can’t stop thinking about you.
A tournament that ends when you lose!\nWhoever can keep up the heat will win!
[VAR 1101(00FD,0103)]A gGood Pokémon and a great Trainer! It’s no\nsurprise that you won!
I really enjoy battling you. It’s a great way for me\nto feel my own growth!\c\nAnd I plan to keep growing and battling, until I\nbecome an old coot that nobody can beat!
Focusing too much on winning can cause one to\nmake mistakes. I will face you with a clear head!
Your Pokémon... They’re so strong, they’re\npractically dizzying!
I want to achieve so many different things during\nbattles. It’s hard to decide sometimes...\r\nI still have much to learn.
...Let’s start the match.
I’m glad I had my mask...\nI was making quite the face just now...
...The only reason I can battle in front of so many\npeople without completely losing my cool is\r\nthanks to you, Champion.\c\nBattles with you are so absorbing that they simply\nmake me forget myself or where I am.
I’ve got nothing to say. I’m here to win.
I’ve been crushed! I pride myself on my solid\nPokémon, and yet this...
Sorry to lose my cool...\nI’ll be sure to challenge you again.
So what are your top 10 favorite Pokémon?\c\n...That’s just how I break the ice. Are you ready\nfor a Pokémon battle now?
I think you took breaking the ice a little\ntoo literally...
It helps inspire my Gym Trainers if I participate\nin this tournament from time to time!\c\nMy only choice is to keep aiming for that\ngrand victory!
I’ll get the audience pumped up, even without\nusin’ Dynamax!
That’s it?! Piers doesn’t do encores, but I admit\nI’m tempted right now!
Battlin’ you makes me wanna try out a new\nbattle style. Maybe a Pokémon battle and a\r\ngig combined. What do you think, huh?\c\nCould sound battles be a thing?
I’m going to defeat the Champion, win the whole\ntournament, and prove to the world just how\r\nstrong the great Raihan really is!
I look this good even when I lose. It’s a real\ncurse. Guess it’s time for another selfie!
Considering how many likes the photos of my\ndefeats to you get, I bet a victory photo would\r\njust explode!\c\nWait... Have I got my priorities mixed up?
If I want people to properly respect me as the\nnew Spikemuth Gym Leader, I need to show\r\njust how amazin’ I am by defeatin’ you!
I mean, if you’re gonna win, you could at least\nwin in a way that makes me look good, right?
I’ve been losin’ to you since the Gym\nChallenge, and I’m gettin’ a bit fed up!\c\nYou’d better battle me again!
It’s time to prove I’m a notch above the\ncompetition to everyone in the Galar region.\r\nThough I suppose everyone should know by now.
Why did I have the misfortune of being born in\nthe same time period as you...?
If it weren’t for you, then I could prove beyond\ndoubt that I am the best...\c\nStill, I do enjoy my battles with you...to a degree.
I didn’t do as well in the Gym Challenge as I’d\nhoped, but...this tournament is different!\r\nYou’ll see!
That was not what I wanted!\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no! NO!
I’m going to keep participating in this tournament\nuntil I’m satisfied! So you should keep coming,\r\ntoo, Champion!
I’m going to prove beyond doubt that Bug-type\nPokémon are strong and competitive!
Losing really bugs me!
I mean, there are different ways to be strong,\nright? I try not to let losing bring me down.\c\nPeople say I’ve got a tough spirit!
I’m going to soar to the highest point, just like\nthe Pokémon gracefully flying across the sky!
Oh no... Knocked down to the ground...
I’ll be flying again in no time!\nOnce I find a good air current...
My sponsor is here watching me today!\nI can’t have a pathetic battle!
Of all the days to lose, I lose today...
I get in trouble if I lose too much.\nThey say it damages the company’s brand.
Seeing you plow through the Gym Challenge was\na real inspiration for me...\r\nBut today, I came to win!
I think it’s always important to think about what\nyou can learn from your losses.
Thank you, Champion!\c\nI’ll use this experience to review how I battle\nand reevaluate my strategies.
I traveled all the way to the Kanto region to train\nmy karate!\c\nBehold the graceful moves of the Fighting Dojo!
My refined moves had no effect...\nYou’re just too amazing!
I’ve been told to start over every time I am\ndefeated, but to be honest I just wanted to\r\nbe with my Pokémon.
People think I’m edgy just because I love\nPoison-type Pokémon!
Losing doesn’t bother me, but I’m bummed that\nI couldn’t cover you in venom! Blaaah!
Poison can actually become medicine if it’s used\nproperly. Nothing edgy about it!
I prefer these tournaments over the Battle Tower.\nIt’s nice to have an audience!
Oh man, everyone just saw me get crushed...\nHow embarrassing!
I need to redeem myself! I’m gonna retrain my\nwhole team and make myself famous as a\r\nGhost-type user!
Even ice cannot be broken once it becomes\na glacier!
The strength I just showed you was only the tip\nof the iceberg!
I know, I know... If I can’t show it during matches,\nI can’t claim to have hidden strength.
I am grateful for this chance to defeat the\nChampion, even though the Gym Challenge\r\nis over!
Your Pokémon are so strong, it’s like I’m battling\nthe very land of the Galar region!
Now I know why I couldn’t beat you during the\nGym Challenge...\c\nBut I promise someday I will become strong—as\nstrong as the lands of Galar!
I’ll let the growth of plants overwhelm you!
Oh...\nI was overwhelmed.
Milo’s as stubborn as weeds, but...\nI still have a long way to go...
The Trainers of the Galar region need to give the\naudience a good show.\c\nThat means we need to show our strength!
Ele-shock! ...Huh? Oh, that means I’m shocked\nas an Electric-type user.
Even when I’m defeated, I try to give the match\nmy all and shock the audience in a good way!
I use powerful Dragon-type Pokémon.\nIf I’m not strong, then who is?
I couldn’t bring out the true strength of my\nDragon-type Pokémon...
I suppose a Trainer must be able to bring out the\ntrue potential of their Pokémon!
I’ve built my reputation by building up one win\nat a time. Think you can bring me down?
It only takes one defeat for everything I’ve built\nto come crashing down...
My pride was hard as steel too, but you really\npunched a hole through that.
So, I have a chance to battle the Champion?\nThis tournament’s a great deal!
Well, there goes the burning flame of\nmy ambition...
I guess all I got out of the tournament was a\nlesson on how strong the Champion is...
Don’t think I’m the same Milo as in the\nGym Challenge! You’re the great Champion,\r\nafter all. It’d be rude not to go all out!
The power of Grass has been wilted...\nYou’re quite the Champion!
Soon you’ll be the one to face down Gym\nChallengers aiming for your title.\r\nI can’t wait to see what talent grows!
Such strength! I’m in Psyshock!
Oh, my next Pokémon’s gonna make short work of—\nHuh? That was my last one?
That was everything I hoped for and more!
What a Psystrike to my poor pride...
Just what have you got that I don’t?
Oh, I could just Imprison myself for this!
But I didn’t hold back!\nI gave it everything I’ve got...
I have been swallowed whole by your\ngreat strength!
I did not get the chance to adapt!
Each one of your raindrops hit like a\nHydro Pump!
Your strength does not yield to cold or heat!
Light and dark aside, you have certainly\nbroadened my perspective!
Yes, even my strength perfected in light can be\novershadowed at times!
Now the darkness surrounds me... I am about\nto blackout!
It seems you have found your path and sailed right\non course!
You young folk grow so fast!\nIt never ceases to amaze me.
You young folk grow so fast!\nIt never ceases to amaze me.
Yeah I lost, but I’m gonna learn from your\nbattle style and everythin’!
Strength ebbs and flows in an endless cycle.\nOne moment you grasp it, and the next, it slips\r\nfrom your hand.\c\nBut the strength you now have—the strength that\nlet you defeat me—it is unwavering!\c\nCongratulations, from the bottom of my heart!

Gone and got stronger again, have you? Ah well!\nHats off to you—in more ways than one!

Looks like I’m down to one last Pokémon.\nI’ve been saving the best for last!
Flood the stadium and make it our ocean!\nDrednaw, time to Dynamax!
This is a little gift from us...\nI hope you can take it!
Woohoo! We’re not going to be done in that\neasy! We’re tough as weeds!
Come on, then! It’s Dynamax time! You’re about\nto be uprooted!
This’ll really leave you in shock and awe. It’s our\nDynamax move!
A Pokémon battle it is, then!\nI’ve got two partners with me!
Backed into a corner? You got it all wrong, mate!\nThis’ll just make my victory all the better!
Did you already know about type advantages?!
A critical hit?!\nWhat kind of beginner’s luck is that!
It’s not over yet!\nI’ve added another trusty ally to my team!
Have you gotten a bit stronger?\nMe and my team will put you to the test and see!
It’ll be a close one!\nBut that’s exactly my sort of match!
Well, look at you!\nSeems you’ve really learned your type matchups!
You landed a critical hit on my Pokémon?!\nYou’ve got plenty of spirit—that’s for sure!
Wha—? I made such a careless mistake?\nI’m supposed to be the greatest Trainer ever!
Have a taste of our true power!\nOur flames are burning bright!
Have a taste of our true power!\nThis wave is gonna crash right over you!
Have a taste of our true power!\nOur green power just keeps on growing stronger!
Keep up, mate! This is our chance to see if we\nare up to the Gym Challenge!
Landing a critical hit like that...\nYou’re pretty tough when you get serious!
Have a taste of our true power!\nOur flames are burning bright!
Have a taste of our true power!\nThis wave is gonna crash right over you!
Have a taste of our true power!\nOur green power just keeps on growing stronger!
Typical!\nShould’ve known you’d mastered type matchups!
Wha—? I made such a careless mistake?\nI’m supposed to be the greatest Trainer ever!
Let’s have a taste of what a Gym Badge holder’s\nteam can do!
Have a taste of our true power!\nOur flames are burning bright!
Have a taste of our true power!\nThis wave is gonna crash right over you!
Have a taste of our true power!\nOur green power just keeps on growing stronger!
Every one of my Pokémon is an ace!\nThis is no problem at all!
Typical!\nShould’ve known you’d mastered type matchups!
Landing a critical hit like that...\nYou’re pretty tough when you get serious!
I’ve learned loads from studying Lee’s battles!
Light that fire and get your mind moving, Kabu!\nThere still must be a path to victory!
Burn bright, Centiskorch. Let Gigantamax change\nyour size and your form!
Flames always burn upwards, and so we’ll always\naim to go higher. You understand, don’t you?
I’m counting on you, partner!
[~ 38]
[~ 39]
[~ 40]
Think you’ve got me cornered? Not even close!\nIt’ll be the greatest when I steal this win back!
Now that’s a proper move!
Steady on, partner!\nI feel your pain, and we’ll get them back for it!
[~ 44]
We’ve faced too much to quit now! We’ve got no\nchoice but to win!
We’ll show you a truly great pink. It’s time for my\ndear Hatterene to Gigantamax!
Tsk! What’s with that calm expression...\nThink you’re going to win?
I’ve got everyone’s cheers backin’ me!\nI’m really, really gonna win this time, got it?
My bro might not use it...\nBut I’ll Gigantamax my Pokémon if it’s to win!
I worked real hard trainin’ my favorite move,\njust so I could use it in a battle against you!
I’ve gotta win this if I’m gonna be the Champion!\nI’m comin’ at ya with everythin’ I’ve got!
All I’m after is victory, and I’m counting on you\nto help me grab it!
Have a taste of our true power!\nOur flames are burning bright!
Have a taste of our true power!\nThis wave is gonna crash right over you!
Have a taste of our true power!\nOur green power just keeps on growing stronger!
I don’t know what I can do to try to win now...\nbut all I can do is try! There’s nothing else for it!
Who wouldn’t aim for a supereffective hit if they\nhad the chance, right?
Ouch! Even I hurt when you manage to land a\ncritical hit like that one!
How’s that? Supereffective damage!\nI’m always looking for an opening!
It’s time to dig in our heels!\nI’m not giving up, so neither should you!
Argh! Fine then, let’s just destroy everything!\nYour skill is worthy of respect—and Gigantamaxing!
G-Max Chi Strike! I’ll use karate along\nwith my Pokémon’s move!
My very last Pokémon...\nHow lonely... How frightening...
Gengar... Gigantamax...\nSwallow everything in darkness...
G-Max Terror... It’s like Shadow Tag...\nYou won’t get away... I won’t let you!
Hmph. I’ve already seen more than enough to\njudge you and your team’s abilities.
I have to win this for the chairman! Do you really\nthink I’d let you keep me from everything I want?
My partner’s move is simply splendid, wouldn’t\nyou say?
You...\nDo you know my nickname?
The magic-user
The wizard
Bzzzt! Too bad.
Ding ding ding! Congratulations, you’re correct.
What is my favorite color?
Pink
Purple
That’s what I like to see in other people,\nbut it’s not what I like for myself.
Yes, a nice, deep purple...\nTruly grand, don’t you think?
All righty then... How old am I?
16 years old
88 years old
Hah!\nI like your answer!
Well, you’re not wrong. But you could’ve been a\nlittle more sensitive.
My morning tea is finally kicking in, and not a\nmoment too soon!
Are you prepared? I’m going to have some fun\nwith this.
You lack pink!\nHere, let us give you some.
All right! Time for me to test exactly how far I\ncan go with my latest and greatest team!
Have a taste of our true power!\nOur flames are burning bright!
Have a taste of our true power!\nThis wave is gonna crash right over you!
Have a taste of our true power!\nOur green power just keeps on growing stronger!
I’m the kind of guy who gets fired up to win in\nthese situations!
The way you battle...\nYou know, it kind of reminds me of Lee!
Considered the possibility your opponent might\nland a critical hit on your Pokémon, mate?
How’d you like that attack?!\nNow I really feel like we’re getting somewhere!
Not yet! I’m not crumbling to dust just yet.\nWe can still battle!
Like a giant mountain boulder!\nHiyah! Gigantamax!
Size means strength! Savor this pain!
Even if it cracks, ice is still ice! I’ll show you what\nI mean!
Come now—go on and Gigantamax. I’ll let you\nfreeze everything solid.
My partner’s signature move invites you to a\nsubzero world!
I’ve powered up a whole lot! I’m gonna beat you\nlot into the ground, got it?
As expected of my rival! You really know how to\nget me riled up!
Here’s a special move that I’ve been savin’ for\njust such an occasion!
Spikemuth initiation! Beatin’ down the challenger!
Everyone, cheer on my Pokémon! Let’s do it,\nScrafty! Intimidate the opponent!
Malamar’s gonna mess you all up with its\nContrary Ability!
Everyone’s gonna stink, but who cares! Go,\nSkuntank! Use your Sucker Punch and Toxic!
Time to meet another member of my crew!\nFace the proud, high roar of my Obstagoon!
I don’t do encores, get it? Not songs...\nNot moves... Not Pokémon!
Here’s a number I had saved just for this!\nYou lot in the stands better cheer me on!
[~ 111]
It might be impossible to pull off a combo going\nsolo, but it’s not impossible for me to still win!
Bring the storm!\nMy partner will send everyone in the stadium flying!
Let’s do it... Time for our G-Max Depletion!\nThe dragon’s roar will cut right through you!
Let the winds blow!\nStream forward, Sandstorm!
The winds rise again!\nStream forward, Sandstorm!
Ho?\nNot bad—changing the weather to Hail like that!
Pulling out a Sunny Day!\nHah! That’s not a bad countermeasure!
I’ll feel awful if I lose... But there’s no way\nI’m gonna!
It’d be no fun if things ended just yet...\nThat’s why we aren’t givin’ up!
Hmm, I think this move expresses my feelin’s.\nWhat do you think?
We battled back in the garden, but I’m really\nreally fired up for this match in the stadium!
Think you got me backed into a corner? No way!\nThis’ll just make my victory all the better!
Release all the thoughts poured into my\nWishing Star... Time for a Dynamax!
Have a taste of our true power!\nA burning crimson! Max Flare!
Have a taste of our true power!\nAn overflowing azure! Max Geyser!
Have a taste of our true power!\nA verdant emerald! Max Overgrowth!
I knew you’d be aiming for a supereffective hit!
How’s that?\nI learned a lot by studying Lee’s old matches!
All right, a crit!\nNow we’re really getting up to our full speed!
Steady on! Sure you’re not getting nervous with\nall the people watching?
My, how cheeky. To do such a thing as to hurt\nmy partner!
This is my last Pokémon?\nSeriously?! Oleana’s gotta finish this!
Here is a move I was good with even before I\nchanged my image.
I think I’ll treat you to something truly\nspectacular. A Gigantamax at Rose Tower.
I’m just giving your Pokémon a little chance to\nshine. That’s all.
Oh dear, what have I been doing? Well,\nwhatever. Let’s just get this over with.
This is a good time to test out a move I’ve been\ninterested in lately.
I learned this move from that old gran!\nI plan on making it my own!
It’s time to dig in our heels!\nI’m not giving up, so neither should you!
Argh! Fine then, let’s just destroy everything!\nIt’s time for an honorable Gigantamax!
G-Max Chi Strike! I’ll use karate along\nwith my Pokémon’s move!
You might have one win on me, but this is where\nI show you what I can really do when I’m serious!
My very last Pokémon...\nHow lonely... How frightening...
Gengar... Gigantamax...\nSwallow everything in darkness...
G-Max Terror... It’s like Shadow Tag...\nYou won’t get away... I won’t let you!
Everyone’s looking...\nI want to hide...but I’ll fight!
Looks like I’m down to one last Pokémon.\nI’ve been saving the best for last!
Flood the stadium and make it our ocean!\nDrednaw, time to Gigantamax!
This is a little gift from us...\nI hope you can take it!
Sonia might be disappointed, but I’m going to\nwash your team away!
That’s Drought!\nIt gets the sunlight burning real harsh!
Bring the storm!\nMy partner will send everyone in the stadium flying!
You do realize I’m the great Raihan, right?\nI’ll be the one to beat Leon. So first I’ll beat you!
Let’s do it... The dragon roars!\nTime for my ultimate attack—G-Max Depletion!
Let the winds blow!\nStream forward, Sandstorm!
Here comes the rain!\nFeel its cold dampness soak into your body!
Ho?\nNot bad—changing the weather to Hail like that!
Here you go! Have a taste of Sunny Day!\nHave you got a plan to counter it?
[~ 160]
[~ 161]
You’re pretty tough... Yes, entirely too tough.\nDon’t you think that’s unfair?
Oh, oh? Down to my last Pokémon...\nHmm, this isn’t looking too good...
All right, then... Hopefully, this move will turn\nthings around for me.
I’ll show you a move that’ll hit so hard, you’ll\nbe speechless!
It’s one of the duties of the Champion to get the\ncrowd fired up!
It’s a champion time to turn up the heat!\nCharizard, time for our G-Max Wildfire!
I’m not finished having a champion time here!\nAnd I won’t let anyone else finish it for me!
A supereffective hit...\nI’d expect nothing less from your team!
Aiming for supereffective hits is a surefire way\nto claim victory!
A critical hit...\nHah! Pretty good, Challenger!
Don’t get caught up on a critical hit.\nFocus on what you’re going to do next!
I’ll show you what Charizard can really do!\nIt’s Gigantamax time!
Hey, looks like we can use our moves now!\nThanks to Zacian and Zamazenta, that is!
This is it! Hurry, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nTry to catch Eternatus NOW!

Wha—?! The move had no effect on it?!
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! I can’t see anything! You OK?!
I can’t see anything!
Uwaaaaaah!
The mysterious Pokémon’s gaze is fixed on you...
The mysterious Pokémon’s gaze is fixed on you...
This is the way a real Champion catches Pokémon!
Out you go, Rookidee!
You encountered a wild Wooloo!
Gotcha!\nWooloo was caught!
Wow... It’s huge!\nLet’s take it on together, [VAR 0100(0000)]!
What? I can’t use any moves!
I forgot! We found the sword and shield in the\nSlumbering Weald!
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], use that sword! It might be old\nand rusted, but there’s got to be some use to it!
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], use that shield! It might be old\nand rusted, but there’s got to be some use to it!
I got it!
Leave it to me!
Hmph! That’s enough faffing about. I suppose it’s\ntime to get serious.
Tch. No more warm ups. It’s time to beat\nyou hollow!
I understand you want to get it over with and\nlose, but why don’t we enjoy this a little longer!
I know you’re in a hurry to lose, but we should\nenjoy this for a while longer!
Let’s do it, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nDon’t hold anything back!
My goal was always to surpass Lee, but he’s not\nthe Champion anymore.
I’m not sure what my goal is now.
[~ 240]
[~ 241]
You and Sonia followed your own paths...
I was the only one left behind and trying to\ncatch up!
[~ 244]
But then I went around saving Pokémon\nalongside you and Piers...
And I realized that I could help other people!
[~ 247]
[~ 248]
Blast! You really got me with that one.\nBut battling you sure is fun, [VAR 0100(0000)]!
[~ 250]
I want to see which of us comes out the victor,\nand yet I also don’t ever want this battle to end...
That’s the kind of strange feeling I’m having!\nYou feel it, too, don’t you, [VAR 0100(0000)]?
[~ 253]
[~ 254]
[~ 255]
Yeah!
Not really...
I knew you must! It’s kind of embarrassing,\nbut I’m glad it’s not just me!
What? It’s embarrassing if I’m the only one who’s\nso into this!
Right then! Laugh or cry all you want, but this is it!\nThis is the end!
[~ 261]
My days as a Gym Leader have made me\nstronger than you.
You just might be the strongest Champion in\nGalarian history.
That’s right!
I’ve still got a ways to go!
I’ll carve my name into Galar’s history, too.\nBy defeating you!
I’ll make sure to draw out every last bit of\nstrength from you...and then triumph!
Hmph. Looks like you’ve grown a bit.\nOnly a little bit, though!
Excellent!\nNot everyone can corner my team like this!
It’s not every day I get to battle you, so I\nsuppose I may as well try out this move.
My cheers will really get you goin’!
Thanks!
Thanks for the help!
Feel that flow! Yeah! You feelin’ it,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?
Yeah!
Let’s go!
Yeah! Have some of my support! I know you can\nkeep the beat goin’!
You’re the best, Marnie!
Dance, Pokémon!
Zacian has an intense look in its eyes.
Zamazenta has an intense look in its eyes.
Remember, it’s just a test—so take it easy! I’ll be\nnice and gentle...as I knock you out flat!
How am I the one getting backed into a corner?\nThis should NOT be a thing!
Hah! That’s right! Let my poison drive\nyou Kla-razy!
Oopsie! Guess my move was super effective. Get\nready, ’cause there’s more where that came from!
Look, the first damage you took on the Isle of\nArmor! Consider it a little gift from me!
Heh. I’ll show you what true power looks like.
Wh-when did I get beat down to my last\nPokémon?! Did you use Hypnosis on me?
Prepare to experience psychic powers that defy\nhuman comprehension!
That’s the power of type matchups. Truly, this\nshall be an elegant battle!
Heh. I’ve dealt the first damage you’ve taken on\nthis island.
Yippee! Oh, I just can’t wait to see you battle\nyour heart out!
Ohoho! Looks like my little old self’s been\ncornered. I’m getting the shivers!
Oof, super-duper effective!\nUh-oh, I smell danger!
Yeeek! When luck favors you like that, it’s a\nsure sign you’re a good Trainer!
Let’s set the record straight right here. I’ll show\nyou once and for all that I’m the better Trainer!
Am I really gonna lose again? Is there just...\nsomething wrong with me?
Go on! Get ’em! Knock ’em flat! And give ’em a\nlittle venom for good measure!
Oh fine, hit us with our weakness!\nWhat’re you, a supereffective move machine?!
Hmph! Enjoy your dumb luck while it lasts, ’cause\nit ain’t gonna happen again!
Oooh look at that! My attack worked just great.\nNow get ready for another dose!
I think it’s about time we found out...which of us\nis truly superior!
I am not weak! I cannot lose!
I’ll have you dancing in the palm of my hand!\nThis is my most powerful, elegant Psychic move!
H-how cheeky. Let’s agree that move is banned\nfrom now on, yes?
The fates have truly abandoned me. I am\nbut a poor little lost Wooloo.
Before my psychic powers, all your weaknesses\nare laid bare!
I’m not holding a single thing back anymore.\nTime to settle this—fair and square!
Oh, and maybe watch your step... Looks like some\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Toxic Spikes[VAR FF00(0000)] somehow got on the Battle Court!
There’s no way I’m losing! I ain’t letting go till\nthe bitter end!
Watch out, audience! One dose of Klara poison\nand there’s no turning back!
They say the dose makes the poison, so have\nseconds! Here’s a full-course feast of venom!
Sorry, my dear Pokémon! I should’ve given better\ndirections. But hang in there! You’ve got this!
Hmph! Well, look who’s just a type-matchup\nmaster. Ain’t that nice for you!
Ah-HA! That’s right! Let my poison drive\nyou Kla-razy!
Heh. Let us have an elegant battle worthy of\nbeing called a finale.
Prepare to sink into despair...and into the\n[VAR FF00(0006)]weird battlefield[VAR FF00(0000)] beneath your feet!
We shall awaken our true psychic power here\nand now!
With a one, two, three...this Poké Ball will\ngrow gigantic!
My unbelievable psychic powers will utterly\nhumiliate you!
Ah! Are you all right, my elegant Pokémon?
The move had no effect?! Such an injustice.\nI’m so steamed, my glasses are fogging up!
Heh, a supereffective hit! That was an elegant move\nchoice on my part, wouldn’t you agree?
I’ll need to get serious if I am to take you on!
Hone your senses now...and let this battle\nsharpen you! Show me how you can grow!
Watch closely, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nThis is what Kubfu’s fists are truly capable of!
Oho! Stings to let a critical hit slip on through,\ndoesn’t it?
It’s been a while since I faced such a strong\nopponent... My blood’s boiling over!
Time to see exactly what all this training has\nmade of you!
My skills are only getting sharper!\nTry not to get captivated by my might!
Now, become the gigantic fist that breaks your\nopponent—as one would smash through a board!
Let’s see if you can withstand this move!\nShow me what you’re made of!
Aha! I see you’ve got your fundamentals\ndown pat. But that alone won’t cut it!
Brought luck over to your side, have you?\nThat makes you all the more enticing an opponent!
Let that be a reminder—a single slip could cost\nyou everything!
Fuhaha! Seems like victory smiles on me today!
All right now, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nLet’s have some fun...and I’ll try not to hurt you!
Ahh, the tension that comes when it’s down to\nthe wire! This is where it gets fun!
Time to play our ace in the hole! Turn gigantic,\nmy dear Venusaur!
You’d better brace yourself for this... Think of it\nas a little tough love!
Time to play our ace in the hole! Turn gigantic,\nmy dear Blastoise!
Try not to get washed away in this deluge, all\nright, love?
Gahaha! Aren’t you the brave one, pickin’ a fight\nwith a onetime Gym Leader!
Steel’s tough as they come! The more hits it\ntakes, the more ultra-mega-determined it gets!
Time for the tough to get goin’!\nLet loose, Aggron!
Not bad! Not bad at all!\nBut watch out—next time, it’s my turn!
Brrriiice!
Glastrier is after your Iceroot Carrot!
Sheighhhhd!
Spectrier is after your Shaderoot Carrot!
Cro rown!
Ro crow own!
It seems this calls for my true psychic powers.\nI daresay victory will change hands this time!
Behold my psychic power’s maddening potency...\nI’m afraid this move will put you in checkmate!
I command you to grow enormous, my\nelegant Pokémon!
This battle ain’t over yet!\nMy heart’s unbreakable, you hear?!
They say one person’s poison is another person’s\ntonic... But Klara’s poison is super potent!
Keep your eyes peeled, everyone!\nIt’s time for Klara’s big moment!
The toughest opponents only make us stronger!\nTime to turn this battle around!
I won’t go easy on you, so do your best to\nsurvive! Brace yourself!
Let your colossal fists shatter any wall that stands\nin your way!
For steel, toughness is everythin’!\nA little pressure won’t make me lose heart!
Get ready for an ultra-mega-impact!\nHere comes a massive one!
Feels like time for a dose of you-know-what!\nGet ready to see some REAL bulk!
You lot are so strong, I’ve got to doff my cap...\nBut this isn’t over yet!
Let’s see how hot your passion burns!\nGo, Charizard! G-Max Wildfire!
Get ready—here comes the climax!\nIt’s Gigantamax time!
*sigh*... You think you can win, don’t you?\nI suppose I should correct such wishful thinking!
If you think you can avoid this, go ahead and try!\nCrush them with G-Max Smite!
Let’s blot them out with our color, Hatterene!\nTime to Gigantamax!
I ain’t goin’ down that easy!\nI got skin in this game too, y’know!
I’m real proud of how well I’ve honed this move!\nGet ready to get sent packin’!
All right, Grimmsnarl! Make my wishes come\ntrue...and Gigantamax!
Time to dig my heels in for my friends!\nJust need to grow until we can reach victory!
My moves are grown with care in my garden!\nDon’t let yourselves get knocked flat!
Grow big and strong—Gigantamax!\nTime to harvest victory!
Even my last drop is enough to submerge you!
How long do you think you can stay dry up\nagainst our tidal might?
Get ready to be marooned in the widest of seas!\nDrednaw—time to Gigantamax!
Come on, Kabu—you can still win!\nBurn a path through to victory!
The only place I’m going is to the top!\nI’ll blaze my way through each battle!
Let your flames scorch all of Galar!\nI believe in you, Centiskorch!
I’ve got one last number for ya!\nGet ready to etch it into your ears and hearts!
Watch me strum out one wicked move!\nGet ready—I’m turnin’ it up to eleven!
All right, Raihan! Time to win this and become\nthe true Galarian star you were born to be!
Ring out, dragon’s roar!\nLet them feel it in their bones!
Stand tall, Duraludon!\nSmash their hopes of winning to pieces!
You’d better concentrate!\nIf you make the smallest slip, I’ll pounce on it!
Put your hips into it when you punch!\nThen take that fist and seize us our victory!
Time to go on the offensive! We’ll change the\ncourse of this battle with one hit!
All it takes is one pitfall to defeat you.\nHow shall I start digging...?
Rise up, G-Max Volcalith!\nCan you escape from the prison of stone?
You’re unbreakable, Coalossal!\nI’ve got absolute faith in you!
Good-byes are so sad...\nP-please...stay with me...
I want to keep my whole team together...\nI’ll never...let any of them go!
C-creep out of the shadows, Gengar.\nShow them all your reproach...
The final freeze is the deepest!\nGet ready to shiver down to your bones!
Now watch how your partner Melony uses her\nice, and feel the chill creep in!
Looks like an ice age is looming...\nHow many minutes do you think you’ll last?
M[VAR 1100(00FF,0205)]asters. [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nHow do you like this? I’ve...I’ve nothing left!
Now, let loose a move so dignified it\ndefies description!
Only a true celebrity could retain this great poise\nin this great peril!
Feel free to gaze in wonderment at this move—\nas noble as it is damaging!
You’ve got us up against the wall, mate, but\nyou’re about to see what we’re really made of!
See if you can keep up with this beat!\nRillaboom, use G-Max Drum Solo!
I’ve got some massive dreams, and the only thing\nbig enough to hold ’em is Gigantamaxing!
Burn ’em up, Cinderace!\nShow us a G-Max Fireball!
Wash ’em all away, Inteleon!\nUse G-Max Hydrosnipe!
Well now, that move certainly woke me up.\nIt’d be rude not to return the favor!
There’s more to strength than just physical power.\nNow, let’s sap some of that vitality!
Keeping things simple is just boring.\nHave a taste of this refined flavor!

Master! I’ll never give up on the dojo!\nMy psychic power will end things here and now!
Fuhaha! Now that’s what I like to hear.\nIn that case, let’s do this elegantly!
Behold our elegance...even when one of us dared\nturn his back on the Psychic type!
*tsk*... Those floating balls are so distracting.\nStill, we’re going to win!
Well, if I must share the pitch with a Dark-type\nTrainer...at least we’re on the same side.
A pair of newly minted Gym Leaders like us can\ntake on anyone—even the Champion!
Hee hee! C’mon, Bede!\nLet’s poison them, nice and proper!
You’re a little disquieting, you know...\nJust try not to get in my way.
All eyes on me, Master! I’ll show you that I’m\ncute AND strong!
This should be fun! But I don’t plan on letting you\nsteal the spotlight for strength or adorableness!
Team Supercute with Klara and Marnie!\nEveryone’s gonna be head over heels for us!
I-I’unno about cute or anythin’...\nBut sendin’ ’em head over heels works for me!
Take it easy on those brittle bones, old bloke!\nThe Peony train won’t stop for any bellyachin’!
Watch your mouth, youngster!\nTry not to get knocked out too soon!
Master Mustard!\nIt’s an honor to battle at your side!
Not to copy you, my boy, but with two former\nChampions...it’ll be a doubly champion time!
Right then, Leon lad!\nLet’s put ’em down nice and quick!
I’m looking forward to fighting alongside\nSteel Peony himself!
All right, Kabu! Let’s show ’em what us edgy\nolder blokes are made of!
Not a bad idea! Say, if we win, why don’t you\ncome back to the League?
Now then, my bed-headed partner!\nLet us comport ourselves as celebrities would!
What?! This isn’t bed head!\nThat nonsense on your head is worse, anyway!
Like there’s any way us two together could lose!\nGot yer spikes all tuned up?
You bet! C’mon, Bro—let’s show ’em we’re even\nfiercer together!
Would you like a cheer from my noble self, miss\nDark-type Trainer with your boldly cut hair?
L-lay off! I don’t need your cheerin’!\nLet’s just focus on the battle!
Your water’s got my Pokémon all energized and\nhappy, Nessa!
I’ll extinguish any flame that so much as casts\na spark at your greenery!
Water and rock can douse flame, but my\nPokémon can absorb them both!
I’m counting on you, Milo!\nLet’s show everyone what this team can do!
My Grass-type Pokémon have got your back,\nPiers! We’ll make sure you have center stage!
Aw, quit embarrassin’ me, Milo!\nYou’ll have to Dynamax for the pair of us!
Hello there, Allister! No need to get nervous.\nLet’s battle at our own pace!
Th-thanks, Milo...\nI...appreciate it...
We’ll burn away any plants that try to wring you\ndry, Nessa!
Great! And let us wash away any stone or earth\nthat tries to quench your flames!
I look forward to learning from the ever-shifting\nnature of your Water-type moves!
In serious mode like always, aren’t you?\nLet’s go have a nice dessert once we’ve won!
Water helps push rocks forward...\nThe opponent doesn’t stand a chance!
I never get tired of seeing those backward\nsomersaults of yours, Gordie...
Dark and Dragon, scales and shade! ♪\nFairy types get us both afraid! ♪
You just keep on singing, Piers!\nI’ll dish out all the damage we need!
All right, Raihan! Use those weather tricks and\nmake it rain cheers in this stadium!
Way ahead of you, Leon! Though I’m already\nlooking forward to taking YOU on!
Remember our plan, Raihan!\nI’m counting on you to get that weather going!
No hard feelings if the plan slips my mind!\nYou know I run wild in battle!
Hello there, Raihan! I look forward to battling\nalongside such a mighty Gym Leader!
I know I’m in for a rough time with you, Melony!\nYou’re tough on teammates and opponents alike!
Let’s use our rock-solid moves to crush the\nwillpower of any opponent!
That’s an encouraging sentiment.\nLet’s take the fight to them, Gordie.
Let us put up a fight worthy of showing to\nM[VAR 1100(00FF,0205)]asters. [VAR 0100(0000)]!
It goes without saying, Older Brother!\nSuch is our noble duty!
[~ 469]
[~ 470]
Don’t mind me, child. You got all the correct\nanswers to my quizzes, so do as you please.
I’ll still back you up the best I can to take some\nweight off your shoulders, Ms. Opal!
Come now, Bede...\nTime for our Double Pink Typhoon!
I don’t think that’s a move, Ms. Opal...\nNo matter—I’m sure we’ll win!
What better team-up to make our opponents\nshiver than Ice and Ghost types?
R-right you are!\nW-we’ll send chills up their spines...
Come on, Hop! Our bond as brothers is way\nstronger than any Champion!
I know [VAR 0100(0000)] better than anybody.\nYou just leave h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer to me!
Remember our Gym Challenge? I’m gonna let\nloose all the frustration I’ve been holdin’ in since!
Watch yourself, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nYour old rivals are teaming up to take you down!
Now, I haven’t battled at your side for quite a\nlong while. It’s almost a little embarrassing!
Fuhahaha! We’re still too young to be reminiscing\nabout the good old days, Opal!
Do your best, young Piers.\nOr I’ll...Play Rough.
Yeah, I’ve gotta pass on that. I don’t think I\ncould handle havin’ an 88-year-old Play Rough.
What say we give this stadium a nice cooling off,\nNessa, dear?
Gladly! Let’s dazzle the whole place with our\nglimmering teamwork!
I’m truly honored to get to battle alongside such\na legendary Champion.
Come now, don’t be shy! Stand tall!\nLet us enjoy the clashing of fists together!
I-I-I’ll...do my best!
Don’t be so nervous, boy!\nI’m looking forward to seeing how you battle!
I trust you to bring us a silvery-white victory,\nLady Melony!
Oh, you’ll embarrass me with that “Lady” talk.\nAnyway, I’ll leave the Fighting types to you!
Aaah! Ohmygosh, Gordie! You’re super popular!\nI can’t believe we’re on the same team!
Um, do be careful. A lot of my fans can get a\nlittle wild sometimes...
Battling gifted opponents gets my heart beating,\nno matter how many times I do it!
Let’s hurry and get this started! Time to see who\ncan win some Exp. Points off the other!
I’m really up against the wall now...which will\nmake winning all the more satisfying!
Flex your gigantic muscles, Urshifu! Let your\nmighty frame burst through the sky itself!
Every one of the thousands of times we’ve\nswung our fists was for the sake of this moment!
Hmm, yes! I feel an unyielding power emanating\nfrom that Pokémon and that move!
Now, was that pinpoint aim or plain luck? Either\nway...it made things interesting!
A little lapse in judgment, eh? How unlike you!
A fine stroke of luck...but I know you won’t be\nworn out as easily as that!
I’m still working on getting stronger! So don’t go\nlaughing if I don’t do well!
Still not pulling any punches, I see. Not that I\ncare or anything!
All righty, Slowbro! Time to dream bigger—\nand be bigger!
Your Pokémon will look sooo much cuter once I\ngive it a nice coat of venom!
You’ll have to do more than that to make me\nlose heart! I’m gettin’ better every day!
Gah! Seriously? It didn’t work? I hate this...but I\nshould’ve expected as much.
Tee hee! That’s me—as cute as I am\nclever with moves!
I’ll send your head spinning just like this\nPoké Ball!
My power only grows when my back’s to the wall.\nYou’ve no one to blame for this but yourself!
With a one, two, three...my Pokémon will be\ngigantic! And with nothing up my sleeves, either!
Witness my ESP! Which, of course, stands for\nElegant Spectacular Power!
S-super effective? Your Nature certainly isn’t\nCalm, is it?
M-my glasses were foggy! That’s it! I couldn’t\nsee anything—that’s why that happened!
No amount of training can hide one’s\nweaknesses... That goes for you, too!
All right, let’s give it a go! Watch out, I’m going\nto get serious!
You’re doing just splendidly, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nThis is exactly what makes you our rising star!
All right, my dear Venusaur! Bloom so fully your\npetals cover the whole island!
Sorry if this stings a bit. That’s just how tough\nlove works!
All right, my dear Blastoise, get ready to give\na soaking! Show us that big, splendid shell!
Sorry if you get a bit soggy. I’ll lend you a towel\nwhen we’re through here!
My dear Nia’s watchin’ from the sidelines!\nTime to activate coolest-dad-ever mode!
Don’t go lettin’ your guard down yet!\nI’ve still got a thrashin’ left to give!
That was one heavy blow!\nHope you felt a nice, big thump!
Look at you showin’ how it’s done!\nI expected nothin’ less from you, Chief!

Doesn’t matter if we win or lose...\nLet’s just have fun!
I might be young, but I hope you won’t hold that\nagainst me.
I’m not like all the rest of those youngsters\nyou might’ve battled till now!
Deep breath in, and...deep breath out...\nNo, wait—I’m still not ready for this!
I’m gonna do this! I’m gonna take you on!\nI’m gonna hold nothing back!
Well, look at you...\nI think I could go all out if it were against you.
Watch as I show you what my studies have\ntaught me!
I’m the president of my school’s Pokémon club!
If I keep making my opponent’s Pokémon flinch,\nthen it’s like my turn never ever ends!
Crumbs, y-you look strong...\nI’m not sure I’m up for this...
Oh my word, it’s been AGES since I last saw you!\nHow’ve you been doing?!
Let’s battle to decide which one of us has\nthe cutest Pokémon!
Pika pika?
I can relax the best when I’m dressed up like\na Pikachu.
Guess what! Guess what!\nFolks are always telling me my team’s real strong!
I’m going to use my Veevee power to make you\ncry wee, wee, wee all the way home!
I was out playing, and I ended up wandering in\nhere by mistake!
I’m here in my jam jams!\nGuess I’ll battle in jam jams!
I don’t go easy on anyone. Not even on children.
I’ve just popped over for a battle during my\nbreak time, so let’s make this quick!
Here, let me give you my card...\nWhat, you don’t have a business card?
I take all the stress I’ve built up in my workplace\nand blast it all away with a good battle!
Time to leverage my core competencies!\nI’ve got buy-in from all my Pokémon!
I wish I could get paid just for battling Pokémon...
You’re the Champion, aren’t you?!\nC-could I get your autograph?
My shorts are from Jetsetter.\nIt’s a famous brand, I’ll have you know.
Show my Pokémon a bit of love, won’t you?
Ah... That’s it! I’ve decided! If I win this match,\nI’m going to tell my crush exactly how I feel!
Statistically speaking, the odds are 95 percent\ncertain that I’ll win!
Do your best in this battle!\n’Cause I’m live streaming it all, see!
... ... ...\nYou gonna start this or what?
If I’m good at Pokémon battles, I’ll be popular!
It’s not just a costume!\nI really am a Pokémon!
Nice to meetcha, pika!\nWant a battle, pika pika?
Pokémon with Hidden Abilities are hard to find\nin the wild, but guess who got lucky?
Your Pokémon shall be my Pokémon’s playthings!
If I had to rank my strength, I’d say it’s...\nat the lower end of average.
I don’t get enough exercise in my daily life,\nso I’m here to do some Pokémon battling!
Let’s make this a real flashy battle worth posting\non all my feeds, OK?
Want to know what kind of work I do around\nthe office?
Pokémon Breeders have to be early risers!
Pokémon that are hatched from Eggs may know\nunusual moves!
It’s love that makes me raise them...\nAnd love that makes me battle with them.
All right there?\nI’m a new Breeder! Charmed, I’m sure!
Safety first!\nThen Poké Ball second!
Have you been enjoying riding on the trains that\nI bust my butt to maintain?!
When it comes to battle, my Pokémon have got\nthe heart to take part! Have you?!
I’ve got a doctor’s note. I can’t be expected to\nlift anything heavier than a Poké Ball...
You...you smell strong to me.\nOr at least like you haven’t showered in a while.
I’ve been training myself up through an online\nkarate class! Hiyah!
I’ve been living alone up in the mountains and\ntraining my Pokémon without distraction!
You can see it, can’t you?\nHow positively cut my six-pack is?
Huh? What’s going on?\nAre we supposed to battle now or something?
The people in Galar are all so nice!\nAre you?
I’m off duty today, mate. I’ll not be hearing any\nof that “the customer is always right” rubbish!
Where to, guv?
The true heart of fishing is being able to wait!\nAnd wait...and wait...and wait...
Fancy a spot of fishing?\nI love me a good bit of fishing.
Hrmmm?! You look right suspicious to me!\nI think I’ll have to take you in for questioning!
I’m not skiving off work—I swear it!\nThis tower is a part of my regular patrol beat!
I’m the living proof that there’s no reason you\ncan’t be both beautiful and strong! Watch this!
I’m a star on and off the runway.\nNow see how I shine.
How about a double shot...\nof defeat?!
I bring richness and depth to everything I do,\nwhether its brewing a drink or battling Pokémon!
I come from one of the great noble houses of\nthe Galar region.
I am here to evaluate the quality of your team,\nboth in terms of strength and appearance.
My Pokémon are as strong as anything!\nWe’re gonna show you, you young thing!
All right! I’m up for a battle with you!\nLet’s get this place...ROCKING!
The Pokémon are the lead performers!\nI’m just a backup dancer!
Let’s dance!
It’s pretty tough going once you reach this level.\nNot many make it higher than this.
No WAY! You’re the Champion! Get out!!\nThis is, like, the greatest day of my life!
I’m here taking part in the Battle Tower together\nwith my girlfriend!
I’m here taking part in the Battle Tower together\nwith my boyfriend!
I might look like a Pokémon, but don’t you dare\nhit me with any of your moves!
Kneel down before me!
They said I had to come battle here as part of my\nnew-hire orientation, that’s all...
I AM A ROBOT IN HUMAN APPEARANCE.\nI WILL DEEPEN MY TIES WITH POKÉMON.
Are you raising your Pokémon?\nOr are you not?
My babies are all frightfully cute!
Feast your eyes on the muscles I’ve developed\ndoing years of hard construction labor!
All right, pack it in!\nLet’s get this battle over and done with!
I joined up as part of the League staff because\nI heard I’d be popular that way!
People say I seem harsh, but I’m really very nice!
Let’s begin the operation...\nScalpel, please.
What’s this?\nYou’d like me to examine your Pokémon?
Battle is like art in so many ways!\nBut art is completely different than battle!
Hehe! Well, aren’t you a cute little thing I get\nto take on in battle! ♪
I shall show you how a true gentleman battles.
Well, have a look at you! You are the spitting\nimage of my grandchildren, dear.
Student and Trainer!\nI’ve got many hats to wear, all right?!
I never fit in with the others at school.\nThis is the only place I really belong!
No one in my class offers me any challenge.\nI wonder if you’ll be any different?
Don’t you dare think I’ll be an easy pushover just\nbecause I’m still a child!
I’m gonna come at you like whoa, then bam,\nand you’re gonna totally be like “whaaat!”
Battling and winning...\nTell me—what does it all mean?
When I grow up, my dream is to be Champion!
I’ve waited 20 years for this day to come!
It’s important you don’t neglect all the routine\ntasks, whether it’s for work or training Pokémon.
I got off at the wrong stop on the monorail and\nsomehow ended up at the Battle Tower.
Eek!\nY-you weren’t watching me just now, right?!
I won’t raise any Pokémon that don’t have\nadorable backsides to watch in battle!
Hm? I think I’ve seen you at the station.
Mind the gap between yourself and victory.\nMind the gap.
It’s mighty strange, but for some reason, folk oft\nseem to feel poorly after eating my cooking.
Pokémon that have been carefully seasoned\nwith the perfect amount of training... Masterful!
I’m a wandering day laborer. I go where my heart\nleads, then dig, dig, dig till I can’t dig no more.
Hope you’re ready for some hard hits!\nThe right moves take weight into consideration!
I’d meant to become a flower arranger,\nbut I ended up as a boilermaker!
My helmet’s as durable as my Pokémon!
I’m going to hit your Pokémon right where it\nhurts! This’ll be a critical battle!
I’m sleepy... This is such a pain...\nI didn’t sleep but two hours last night!
When you do this job long enough, you develop\na knack for telling who’s strong at a glance.
Truth is, I’d rather just be at home, relaxing\nand vegging out with my Pokémon...
“A Serious Battle”—scene one, take one!\nThree, two, one, and...action!
I’m gonna film you so up close and personal,\nyour pores are gonna be famous!
Hah...hah... I...I battled all the way here just\nto get an exclusive interview with you!
I’m live on the scene here at the Battle Tower!\nWhat a sight! You getting this back in the studio?
I’ve heard that Pokémon battling can be a pretty\ngood workout.
Join the legions of my fans!
They call me the connoisseur of moves!
I often see you coming round to the Pokémon\nCenter for a bit of care.
Here I am out on my journey, and I meet you!
Don’t blow my cover! I’m part of the International\nPolice, here on a lead about a certain case!
You’re coming to my gig tonight, right?\nYou’ll buy tickets, right?
People always seemed shocked to find out I’m an\nopera singer. Guess it must be my face...
There’s one thing you really need for battle...\nA killer sense of rhythm!
It’s been three years since I left home to become\na star! I’m not going back till I’ve made it!
You look like a strong one!\nEver thought of joining the force?
I was a real bad seed when I was young.\nEverybody feared me in the neighborhood.
Can we get this over with?\nI’m due for a yoga class soon!
I nip my competition in the bud before it has the\nchance to grow. That’s how I’ve made it this far.
B-blimey but I’m nervous...\nPlease be kind!
My shorts are the perfect fit!\nThat means I can’t lose!
I’ve got a test tomorrow that I should be revising\nfor, but I came for a battle instead!
Can you hear me? I’m talking directly to your\nmind right now.
Postal delivery! I’ve got a parcel here with your\nname on it. Oh, look. The contents say “defeat.”
I’ll walk all over you with the well-developed\ncalves I got from years of making deliveries!
When I wear a surgical mask, it makes my glasses\nfog up!
Steady on. You don’t look very well.\nI think what you need is a jab.
People call me “the angel in the white coat.”\nJust thought I’d mention it.
RKS Laboratories is like a home to me.\nI work such long hours, I rarely see my real one...
I’ve got you covered. Just say the place,\nand I’ll have you there in a heartbeat.
My top priority is your safety and comfort.\nWhich is why I expect you’ll pay extra, eh?
Body temperature and weight are both right\non track! These Pokémon are in top condition!
Oh-ho? Now this is a promising specimen!\nI’d definitely like to see more!
Come on! No grumbling accepted here.\nLet’s let our Pokémon do the talking!
What would you say your training style is?\nGenerous and openhanded? Or maybe spartan?
I’ve grown so weary of all the world’s pleasures.\nNow all I do from dawn to dusk is battle wildly.
Why don’t I give you the chance to see the\nPokémon I’ve spent a fortune raising!
My children have all grown and left home.\nNow I’m embarking on a new life of my own!
I heard the other ladies at the club saying that\nPokémon were quite the thing, so here I am.
Heh! If you want to know what moves my\nPokémon use, you’re about to learn firsthand!
*scritch scritch scritch* Wood carving...\n*scritch scritch scritch* It’s so zen...
After years and years of training, I’ve finally\nmanaged to obtain the ultimate moves!
Wot’s this? You my next victim?
Be a good sport.\nLet’s have a fair-and-square battle.
Being able to read a Pokémon’s mind...\nThat’s the real trick to fishing.
I’m in the market for a fishing buddy!\nHow about you? Care to go fish with me?
Life’s got its mountains and its valleys.\nJust like this tower’s got its highs and lows!
I love climbing up to the top, and I love\ntumbling down to the bottom, too!
I’ve filled myself with the great power of\nboundless nature!
All right, there? You strong or what?\nI’m gonna expect a good battle, yeah?
I-if I win, would you help me get a hotel room\nfor tonight? I’m so tired of camping...
The battle’s not over until it’s over.\nDon’t let your focus slip!
Winning and losing aren’t as important to me\nas having a right good time!
I battled and battled and battled...\nAll to be standing right here!
Hahaha! Think you can show me a fun time?
I’ve left behind my family, my friends—everything.\nThe only thing for me is this—the battlefield.
Think you can keep up with the spweed at which\nI ewolve and change?
Our department takes a real hard-line stance.\nNo lenience for juveniles!
My boyfriend broke my heart...\nNow I’m ready to break yours!
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! I’ve been waiting for you.\nAlways knew you’d be able to win your way here.\c\nNow, how about you take on Challenger Leon\nwith everything that you’ve got?
Well done, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nJust as I knew you’d do!\c\nI never expected the Poké Ball Tier would hold\nyou long...\c\nNow it’s time you and I had some fun!
The Battle Tower is the place to go if you want to\nsee how Trainers dedicated to growing stronger\r\nlive and do battle.\c\nLooks as though your own strength is about as\namazing as ever, [VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nBut I’ll not just take your word for it!
My dream has always been to make the people\nof the Galar region stronger.\c\nAnd this Battle Tower is making that dream\ncome true!\c\nSo come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nThink you and I can get even stronger, too?\nA fierce battle is the only way to do it!
Looking back at when I first met you in\nWedgehurst, the path to this place feels...\r\nwell, short in one way, but so long in others.\c\nAllow me to be the one who faces you in the\ngreatest-ever match here at the Battle Tower!
I knew you had it in you, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nI was sure you and your Pokémon would blast\nright through the first stage of the Battle Tower!\c\nBut don’t go thinking you’ve seen all the Battle\nTower has to offer. We’re only getting started!
Your Pokémon certainly look delighted to battle\nalongside you, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nBut of course they do! They’re lucky enough to\nbattle with a Trainer who knows just how to draw\r\nout the best of them!\c\nThat’s it. I’m gonna be sure to draw out even more\nof my own team members from now on, too!
The strong desire to win!\c\nThat’s the trigger that makes you accumulate new\nskills and transform experience into strength!\c\nAnd you and your team—you’ve got a real great\ndesire to win, don’t you! Love it!\c\nBut you still haven’t seen the real challenge the\nBattle Tower is waiting to throw at you!
Now, that’s an absolutely champion time!\c\nThe stronger you get, the more the Trainers here\nat the Battle Tower burn with the desire to be\r\nthe one to beat you and break your streak!\c\nTheir Pokémon are all sharpening their teeth\nand claws in anticipation!\c\nAnd I’ll be putting together my greatest ever\nteam, too. Naturally!\c\nSo, do your best to reach me once again!
The greatest battle of the Battle Tower is over...\c\nBut at least since it was between you and me...\nNo, since it was between your team and mine,\r\nwe managed to make it one brilliant match!\c\nChampion! I hope this isn’t the last time I get\nto meet you in battle! Keep challenging me!\r\nSo that I can keep reaching ever greater heights!
[~ 182]
Please select a battle format and the Pokémon\nyou’d like to take part.
Then in you go!
Thank you for coming.\nThis is the Battle Tower!
Can I help you with something?
Would you like to continue battling?
Good work in there!\nThe Battle Tower is ready whenever you are!
Oh, that’s a shame to see...\nWe look forward to your next challenge.
Congratulations! You’ve moved up in the ranks!\nYou’re now Rank [VAR 012E(0000)]!
You’ve earned a reward for moving up through\nthe ranks!
The Judge function has been unlocked!\nYou can now use it in your Boxes!
You can now choose which background music\nyou’d like to listen to in the Battle Tower!
Congratulations on the fine job defeating\nLeon in the Master Ball Tier!\c\nWe have a special Ribbon for the Pokémon\nin your party!
The Battle Tower is quite what it says on the tin.\nIt’s a place where you can have Pokémon battles.\c\nYou can battle following the same rules as you\nmight in Ranked Battles.\c\nIf you win, you can earn Rare Candies and BP.\c\nYou can use Rental Teams, too, so no worries that\nyou need a perfect team of your own to take part!
I want to battle
Tell me about this place
No, thanks
Keep battling
You obtained [VAR 0201(0002)] [VAR 0109(0001)]!
You earned [VAR 0201(0003)] BP!
You got Leon’s rare League Card!
You got a new uniform!
Lend me a team!
Never mind
Lend me this team!
Tell me about this team!
Show me another team!
You want to borrow one of my Battle Teams?
Come talk to me whenever you want to borrow\na proper team of Pokémon.
What sort of team would you like to take\nfor a spin?
Ah... Looks like you’ve rented all the teams\nyou can right now.
You’re interested in this Battle Team?
Put ’em through their paces!
You’re already borrowing this team.
Basic Team
Skill Team
Tough Team
Rain Team
Slow Team
Never mind
This team is good for Single Battles!\nIt’s a nice, simple team that’s built around three\r\nPokémon close to the heart of anyone in Galar.\c\nTake a good hard look at what types of Pokémon\nyour opponent is sending out, then choose one\r\nof these great allies to send out yourself!
This team is good for Single Battles!\nThe Pokémon on this team know tons of moves\r\nthat can help them boost their stats in battle.\c\nSend out Duraludon first and have it use Reflect\nor Light Screen to get a defensive advantage,\r\nthen swap in others as fit for the situation!
This team is good for Single Battles!\nThis almighty team is ready for any opponents.\c\nOf course they can unleash heavy hit after heavy\nhit, but if you also use their status moves wisely,\r\nthen you might even be able to pull out a win\r\nagainst opponents that might usually put you in\r\na real sticky situation!
This rain-ready team is good for Double Battles!\c\nFalling rain can boost the power of their moves\nor trigger certain Abilities, so start by sending\r\nout Pelipper first to get the rain going and get\c\nthis team rolling!
This team is good for Double Battles!\nThey might look real slow to start with, but all\r\nyou need is a good Trick Room, and suddenly\r\nyour slow bulky team will be a fast bulky team!\c\nLucario will be great support if you know how to\nuse it, so hurry straight into a Trick Room!
[~ 227]
And that’s not all!\nYou’ve reached the [VAR 012E(0001)]!
[~ 229]
That drops you down a rank, I’m afraid...
I’ll give you one of my League Cards...\nAnd not just any old one—this is a rare one!
All right! You should take this.\nI reckon it’ll fit you as well as it could anyone.
Mr. Al Rent
You rented [VAR 01BF(0000)]!

Benedict
Yaaay! I won! I won!\nI totally, definitely won!
I’m going home!
[~ 3]
[~ 4]
Marko
Oh my...\nI didn’t expect to win.
Impressive!\nYou’re quite the Trainer!
[~ 8]
[~ 9]
Brent
This is to be expected.\nI am the king of all youngsters, after all!
Next time I’ll come back with long pants...
[~ 13]
[~ 14]
Ellie
I wasn’t ready, but I won anyway!
I wasn’t ready!\nI would have won, otherwise!
[~ 18]
[~ 19]
Ava
Yay! I won!\nI gave it all my energy, and it paid off!
Aww, I lost... Still, I won’t let this bring me down!\nI’ll always give my best!
[~ 23]
[~ 24]
Moira
Huh.\nI guess I didn’t need to go all out on you.
Hey! I was only battling at 2 percent of my\nfull power, OK?!
[~ 28]
[~ 29]
Finley
I knew my hunch was right!
That does it! I’m studying up on how to get sweet\nrevenge next!
[~ 33]
[~ 34]
Reu
That victory’s for all my mates in the\nPokémon club!
I...I don’t deserve to be the president of the\nPokémon club...
[~ 38]
[~ 39]
Theodore
I’m so strong, I must have made you flinch!
You didn’t even flinch!\nWhat, is your Ability Inner Focus or something?
[~ 43]
[~ 44]
Zara
Wow, I won...?\nOh dear, I don’t think I can keep this up...
I knew I couldn’t do it...
[~ 48]
[~ 49]
Dusk
Huh? I didn’t know I was this strong!
Wait—have we even met before...?
[~ 53]
[~ 54]
Holly
Looks like my Pokémon are both stronger and\ncuter than yours!
I still win at being cute!\nEven against your Pokémon!
[~ 58]
[~ 59]
Albert
Pika!
Pika...
[~ 63]
[~ 64]
Blake
I’m gonna keep dressing up as a Pikachu, even\nwhen I’m all grown-up!
I guess being relaxed doesn’t make me stronger!
[~ 68]
[~ 69]
Robin
See? See?!\nI knew my Pokémon were strong!
But...but how?!\nHow could I have lost?
[~ 73]
[~ 74]
Alex
Vee!
Ee... Vee...?
[~ 78]
[~ 79]
Dromena
Hee hee hee! I bet you thought I was just a\nscared, lost child!
I was hoping you’d let your guard down around a\nlost child...
[~ 83]
[~ 84]
Penelope
Shhh... Just go to sleep.
Nighty-night!
[~ 88]
[~ 89]
Clarence
Hya-haaa! This is the strength of an adult!
That’s not what I’d call “going easy”...
[~ 93]
[~ 94]
Stanley
I just got a message from my boss!\nI need to get back to the office!
Well, that’s that...\nMy break time sure went quickly...
[~ 98]
[~ 99]
Hugo
Exchanging business cards is basic\nbusiness etiquette!
Since we’re both Trainers, I guess we could trade\nLeague Cards.
[~ 103]
[~ 104]
Sayla
Victory’s always so refreshing!\nNow, if I could only finish my work as easily...
Great, now I’m stressed out about losing on top\nof being stressed out about work!
[~ 108]
[~ 109]
Orla
I gave my 110 percent. It’s the optimal strategy\nto achieve exponential growth!
We’re seeing a downturn in projected results.\nI need more synergistic interactions on my team.
[~ 113]
[~ 114]
Thea
Maybe it’s not too late for me to become a\nGym Leader!
It’s not going to happen if I’m so easily defeated,\nI guess...
[~ 118]
[~ 119]
Stan
Wow, I beat the Champion!\nMaybe I can give you my autograph?
Aw, I lost!\nI don’t want an autograph anymore!
[~ 123]
[~ 124]
Brenner
Wearing brand-name shorts really does make you\nstronger in battle!
I was too busy worrying about my brand-name\nshorts! I couldn’t focus!
[~ 128]
[~ 129]
Kushi
Oops! Guess I showed your Pokémon a little too\nmuch love!
That’s not what I meant when I said show them\na bit of love!
[~ 133]
[~ 134]
Darcie
No, no, wait!\nI didn’t really mean it!
Whew... I know I lost, but I’m a little relieved.
[~ 138]
[~ 139]
Bon
Just as I calculated!
But you only had a 5 percent chance to\ndefeat me!
[~ 143]
[~ 144]
Albie
That’s going to be a wicked video!\nDon’t forget to give it a good rating!
M-my followers won’t let you get away with this!
[~ 148]
[~ 149]
Sienna
... ... ...\nI win.
... ... ...\n*sniff*
[~ 153]

Silky
I did it!\nNow I’ll be popular!
No! I don’t want to be unpopular!
[~ 158]
[~ 159]
Fero
I’m serious about this...\nI won’t let anyone tell me it’s just play!
I guess it must look like some game, huh...
[~ 163]
[~ 164]
Avit
Time for my pika-perfect smile!
Pika pika...
[~ 168]
[~ 169]
Kaelie
Me and my friends put in a lot of work to catch\nmy Pokémon, but it was worth it!
But I worked hard with my friends to catch these\nPokémon in the Wild Area!
[~ 173]
[~ 174]
Katherine
Perhaps now you appreciate my strength?
Oh dear!
[~ 178]
[~ 179]
Diego
You’re below the lower end of average.
I’m on the lower end of average, so I know\nmy place.
[~ 183]
[~ 184]
Patton
Now that will burn off some calories!
The only ones getting a workout were\nmy Pokémon!
[~ 188]
[~ 189]
Stella
That’ll get me likes!
Gonna make a post of me looking sad!
[~ 193]
[~ 194]
Krysia
I guess you’ll never find out what work I do!
I’m actually the department manager.\nWe could use somebody like you on our team!
[~ 198]
[~ 199]
Matthew
I won that battle because I’m an early riser!\nEarly to rise makes Pokémon healthy, as they say!
We were too sleepy to battle at full strength...\nI guess a well-rested Pokémon is never bested.
[~ 203]
[~ 204]
Winslow
It’s all about what moves your Pokémon know\nwhen you leave them at the Pokémon Nursery!
I wonder if Pokémon already know moves when\nthey’re still inside Eggs?
[~ 208]
[~ 209]
Waylin
Love for your Pokémon is the key to victory!
Not enough love...?\nI need to love my Pokémon much more!
[~ 213]
[~ 214]
Therme
Easy peasy!\nLess trouble than work, that was!
I’m better at my work than I am at battling,\nI guess...
[~ 218]
[~ 219]
Columban
Victory third!
Defeat third!\n...Wait, no—that’s not right.
[~ 223]
[~ 224]
Egbert
A smooth and comfortable victory, just like a\nwell-maintained train!
Battling with Pokémon is nothing like maintaining\ntrains, it seems...
[~ 228]
[~ 229]
Rikke
Told you we’ve got the heart for this!
Your nerves were stronger than ours...
[~ 233]
[~ 234]
Isabelle
Ha! I tricked you into thinking I was weak\nand helpless!
Oh come on. Did you think I was trying to pull\none over on you or something?
[~ 238]
[~ 239]
Mornix
Hm.\nMaybe you should shower more often.
You are strong, just as I suspected!\nI wish to have a rematch sometime!
[~ 243]
[~ 244]
Tsapeli
Those online karate courses really paid off!
Maybe I should just learn Galarian karate the\nreal way... I don’t like being hurt, though...
[~ 248]
[~ 249]
Jung
The mountains granted me victory!\nMountains truly are the best places to be!
Wonderful! This gives me an excuse to spend\neven more time up in the mountains!
[~ 253]
[~ 254]
Graymond
That’s thanks to my ab-solute power!\nThough you can’t see my abs through my shirt.
Oh, I guess you can tell, huh?\nYeah, I’m just wearing a lumpy shirt.
[~ 258]
[~ 259]
Celinda
This is such an interesting facility!\nThanks for the battle!
I need to visit every tourist attraction in the\nGalar region!
[~ 263]
[~ 264]
Ajani
Aww, you let me win!\nThat’s very nice of you!
*sob* That wasn’t very nice!\nMy tears now stain the lands of Galar!
[~ 268]
[~ 269]
Feng
I had me a good tail wind, just like when you ride\nmy Flying Taxi!
I keep battles and work separate, mate.\nYou can always give me a call if you need a ride!
[~ 273]
[~ 274]
Daltz
Looks like you were headed for defeat!
Well, we’ve arrived at your victory!
[~ 278]
[~ 279]
Maggie
Aaaaaand I caught a big one!
Hmph! That was just beginner’s luck for you!
[~ 283]
[~ 284]
Bate
I’m even more partial to winning battles!
Not too fond of losing...
[~ 288]
[~ 289]
Nick
Oh, you’re just a small fry.\nYou’re free to go!
Oh, I do beg your pardon...\nI didn’t realize you were the Champion.
[~ 293]
[~ 294]
Booker
Nothing to report here!\nAll is well!
I ditched work to come here, only to get\nsoundly defeated...
[~ 298]
[~ 299]
Astraea
A model needs to win with beauty!
I still have much to learn as a model...
[~ 303]
[~ 304]
Berti
My brilliance clearly has blinded you!
You’re really good!\nSay, why don’t you become a model?
[~ 308]
[~ 309]
Finn
A finely brewed victory for me!
Maybe you should come work at my shop!
[~ 313]
[~ 314]
Vassallo
A truly rich and refined battle...\nWell? What do you think?
You’re still so young, and yet your battle style is\nso rich and deep...
[~ 318]
[~ 319]
Isla
And that is how true nobility handle themselves\nin Pokémon battles.
I suggest you be extra careful when wandering\naround at night...
[~ 323]
[~ 324]
Laguna
Your Pokémon are...\nWell, they’re not bad, but not what I want.
I want your Pokémon! Please, would you be\nwilling to part with them? No?
[~ 328]
[~ 329]
Gig
My Pokémon are good and strong!\nThat’s why I sing this song! ♪
So we lost the battle and... ♪\nUh... I can’t think of any good rhymes.
[~ 333]
[~ 334]
Jay
Thank you, thank you!\nThank you very much!
Whoa, stop! Stop the music right now!
[~ 338]
[~ 339]
Tricia
Backup dancers can provide synergy!\nAll we need to do is dance, dance, and dance!
Blast! I was supposed to make the main\nperformers shine!
[~ 343]
[~ 344]
Tiff
I’m so happy, I could do an improvised dance\nright here!
You had me dancing in the palm of your hand...
[~ 348]
[~ 349]
Noel
See? This is exactly what I mean.
The problem is that strong Trainers like you just\nshow up out of nowhere!
[~ 353]
[~ 354]
Maya
What? I won?\nNo WAY!
Now I can brag to my friends that I was defeated\nby the Champion h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imerself!
[~ 358]
[~ 359]
York
I did it!\nI hope my girlfriend’s winning her way up, too.
Waaah!\nWhat am I supposed to tell my girlfriend?
[~ 363]
[~ 364]
Gelete
Hee hee! I hope my boyfriend’s able to win like\nthis, too!
*sniff* Fine, then!\nI’ll just vent to my boyfriend!
[~ 368]
[~ 369]
Savvas
My evasiveness rose sharply!
Some of your Pokémon’s moves grazed me...
[~ 373]
[~ 374]
Madi
Hee hee hee.\nJust what I wanted!
My mum always says that to my dad!
[~ 378]
[~ 379]
Keanu
*sigh*\nI keep getting better at Pokémon, but...
You and your Pokémon seem to have a lot of fun\nin battles!
[~ 383]
[~ 384]
Hertz
WE ARE VICTORIOUS.\nI GIVE THANKS TO MY POKÉMON.
I WISH TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE\nHUMAN SOUL...

You need to raise them more!
They’re well raised—that’s for sure!

Good babies! Such good babies!
Hey, don’t be mean to my babies!
[~ 398]
[~ 399]
Cornelius
Here, just watch me flex!
I’m not as tough as I look?\nOh come on. Don’t say that...
[~ 403]
[~ 404]
Ann
Well, that worked out all right!\nIf I win, that’s all that matters!
I’m gonna stop you right there.\nYou’re too strong for your own good!
[~ 408]
[~ 409]
Davis
Maybe not the best motive to start a job, but it’s\nsure made me stronger!
I guess it’s just a myth that being a League staff\nmember makes you popular...
[~ 413]
[~ 414]
Oratoria
Hey, don’t make me seem harsh!
Your Pokémon, the way you battle—it’s all\nso grating!
[~ 418]
[~ 419]
Wenson
The operation is over.
I get very uneasy if I don’t have my scalpel\nwith me.
[~ 423]
[~ 424]
Lia
Hmm, it seems like they could do with a little bit\nmore strength...
They’re fit as a fiddle!\nNothing to worry about at all!
[~ 428]
[~ 429]
Elwood
Art and battling, battling and art...\nDo you understand now?
No need to get so worked up!\nI’m just making stuff up as I go!
[~ 433]
[~ 434]
Mika
You’re so adorable!\nI hope we can battle again sometime!
Your battle style isn’t cute at all.
[~ 438]
[~ 439]
Wellington
What I just showed you is the proper,\ngentlemanly etiquette for battle.
Keep it together, me... You’re a gentleman...\nA gentleman... Blast it all!
[~ 443]
[~ 444]
Fairamay
You’re such a sweet child, letting an old lady like\nme win and all!
Oh deary me, I look away and I’ve already lost!
[~ 448]
[~ 449]
McKinzie
I don’t literally wear lots of hats, you know.
They say that he who chases two Meowth catches\nnone. I guess that’s true...
[~ 453]
[~ 454]
Walden
I’m desperate to keep my place here.\nI can’t lose!
Are you going to take away the one place I\nfit in?!
[~ 458]
[~ 459]
Waldna
You’re the same as everyone else.\nSuch a shame.
You... You’re not bad.
[~ 463]
[~ 464]
Rennie
See? I told you!\nI’m a proper lady!
Maybe I lost because I don’t have enough\npocket money...
[~ 468]
[~ 469]
Curon
A bam and a crash, just like that!
Whaaaaaat?!
[~ 473]
[~ 474]
Cadet
I win, and then I battle another, stronger Trainer,\nand...it just keeps going.
I see it now! When you lose, you get frustrated,\nso you become stronger and try again!
[~ 478]
[~ 479]
Agila
I know my dream will come true if I keep doing\nmy best!
I won’t let one defeat bring me down!\nI’m serious about my dream!
[~ 483]
[~ 484]
Laelia
Oh, I’m just joking. My age hasn’t even reached\ndouble digits yet!
A battle is fine and all, but I was hoping you’d\nat least react to that joke...
[~ 488]
[~ 489]
Freeman
I send out my Pokémon, select effective moves...\nand win.
Agh!\nMy routine!
[~ 493]
[~ 494]
Marvo
Wrong stop or not, I had fun!\nI guess it’s good to take a breather now and then.
Getting defeated in the Battle Tower...\nYou know, it was actually kind of refreshing.
[~ 498]
[~ 499]
Prudence
Eek! I hope I didn’t upset you...
Eek! Did you just think I was too self-conscious?

Another victory for cuteness!
My Pokémon are still adorable!

Watch out for my Pokémon as we accelerate\ntoward victory!
Your Pokémon were amazing...\nlike an express train!

I win!\nNow, you must taste my latest dish!
I was hoping I could get you to try my cooking\nif I’d won...

Some moves become more powerful if the\nPokémon using them is heavy!
Some moves become more powerful if the\nPokémon being hit is heavy!

Doesn’t matter much to me, really.\nI like working with metal, too!
Oh well, I’ve had worse days.

Mason
Whew! A refreshing victory!
A helmet can get dreadfully hot inside...
[~ 548]

Critical hits deal an extra 50 percent damage!
Critical hits only land about 4 percent of the time...
[~ 553]

Harvey
I won on two hours of sleep!\nOnly two hours, I tell you!
I lost ’cause I’m sleepy...\nOnly two hours of sleep will do that...
[~ 558]
[~ 559]
Aya
Well, I thought you looked strong, but...
Ha! I knew you were strong!\nI told you I could tell!
[~ 563]
[~ 564]
Rachael
I think I’m gonna head home and loaf around\nwith my Pokémon now.
See, this is why I didn’t wanna battle in the first\nplace! I’m going home to veg out!
[~ 568]
[~ 569]
North
Aaaaaand cut! That was perfect!
Take two! Take two!\nUh...no take two?

I’ll send you the video later.
I’m so zoomed in, I can’t see a thing!

Please, tell me how you feel about your defeat!
OK then, now for that interview...\nWait—what? It’s over? We’re out of time?!

Narra
Now I should interview myself about my\namazing victory!
Uh, well then...\nBack to you folks at the studio!

Hey, I wasn’t supposed to become YOUR fan!

I hope you enjoyed my wide selection of moves.
I’m afraid my move sampling event is coming to\nits end...
[~ 603]
[~ 604]
Rister
I’d be happy to have a chat about your Pokémon\nteam whenever you’d like.
A truly impressive assortment of moves!\nI’ll see you again in the Pokémon Center!
[~ 608]
[~ 609]
Crawly
Each meeting is a miracle! Thank you for adding\na little bit more brilliance to my life.
Whether I win or lose doesn’t really matter.\nEither way, I grow as a person!
[~ 613]
[~ 614]
Lila
Whew! That helped me blow off steam.\nSo, uh... What was I doing again?
Agh! I’m all flustered!\nHow am I suppose to follow leads now?!
[~ 618]
[~ 619]
Desmond
That’ll be 2,000,000 per ticket!\nOh, but each one does come with a drink!
Pleeease, you gotta buy a ticket!\nI’ve got so many left over!

I lost the rhythm!\nA slow tempo throws me off...

Mum, Dad, I’ll be home soon!
No, you don’t understand—I WANT to go home!\nPlease, let me go home!
[~ 638]

Blau
Maybe you’re a bit young to join the police, eh?
You’ve definitely got the talent!\nSure you don’t want to join us?
[~ 643]

Sheriff
Heh, sorry ’bout that.\nI was just thinkin’ back to the old days.
Whoa now... You’re more off the rails than I was!

Sorry, but I really must get to my yoga class!
Your breathing, your movements...\nDo you do yoga, too?!

I-I was so nervous, I couldn’t hold back!
Oof! But you’re strong!\nI’d like to battle you again someday!
[~ 663]

Bartholomew
Shorts make you strong! Feel the bracing air\nabout your legs, and remember that!
I’m the one to blame here, not the shorts!\nThe shorts did nothing wrong!
[~ 668]
[~ 669]
Laramie
There are more important things than tests.\nFor me, my Pokémon are one of those things.
OK, guess it’s back to revising for me...\nLet’s see—16 times 16 equals 256, and...
[~ 673]
[~ 674]
Mindy
So did you hear me?\nIt’s up to you to decide what you believe.
Crumbs! I spoke aloud!

Yes, yes, here it is: your defeat.\nJust sign here, would you?
Looks like someone nicked my victory...
[~ 683]

Hahaha!\nSee the difference that experience makes?
N-no!\nI think I threw my back out from the shock!

Even if I can’t see through my glasses, I can\neasily find my way to victory!
Everything’s gone white! I can’t see a thing!\nAugh, these blasted glasses!
[~ 693]
[~ 694]
Niel
Come on, then. Give me your arm.\nIt’ll just be a little poke...
B-but I want to give someone a jab!\nWhy couldn’t you have just let me win?
[~ 698]
[~ 699]
Angie
Hah! Don’t mind me while I soar above you!
Oh no!\nLooks like I’ve fallen from grace...
[~ 703]

Nav
See? Got you to your defeat in no time at all.
See? I got you right ahead to the next match.
[~ 713]
[~ 714]
Tosh
You can tip me whatever you think I deserve.\nI think we both know I deserve plenty.
See? I was making sure you’d be comfortable\nby letting you win. So how about a tip?
[~ 718]
[~ 719]
Rei
What? You think something’s wrong with\nthe way I raise my Pokémon?
Even in top condition, my Pokémon couldn’t win!\nWhat is this...?
[~ 723]
[~ 724]
Greta
See, it’s not enough to have a great specimen.\nYou’ve got to know what to do with it.
Wow! You certainly know what to do with a\ngreat specimen, don’t you?
[~ 728]
[~ 729]
Chad
So...did you understand all that?
Yup! I got it!\nThat really got through to me!
[~ 733]
[~ 734]
Reese
How you raise your Pokémon has a lot to do\nwith how they grow!
Please...teach me!\nI want to know how you’ve raised your Pokémon!

Thank you. And farewell.
That...that was the most pleasurable time I’ve\nexperienced in a very long while.

If you spend your money right, you can become\nincredibly powerful! Gwahahaha!
M-my money...wasn’t enough?!\nDid I go wrong somewhere, or...?
[~ 748]
[~ 749]
Navin
What a delightful feeling! This is what I never\ngot to taste when every day was the same!
Getting to meet with new people like you is\nprecisely what makes Pokémon so wonderful.
[~ 753]
[~ 754]
Tansy
Oh yes! Lovely! And winning is great for the\nskin as well. Takes 10 years right off you!
Oooh! You! Now how am I to face the other\nladies at the club?!
[~ 758]
[~ 759]
Anselm
So, did you pick up how my Pokémon battle?\nOr were their moves too quick for you?
Now those were quite the moves you showed me!
[~ 763]
[~ 764]
Hardy
*scritch scritch* Oh, sorry... Did you attack?\n*scritch scritch* I didn’t even notice...
*scritch scritch* You scratched us right out...\n*scritch scritch* Guess I’ll focus on my carving...
[~ 768]
[~ 769]
Ulster
I didn’t even get to show off my moves...\nMaybe I should battle against Pokémon instead...
If only I’d been the one battling... That’s it!\nMy team and I must undergo further training!
[~ 773]

Wotson
Wot wot! How d’you like that, then?
Wotcher!

A fine match! Very well done!\nI’d expected nothing less from you!
[~ 783]
[~ 784]
Adrienne
I certainly was able to read your mind.\nThat’s how I reeled you right in.
My word, I couldn’t get a read on you!\nNo wonder you’re the Champion...
[~ 788]
[~ 789]
Chelsea
Do you prefer sea fishing or river fishing?\nFavorite bait? Favorite lure?
Next let’s have a fishing battle!\nYou will become my fishing buddy, won’t you?
[~ 793]
[~ 794]
Torren
The building’s name is actually Rose Tower,\nbut everyone just calls it the Battle Tower!
I should have known better... All these smooth\nsurfaces have nothing to offer a hiker!
[~ 798]
[~ 799]
Gram
Bwahaha! I’m climbing straight up until I reach\nthe top this time!
And down I go...\nAll the way down to rock bottom...
[~ 803]
[~ 804]
Nat
You were powerless before the great power of\nboundless nature!
Nature might be boundless, but it seems my\npower was not...
[~ 808]
[~ 809]
Ulva
Oooh, sorry ’bout that!\nGuess I should’ve gone a bit easier on you?
I do like young ones who train their Pokémon\nup to be so strong, like you.
[~ 813]
[~ 814]
Polly
Please! I’m begging you! Just one night at the\nRose of the Rondelands here in Wyndon!
Or do you have a garden at home? Even a bit\nof grass? Please, just let me stay!
[~ 818]
[~ 819]
Lazlo
And that’s what battle looks like when you don’t\nlet up until the last move has been unleashed.
I lost my focus for a single second, and that was\nit... That was when the battle was lost for me...
[~ 823]
[~ 824]
Allegra
That was a jolly good time!\nThanks! I love Pokémon—don’t you?
Even losing the battle, that was a jolly fun match!\nLet’s do it again sometime!
[~ 828]
[~ 829]
Ander
And so I will continue to battle and battle...\nJust like my hero, Leader Kabu!
I’m so tired of battle...\nBut still I will battle onward...
[~ 833]
[~ 834]
Hestia
Well, that’s a right shame...\nI wanted a thorough trouncing to get fired up!
Ahahahah! Brilliant! You’re just the thing!\nThat was just what I wanted to feel! Hahaha!
[~ 838]
[~ 839]
Alan
There’s no victory without sacrifice.
How did you manage to seize that sort of\nstrength without giving anything up?!
[~ 843]
[~ 844]
Eva
I can still ewolve more!\nBut your Ewolution got canceled. Bye-bye!
Did you ewolve more than me?\nMaybe I need an Ewolution stone...
[~ 848]
[~ 849]
Cooper
Our department is the best! Nothing better than\nbeing truly serious in everything that you do!
B-but our department goals...\nThey won’t look leniently on this loss!
[~ 853]
[~ 854]
Becka
Ahhh! That’s the ticket! I feel so much better!\nAll I need beside me is my Pokémon.
Now you’ve gone and broken my heart, too...\nAt least I’ve still got my Pokémon beside me...
[~ 858]
[~ 859]
Leon
Come on—remember our final match!\nIs this really the best you can do?!
Battling against a Champion like you...\nIt really is the best...\c\nAnd since you managed to defeat me, you’ll be\nmoving up the ranks here at the Battle Tower.
[~ 863]
[~ 864]

There is a plant seed on its back right from the\nday this Pokémon is born. The seed slowly\ngrows larger.
When the bulb on its back grows large, it\nappears to lose the ability to stand on its\nhind legs.
Its plant blooms when it is absorbing solar\nenergy. It stays on the move to seek sunlight.
It has a preference for hot things. When it rains,\nsteam is said to spout from the tip of its tail.
It has a barbaric nature. In battle, it whips its\nfiery tail around and slashes away with sharp claws.
It spits fire that is hot enough to melt boulders.\nIt may cause forest fires by blowing flames.
When it retracts its long neck into its shell, it\nsquirts out water with vigorous force.
It is recognized as a symbol of longevity. If its\nshell has algae on it, that Wartortle is very old.
It crushes its foe under its heavy body to cause\nfainting. In a pinch, it will withdraw inside its shell.
For protection, it releases a horrible stench from\nthe antenna on its head to drive away enemies.
It is waiting for the moment to evolve. At this\nstage, it can only harden, so it remains\nmotionless to avoid attack.
In battle, it flaps its wings at great speed to\nrelease highly toxic dust into the air.












Pikachu that can generate powerful electricity\nhave cheek sacs that are extra soft and\nsuper stretchy.
Its long tail serves as a ground to protect itself\nfrom its own high-voltage power.
It loves to bathe in the grit of dry, sandy areas.\nBy sand bathing, the Pokémon rids itself of dirt\nand moisture clinging to its body.
The drier the area Sandslash lives in, the harder\nand smoother the Pokémon’s spikes will feel\nwhen touched.
Females are more sensitive to smells than males.\nWhile foraging, they’ll use their whiskers to check\nwind direction and stay downwind of predators.
The horn on its head has atrophied. It’s thought\nthat this happens so Nidorina’s children won’t get\npoked while their mother is feeding them.
Nidoqueen is better at defense than offense.\nWith scales like armor, this Pokémon will shield\nits children from any kind of attack.
The horn on a male Nidoran’s forehead contains\na powerful poison. This is a very cautious\nPokémon, always straining its large ears.
With a horn that’s harder than diamond, this\nPokémon goes around shattering boulders as it\nsearches for a moon stone.
When it goes on a rampage, it’s impossible to\ncontrol. But in the presence of a Nidoqueen it’s\nlived with for a long time, Nidoking calms down.
It is said that happiness will come to those who\nsee a gathering of Clefairy dancing under a\nfull moon.
A timid fairy Pokémon that is rarely seen, it will\nrun and hide the moment it senses people.
While young, it has six gorgeous tails. When it\ngrows, several new tails are sprouted.
It is said to live 1,000 years, and each of its tails\nis loaded with supernatural powers.
Jigglypuff has top-notch lung capacity, even by\ncomparison to other Pokémon. It won’t stop\nsinging its lullabies until its foes fall asleep.
The more air it takes in, the more it inflates. If\nopponents catch it in a bad mood, it will inflate\nitself to an enormous size to intimidate them.
It emits ultrasonic waves from its mouth to check\nits surroundings. Even in tight caves, Zubat flies\naround with skill.
It loves to drink other creatures’ blood. It’s said\nthat if it finds others of its kind going hungry,\nit sometimes shares the blood it’s gathered.
If exposed to moonlight, it starts to move.\nIt roams far and wide at night to scatter its seeds.
Its pistils exude an incredibly foul odor.\nThe horrid stench can cause fainting at a distance\nof 1.25 miles.
It has the world’s largest petals. With every step,\nthe petals shake out heavy clouds of toxic pollen.




If a Diglett digs through a field, it leaves the soil\nperfectly tilled and ideal for planting crops.
A team of Diglett triplets. It triggers huge\nearthquakes by burrowing 60 miles underground.
It loves to collect shiny things. If it’s in a good\nmood, it might even let its Trainer have a look\nat its hoard of treasures.
Getting this prideful Pokémon to warm up to you\ntakes a lot of effort, and it will claw at you the\nmoment it gets annoyed.
Psyduck is constantly beset by headaches. If the\nPokémon lets its strange power erupt, apparently\nthe pain subsides for a while.
This Pokémon lives in gently flowing rivers. It\npaddles through the water with its long limbs,\nputting its graceful swimming skills on display.


It has a brave and trustworthy nature. It fearlessly\nstands up to bigger and stronger foes.
The sight of it running over 6,200 miles\nin a single day and night has captivated\nmany people.
For Poliwag, swimming is easier than walking.\nThe swirl pattern on its belly is actually part of\nthe Pokémon’s innards showing through the skin.
Staring at the swirl on its belly causes drowsiness.\nThis trait of Poliwhirl’s has been used in place of\nlullabies to get children to go to sleep.
Its body is solid muscle. When swimming through\ncold seas, Poliwrath uses its impressive arms to\nsmash through drift ice and plow forward.
This Pokémon uses its psychic powers while it\nsleeps. The contents of Abra’s dreams affect the\npowers that the Pokémon wields.
Using its psychic power, Kadabra levitates as it\nsleeps. It uses its springy tail as a pillow.
It has an incredibly high level of intelligence.\nSome say that Alakazam remembers everything\nthat ever happens to it, from birth till death.
Its whole body is composed of muscles.\nEven though it’s the size of a human child, it can\nhurl 100 grown-ups.
Its muscular body is so powerful, it must wear a\npower-save belt to be able to regulate\nits motions.
It quickly swings its four arms to rock its\nopponents with ceaseless punches and chops\nfrom all angles.



Tentacool is not a particularly strong swimmer.\nIt drifts across the surface of shallow seas as it\nsearches for prey.
When the red orbs on Tentacruel’s head glow\nbrightly, watch out. The Pokémon is about to\nfire off a burst of ultrasonic waves.



It can’t run properly when it’s newly born.\nAs it races around with others of its kind,\nits legs grow stronger.
This Pokémon can be seen galloping through\nfields at speeds of up to 150 mph, its fiery mane\nfluttering in the wind.
Slow-witted and oblivious, this Pokémon won’t\nfeel any pain if its tail gets eaten. It won’t notice\nwhen its tail grows back, either.
Slowpoke became Slowbro when a Shellder bit\non to its tail. Sweet flavors seeping from the tail\nmake the Shellder feel as if its life is a dream.
At times, Magnemite runs out of electricity and\nends up on the ground. If you give batteries to a\ngrounded Magnemite, it’ll start moving again.
This Pokémon is three Magnemite that have\nlinked together. Magneton sends out powerful\nradio waves to study its surroundings.
The stalk this Pokémon carries in its wings serves\nas a sword to cut down opponents. In a dire\nsituation, the stalk can also serve as food.






It swims facing backward by opening and closing\nits two-piece shell. It is surprisingly fast.
Its shell is extremely hard. It cannot be shattered,\neven with a bomb. The shell opens only when it\nis attacking.
Born from gases, anyone would faint if engulfed\nby its gaseous body, which contains poison.
Its tongue is made of gas. If licked, its victim\nstarts shaking constantly until death\neventually comes.
On the night of a full moon, if shadows move on\ntheir own and laugh, it must be Gengar’s doing.
As it digs through the ground, it absorbs many\nhard objects. This is what makes its body so solid.


It can be found near the sea. The large pincers\ngrow back if they are torn out of their sockets.
Its large and hard pincer has 10,000-horsepower\nstrength. However, being so big, it is unwieldy\nto move.


Though it may look like it’s just a bunch of eggs,\nit’s a proper Pokémon. Exeggcute communicates\nwith others of its kind via telepathy, apparently.
Each of Exeggutor’s three heads is thinking\ndifferent thoughts. The three don’t seem to be\nvery interested in one another.
When the memory of its departed mother brings\nit to tears, its cries echo mournfully within the\nskull it wears on its head.
This Pokémon overcame its sorrow to evolve a\nsturdy new body. Marowak faces its opponents\nbravely, using a bone as a weapon.
This amazing Pokémon has an awesome sense of\nbalance. It can kick in succession from any position.
Its punches slice the air. They are launched at\nsuch high speed, even a slight graze could cause\na burn.
If this Pokémon’s sticky saliva gets on you and\nyou don’t clean it off, an intense itch will set in.\nThe itch won’t go away, either.
Its body is full of poisonous gas. It floats into\ngarbage dumps, seeking out the fumes of raw,\nrotting trash.
It mixes gases between its two bodies.\nIt’s said that these Pokémon were seen\nall over the Galar region back in the day.
Strong, but not too bright, this Pokémon can\nshatter even a skyscraper with its charging tackles.
It begins walking on its hind legs after evolution.\nIt can punch holes through boulders with its horn.
The egg Chansey carries is not only delicious\nbut also packed with nutrition. It’s used as a\nhigh-class cooking ingredient.
Hidden beneath a tangle of vines that grows\nnonstop even if the vines are torn off, this\nPokémon’s true appearance remains a mystery.
Although it’s carrying its baby in a pouch on\nits belly, Kangaskhan is swift on its feet. It\nintimidates its opponents with quick jabs.
Horsea makes its home in oceans with gentle\ncurrents. If this Pokémon is under attack, it spits\nout pitch-black ink and escapes.
It’s the males that raise the offspring. While\nSeadra are raising young, the spines on their\nbacks secrete thicker and stronger poison.
Its dorsal, pectoral, and tail fins wave elegantly\nin water. That is why it is known as the Water Dancer.
In autumn, its body becomes more fatty in\npreparing to propose to a mate. It takes on\nbeautiful colors.
If you visit a beach at the end of summer, you’ll\nbe able to see groups of Staryu lighting up in a\nsteady rhythm.
This Pokémon has an organ known as its core.\nThe organ glows in seven colors when Starmie is\nunleashing its potent psychic powers.
The broadness of its hands may be no\ncoincidence—many scientists believe its palms\nbecame enlarged specifically for pantomiming.
As Scyther fights more and more battles, its\nscythes become sharper and sharper. With a\nsingle slice, Scyther can fell a massive tree.
In certain parts of Galar, Jynx was once feared\nand worshiped as the Queen of Ice.
Many power plants keep Ground-type Pokémon\naround as a defense against Electabuzz that\ncome seeking electricity.
Magmar dispatches its prey with fire. But it\nregrets this habit once it realizes that it has\nburned its intended prey to a charred crisp.
These Pokémon judge one another based on\npincers. Thicker, more impressive pincers make\nfor more popularity with the opposite gender.
When Tauros begins whipping itself with its tails,\nit’s a warning that the Pokémon is about to\ncharge with astounding speed.
It is virtually worthless in terms of both power\nand speed. It is the most weak and pathetic\nPokémon in the world.
It has an extremely aggressive nature.\nThe Hyper Beam it shoots from its mouth\ntotally incinerates all targets.
A smart and kindhearted Pokémon,\nit glides across the surface of the sea while\nits beautiful song echoes around it.
It can reconstitute its entire cellular\nstructure to change into what it sees,\nbut it returns to normal when it relaxes.
It has the ability to alter the composition of its\nbody to suit its surrounding environment.
When Vaporeon’s fins begin to vibrate, it is a\nsign that rain will come within a few hours.
If it is angered or startled, the fur all over its\nbody bristles like sharp needles that pierce foes.
Once it has stored up enough heat, this\nPokémon’s body temperature can reach up to\n1,700 degrees Fahrenheit.
State-of-the-art technology was used to create\nPorygon. It was the first artificial Pokémon to be\ncreated via computer programming.
Because some Omanyte manage to escape after\nbeing restored or are released into the wild by\npeople, this species is becoming a problem.
Weighed down by a large and heavy shell,\nOmastar couldn’t move very fast. Some say it\nwent extinct because it was unable to catch food.
This species is almost entirely extinct. Kabuto\nmolt every three days, making their shells harder\nand harder.

This Pokémon Trainer got endorsed to take\npart in the Gym Challenge by his brother—\nthe reigning Champion, Leon. Hop claims\nto have watched all Leon’s matches.\nCommentators speculate that as a result, he\nmight be quite the force to be reckoned\nwith. The Champion himself has said that\nhis brother has potential, but his carefully\nhoarded knowledge can go to waste as he\ntends to get easily flustered in battle.\nIt’s said that Hop’s partner Wooloo is a\ngreat help to him both in battle and with\nchores around the house.
This Trainer ultimately was defeated in the\nfinal match of the Champion Cup\nSemifinals. However, many Gym\nLeaders speak highly of his battle style,\nwhere he will let his Pokémon battle freely\nand really enjoy themselves. During the\nincident with Eternatus, he provided vital\nassistance in resolving the situation,\nproving beyond doubt that he is a skilled\nTrainer in his own right. It is expected that\nhis battles with the new Champion will be\nthe stuff of legend.

As a child, she was timid and a bit of a\ncrybaby. However, she became more\ncheerful as she played with the Pokémon\nshe received from her brother, and her\ntalents as a Trainer also grew greatly. She\njoined the Gym Challenge because she\nwishes to breathe life back into her\ndilapidated hometown, but she says she has\nbeen somewhat distracted by the boutiques\nthroughout Galar. Though many in Spikemuth\nsee her as a local celebrity, she herself\nhas no interest in pursuing fame. However,\nshe says she does appreciate the support of\nTeam Yell, her personal cheering squad.
She was appointed as the new Gym Leader\nof Spikemuth by her brother Piers. Piers\ncaught Morpeko and gave it to her when\nshe was five. She still finds herself at the\nmercy of Morpeko’s mood swings even now.\nThe local dialect of Spikemuth has a\ndistinct kick to it, and many of Marnie’s\nfans have started mimicking her.\nMarnie won’t change her expression even\nwhen she gets angry, but once something\nsets her off, she stays angry for a long time.

This Trainer was born as the son of farmers.\nHe has honed his strength, stamina, and\nskill as a Pokémon Trainer from a young\nage by working together with his Pokémon.\nBecause of his gentle nature, he has trouble\ngoing all out on weaker opponents, which is\nwhy his Gym is the first one for challengers\nto attempt during the Gym Challenge. He\nalways wears his boots, as apparently they\nlet him dig in his heels when he needs to.
Though his record isn’t the best due to his\nfocus on simply having fun in battles, Milo\nhimself is incredibly strong. The rolls of hay\nused in his Gym Challenge each weigh over\n770 pounds, yet Milo can roll them\naround easily. Wooloo tend to roll around,\ntoo, and sometimes they can get carried\naway and roll out of the Gym Stadium. It\nhas become common in Turffield to see the\nwhole town chasing after Milo, who is in\nturn chasing after a stray Wooloo, along\nwith Yamper.

Her father is a fisher, and her mother works\nin the marketplace. Perhaps because of\nher parents, she grew up playing with\nWater-type Pokémon and eventually made\nit all the way to being a Gym Leader.\nShe met Sonia during their Gym Challenge,\nand they continue to be close friends.\nNessa often gives Sonia fresh seafood from\nHulbury. She has declared that Milo of\nTurffield is her rival, but Milo responded by\nsaying that his rival is himself.
Nessa is incredibly popular, both as a Gym\nLeader and as a model. Many people even\nthink the Gym Leader Nessa and the model\nNessa are two different people, since she\nshows a completely different attitude in\neach role. She had the misfortune of being\ndefeated in the first match of the Finals,\nand those who knew of her indomitable\nnature worried that this would impact her\nwork as a model. Despite her loss, she was\nstill able to give her fans a perfect smile.\nThings were not nearly as peaceful with her\nGym, however...

Kabu is a Pokémon Trainer who was invited\nfrom the Hoenn region. There were a few\ntimes where he was very close to becoming\nChampion, but victory always seemed to\nelude him at the last moment. Because of\nthis, he adopted a no-holds-barred\napproach to battling for a time, but even\nthat did not bring the results he wanted. He\neven dropped to the minor division at one\npoint, but after a fantastic battle with Leon,\nhe regained faith in his own potential.\nHis motto is to keep learning and training\nas long as he is alive.
Interview with Challenger Kabu\nQ: How do you see your own battle style?\nKabu: Just, straightforward, direct. I’m still\nyoung, so I try to keep things simple. Just\nburn as hot as I can, you know?\nStill, I’ve hit a bit of a losing streak, so I’ve\ntried incorporating Will-O-Wisp into my\nPokémon’s move set. That’s one thing I\nwant to tell everyone—experiment with\nevery possibility of your Pokémon. Moves,\nAbilities, items... Try everything, and there’s\nsure to be a path forward!

Given special attention from her parents,\nBea trained hard with her partner Pokémon\nsince a very young age. This has honed her\njudgment skills, and she is able to remain\ncalm and collected even when facing dire\nsituations in battle. This leads many to think\nshe lacks emotion, but the truth seems to\nbe that she doesn’t want to show weakness.\nShe is sometimes known to show her true\nfeelings to her partner Pokémon during\nbattles. She is secretly a huge fan of various\nsweets, and this has recently been found\nout by her fans. The additional attention\nhas made enjoying sweets a little difficult.
In order to become strong, one must face\nopponents who are stronger than oneself.\nEven if defeat seems inevitable, Bea will\nstill go all out and try to at least draw.\nIt’s possible that the strict (one might even\nsay too strict) training from her stern\nparents has left a burden on young Bea,\ntaking away her smile. So, who has seen\nBea smile? Her family? Her Pokémon? Or\nmaybe someone else entirely...

He is a young, mysterious Trainer who has\ntaken on the mantle of Gym Leader at a\nvery young age. He has never been known\nto remove his mask in public. In fact, he\nhas at least one hundred masks of the same\ndesign, just to keep spares handy should his\nmask fall off for some reason. He claims to\nhave developed the ability to see deceased\nGhost-type Pokémon after an accident he\nhad when he was four years old, but the\ntruth is still a mystery.
This is a photo that happened to capture\nAllister in his locker room. He can be seen\nclutching the mask that normally hides his\nface, no doubt confronting the fears and\ninsecurities he feels within. Even though he\nhas taken the role of Gym Leader at a very\nyoung age, it is clear that off the pitch he is\nstill very much a normal boy. However, one\nmystery remains—nobody knows who took\nthis photo. Some even claim it was the work\nof Ghost-type Pokémon.

Opal is the oldest Gym Leader in the Galar\nregion. She took over for her mother 70\nyears ago and has kept the position since.\nHowever, she feels that her own values\nhave reached their limits, and thus she is\ncurrently looking for a worthy successor.\nShe claims that she gives deliberately tricky\nquizzes because people reveal their true\ncolors when in a pinch, but many speculate\nthat in reality, she does it out of pure spite.
Opal has thrust the duties of Gym Leader\nonto Bede, who had his Gym Challenger\nstatus revoked. That being said, she still\nshows up at the Gym Stadium every day,\ngiving unsolicited advice, coming up with\nnew quiz questions, and practicing various\nperformances. What is this “pink” she\ninsisted others show her? Maybe a clue lies\nin a comment she made during an old\ninterview. “Keep thinking about the right\nanswer, and eventually you’ll create the\nright answer.”

Gordie is a young rising star that many\nsuspect will be the Champion someday.\nThough Rock-type Pokémon are typically\nknown for being rough and unrelenting,\nGordie has worked hard to achieve victory\nthrough a refined and graceful battle style.\nHe always tries to keep his fans happy and\nthus is very popular among the audience.\nOn the other hand, he has the surprising\ntendency of shutting himself away in the\nlocker room when he is defeated, making\npostdefeat interviews a rarity. This doesn’t\nbother most of his fans, though, and they\nsee this behavior as endearing.
Gordie is one of the top Trainers of the\nGalar region, both in terms of popularity\nand skill. His strict training style means that\nhis Gym has few Gym Trainers, but he does\nhave quite a fan base. Gordie does his best\nto make sure his fans are happy, often seen\ngiving out autographs or hosting events.\nThere are currently three photo albums of\nGordie, all published through the support\nof his fan base. This card shows another\nspecial photo, taken specifically for this\npurpose at a photo studio.

Melony has been a Gym Leader since she\nwas in her twenties. She is also known\nas a very effective coach, but her coaching\nstyle is incredibly strict. Her battle style is\nfittingly severe and stoic, as well. Any\nGym Trainers who manage to remain under\nMelony are sure to be powerful opponents.\nThus many see Circhester Stadium as a\nmajor roadblock for Gym Challengers. Many\nquietly speculate that Melony’s harsh\nbattle style is due to a fight she had with\nher son.
Melony wanted Gordie to take over as the\nGym Leader of Circhester, while Gordie\nwanted to dedicate himself to Rock-type\nPokémon. The Pokémon battle between\nthe two ended up dividing the whole town.\nEver since that day, Melony and Gordie\nhardly ever see each other. That being said,\nMelony supposedly managed to become\nthe first member of Gordie’s fan club.\nGordie seems to have a complicated\nexpression in their photo together, but\nthen again, that may just be one’s\nown imagination...

Spikemuth lacks a Power Spot that would\nallow Pokémon to Dynamax, and thus not\nmany fans come to visit the town. Piers\nfeels responsible for allowing his town to\nfall into obscurity and dilapidation.\nOnce in battle, Piers tends to get riled up\nand will often reveal his strategy early on,\nbut he has the strength and skill to triumph\nregardless. However, his true passions are\nsinging and song writing, and his talents in\nthese fields are well-known. As such, he\ncurrently hopes that his younger sister will\ntake over as Gym Leader.
Here are some words from Piers when he\nfirst became the Gym Leader of Spikemuth.\n“Uh... ... ... The name’s Piers. It’s too bad\nwe can’t Dynamax our Pokémon in\nSpikemuth, but you could say we have a\nmore authentic style of Pokémon battles.\nAnd I plan on showin’ that off. And well...\nI have a younger sister, and she’s got way\nmore talent than me. But until she’s old\nenough to become Gym Leader, I’ll keep\nrockin’ with my crew and make sure\nSpikemuth stays lively!”

Raihan is commonly regarded as the most\nskilled Gym Leader in the Galar region. He\nhas striven for victory in every environment,\nand as a result, he has adopted a battle\nstyle where he utilizes weather effects to\ntheir fullest. It is rumored that he could\neasily become another region’s Champion\nshould he choose to move, but it seems\nthat to Raihan, defeating Leon is much\nmore important. His uploaded selfies are\nquite popular. Occasionally he’ll post a\nphoto that only shows a sandstorm.
Raihan started taking selfies so as to never\nforget the pain of his defeats, but more\nrecently he has been taking photos showing\noff his training routine, his fashion choices,\nand the like, causing some fans to leave\nharsh comments whenever he loses to Leon.\nIt’s true that Raihan is on a ten-nil losing\nstreak against Leon, but no other Pokémon\nTrainer has managed to KO as many of\nLeon’s Pokémon as Raihan has. Raihan no\ndoubt looks forward to taking a selfie after\nfinally defeating Leon.

Leon is known far and wide for taking part\nin the Gym Challenge at the tender age of\n10 years old—and even more so for claiming\nvictory in the Champion Cup on his first\nattempt. Ever since that victory, he and his\npartner Charizard have remained unbeaten\nin both League and exhibition matches. He\nis called “the unbeatable Champion” and is\na hero to many Trainers. He has but one\nweakness: a dismal sense of direction.\nBut don’t worry—wherever he ends up, he\nmakes sure everyone has a champion time!
Leon’s dream, even when he was still the\nChampion, was to make Galarian Trainers\nthe strongest Trainers in the world. In order\nto fulfill that dream, he has rebuilt Rose\nTower into the Battle Tower, a facility\ndedicated to Pokémon battles. People say\nthat he seems even more lively now than\nhe was as Champion. Leon has also\ncommented that another reason he likes the\ntower so much is because it’s impossible to\nget lost inside. Leon’s biggest problem now\nis apparently coming up with a new\nsignature catchphrase to replace\n“Let’s have a champion time!”

Mr. Rose is in fact a talented Trainer, coming\nin second place for a past Champion Cup.\nAs the chairman of the Pokémon League,\nand as the president of a large business\nconglomerate, he is truly a hero to the\nGalar region, working tirelessly to ensure\nits prosperity. His thoughts and words don’t\nalways match, and thus many say it’s hard\nto tell what he’s talking about. In fact, it is\nsaid that only his secretary can tell what\nhis true intent is.\n(NOTE: The above text was submitted by\nhis secretary.)
Chairman Rose is a dedicated philanthropist\nwho spent much of his own time and money\nresearching the ancient disaster known as\nthe Darkest Day, all in order to solve\nGalar’s energy issues. He firmly believes\nthat actions speak louder than words and\nwill often make decisions without revealing\nhis thinking to others. For better or for\nworse, it is this style of leadership that has\nallowed the Macro Cosmos conglomerate\nto grow to where it is today.\n(NOTE: The above text was submitted by\nhis secretary.)

Bede spent some time living in an\norphanage after his family ran into some\ntrouble when he was young. He always had\ndifficulty getting along with others and\nwould constantly get into fights. That is\nuntil one day Chairman Rose visited the\nfacility. Rose gave Bede a Pokémon, which\nchanged Bede’s life forever. He showed\ntalent as a Trainer and threw himself into\nPokémon battles, becoming stronger by the\nday. He has joined the Gym Challenge with\nan endorsement from the chairman himself,\nand Bede plans to prove that the chairman’s\nfaith was not misplaced.
He was appointed by the former Gym Leader\nOpal to become the new Gym Leader of\nBallonlea Stadium. The general consensus\nis that Opal’s harsh training has in fact\nmellowed him out. Though he himself has\nnever confirmed nor denied this, it should\nbe noted that he no longer refuses to give\nautographs. Additionally, it seems his skills\nas a Pokémon Trainer have also increased\nrather dramatically. Recently, his intrusion\nduring the Finals of the Champion Cup has\ngained popularity, and fans wish to see that\nkind of performance again. Bede himself is\nnot sure how to react.

This mysterious figure has taken it upon\nhimself (herself?) to dress up in the fashion\nof the Pokémon League’s official mascot.\nThe mysterious individual is known to many\nas “the Ball Guy” but in point of fact, all\nare mystified when it comes to this person’s\ntrue identity or age or even gender. While\nthe Ball Guy is known for her (his?) habit of\nhanding out rare Poké Balls here and there\naround Galar, it’s a mystery as to why or\neven where these balls come from. It’s all\nvery mystifying...

Mustard is the former Fighting-type Gym\nLeader and is regarded as one of the\nstrongest Champions in Galar’s history—\nreigning undefeated for 18 years. His\nintense drive for strength meant he insisted\non discipline, both in himself and in others.\nHis character changed drastically, however,\nafter his post-retirement globe-trotting. His\nsudden purchase of a deserted island\nadded to the surprise of those around him.\nWhen asked for his reasoning, he answered\nwith a smile, “There are lots of ways to be\nstrong in this world. I want to see them all!”\nThe name “Isle of Armor” was also his idea.
This photo was taken about 50 years ago,\nwhen Mustard defeated the Fairy-type Gym\nLeader and went on to become Champion.\nHe reigned undefeated until he lost his\npartner Pokémon. After this, his losses\nstarted to mount. He remained popular\neven after losing the mantle of Champion,\nbut decided to retire after the league\nchairman at that time asked him to win in a\nrigged match. Mustard developed an\nobsession with video games after his\nretirement. Apparently he held off while he\nwas still active in order to maintain his\nimage to his fans.
Honey is the former CEO of a trading firm.\nShe met Mustard while visiting Galar during\none of her many business trips, and it was\nlove at first sight. They were married shortly\nafterward. She now works as the dojo\nmatron—cooking, cleaning, advertising,\nand taking care of finances. She also keeps\nan eye on the mental health of students.\nWhat’s more, she’s also the creator of Max\nSoup. She used the forest mushrooms in her\nsoup as a way to cut costs, and this caused\nher Pokémon to Gigantamax. Her latest\nambition is to sell ready-made Max Soup\nacross the world. Her motto is teamwork.
Honey wasn’t a Trainer initially, but after\nspending time with Mustard, she tried\nit out on a whim. She quickly developed a\ntalent for battle, and the rumor among\ndojo students is that she may even be on\npar with Mustard himself. Thanks to taking\ncare of very powerful Pokémon at the dojo,\nHoney has also gained a lot of physical\nstrength of her own. Now she can handle\neven powerful Pokémon, like Gallade.
Avery comes from a long-standing family of\npsychics. Each Psychic-type Gym Leader of\nGalar has been from the same bloodline as\nAvery, and thus, Avery has been destined to\nbear the burden of Gym Leader since even\nbefore he was born. Ever since he was a\nchild, Avery could freely move things with\nhis mind but lacked other skills, such as\nteleportation or telepathy. This has caused\nthe rest of his family to label him as a\ndisappointment. Avery has a great deal of\nrespect for Slowpoke, as they go about\ntheir business at their own pace, no matter\nwhat others say.
Avery has always been very proud and\nwould levitate any opponent who dared\ndefeat him. This behavior caused his status\nas a Gym Trainer to be revoked. During this\ntime of despair and desperation, his\nSlowpoke found a flyer for the Master Dojo,\nleading to Avery’s current circumstances.\nAvery caused friction with many of the other\nstudents initially, but the kindness of Honey\nand Mustard slowly helped him to mellow\nout and become more friendly. Recently he\nhas been training hard with his now-evolved\nSlowbro to prove himself better than a\ncertain new student at the dojo.
Klara was originally an underground pop\nsinger. She promoted herself as a star that\nhad both cuteness and the virulence of\npoison. She energetically held live concerts\nand other events, even selling some Klara-\nthemed collectibles that she made\nherself, but in spite of everything, she only\nmanaged to sell eight copies of her debut\nalbum “Krazy for Klara.” She decided\nbecoming a Gym Leader would help her\ngain more popularity and has been working\ntoward that goal since. She chose the\nPoison type because it matched her image\nand there was less competition.
The training at the Poison-type Gym was a\nlot harsher than Klara was ready for, and\nshe gave up after two days. It was during\nthis time she saw an ad for the Master Dojo\nduring a late-night TV show. The master\nseemed kind, and Klara thought it would\nhelp her become strong without having to\ntry too hard, so she immediately called in\nto apply. Normally, Klara’s sole focus is to\nbe doted on by others, so she puts only\nthe bare minimum into her training, but\nrecently a new student at the dojo has\ncaused a change of attitude. She now works\nsecretly with her Slowbro to better herself.
Peony is a former Steel-type Gym Leader.\nHis powerful and dynamic battle style\nmeant that anyone stuck on pitch\nmaintenance had their work cut out for\nthem. To this day, he is known as “Steel\nPeony” and has many fans, especially\namong men. This photo is actually a\ncomposite photo, made before Peony came\nto the Crown Tundra. It was originally a\nposter Peony stuck in the travel planner he\nmade for his daughter, but she threw it\naway in short order. Peony liked the way it\nlooked and decided to use it for his\nLeague Card.
Though this is seldom addressed publicly,\nPeony is, in fact, Rose’s younger brother.\nPeony was compared to his brilliant older\nbrother since he was born, causing him to\ngradually rebel and become a delinquent.\nHe eventually ran away from home, only to\nbecome a Gym Leader once his talent was\nrecognized. He was even Champion once,\nbut shortly afterward, Rose became League\nChairman. This caused Peony to vanish\nentirely from the League. The Copperajah\non Peony’s team has been there since it\nwas a Cufant. It was the first Pokémon\nPeony caught together with his brother.
